dbx07q,"NTA. Your response is perfect. Stay the course until this generation is done. 

I once brought a friend home for Xmas when my mom was dating a cool guy with family of these people, his mom especially. He introduced himself and explained that since he couldn't fly back home to California, he was staying with me who he considered his ""New York family"" cue awwww. 2 sentences later Karen asks him how Christmas is celebrated in his culture.

Face-palm.

He took it in such stride, and answered ""Everything is pretty much the same in California except no snow! Glad to have snow this year.""

Stay classy, a bad reaction will only reflect on you."
dbx0gl,"NTA.  That kind of ex can mine your friends for information about you.  That affects your safety.  Even without the social implications, that alone is reason to cut ties."
dbx6op,she caught wild mice... to rerelease into the wild... somewhere else ?
dbx75g,"NTA. As a guest, I wouldn't expect a vegetarian host to cook meat. It wouldn't even cross my mind as a possibility."
dbx8p6,ESH. This behaviour on both sides is inappropriate for the workplace.
dbxg39,"YWBTA if you don't delete the picture, IMO. If this person is really your friend, I don't think it should be that big a deal for you to take the pic down--is it really any skin off your nose, especially since it seems to bother your friend?"
dbxgsd,"A couple of notes I thought I'd share:

I was a psych/biochemistry major in college, now in psychiatric drug research (PhD student studying psychiatric drug development). I'm not a clinician but based on what you shared he definitely doesn't need a second opinion. These are all super common symptoms, combined with the fact that he received a diagnosis from a psychiatrist who would be able to tell very easily (the tests/determinations for schizophrenia have very high validity and reliability). Secondly, based on what i've learned not only from taking classes but talking to clinicians, the scariest symptom a person can have is **command hallucinations**, which is, as it sounds, any sort of sensory perception (typically auditory in the form of voices) telling a person to do something. The reason why these are scary is because people usually act upon them, they tend to escalate, and the person truly believes they have to do what the voices say. A lot of high profile acts of violence (ex: Reagan's attempted assassination) are the result of command hallucinations. Schizophrenia is also degenerative, leading to worsening of the condition as it progresses. Schizophrenic patients lose brain volume, which can have an array of adverse effects. So while he may now be sweet and non-violent, this may change, and he's already ""compromised"" in the sense that he's suffering from these hallucinations already.

Based on this super long-winded basis, I would say you're definitely NTA and your BIL needs help. Your fear that he could turn violent without warning is very realistic given his symptoms, especially if he continues to not get treatment (although it sounds like his family is taking the steps to get him help)."
dbxhru,YTA - and I definitely get why your boyfriend is upset. You just proved you can be bought.
dbxklx,"NTA - accidents happen and the guy overreacted.

You asked him to stop because he was scaring you - shouldn't that make think hard about your relationship?"
dbxknp,"NAH, but oh my god do not let her go to the Philippines for a medical procedure just because it’s cheaper or quicker. Look up botched Philippines breast implants. That shit is unbelievably dangerous."
dbxwzx,"NTA.

She is derailing the game and not taking your setting seriously by trying to be a murder hobo. DnD is a communal game, meaningful decisions should be made by the players in response to situations setup by the GM. The GM curates the experience and the players engage with it in good faith.

As someone who has run a few games, here is an option to consider - let her act out in game and have the guards handle it."
dbxzhr,NTA.  Anyone who jams their hands in my face to ask for something is most definitely *not* getting anything.  They were rude to think that’s how you do things.  You were clearly being generous and if they’d simply asked nicely like a normal person they probably would have gotten some.

If you are splitting the bill, any savings promotion on that bill belongs to all of you.  As you said, there was probably a Samsung speaker or other electronics that everyone could have enjoyed.  If not, it would at least need to be discussed who gets what."

Yall suck because it's his birthday and listening to seone play piano is super boring for most people (source: I play the piano )"
dbyd9z,"NTA, you can't help someone who doesn't want help.  It's not your business.  If she seeks you out, that's a different story."
dbyf99,"YWNBTA

It's possible she doesn't understand how weird/creepy this is. Let her know that this makes you uncomfortable, but don't accuse her of being controlling. It's possible she's just being overly excited about this shiny new toy and isn't thinking about how it's making you feel."
dbyjta,"YTA stop trying to get a deal. The mom is the main landlord , accept the rent or find somewhere else"
dbymmj,"NTA- As long as you are respectful, you should definitely bring this up. She's young an inexperienced, but should know better than to blast alarms in a shared space for that long."
dbytnn,"NTA, you weren't being deceptive, he's just being manipulative."
dbytxn,YTA. You don’t get to go to parties for people who don’t like you.
dbyv8z,NTA but that was kinda confusing to follow. If I understood it right you’re NTA and should now worry about them
dbz0sh,NTA!  Do not say a thing to M.  You know this only as it pertains to your job.  If you share confidential information such as this you can get wrote up.  Show your boss they can trust you.
dbz1xt,NTA - if you don’t want him over you don’t have to
dbz3ke,"Uggggghhh, no NTA. What your boyfriend is saying is that he thought you’d be more comfortable letting him control you by now. You’re doing nothing wrong at all."
dbz75n,NTA - Ask and you shall receive. Not like you warned them before or they have to use it.
dbz95m,"YTA. What the fuck man? You actually have no idea if he went through the proper channels. What purpose did it serve to warn Aaron? You gave him a heads up and not Blake that his boss was suspicious of him? He may have acted pompously, but everyone deserves to work in a safe and professional environment. You may have tipped off the boss enough that the company can skate by an investigation and then return to not giving a fuck afterwards."
dbzckv,"LOL... pop out a cube next time he gets dismissive and solve it in 30 seconds, then have him try. Getting embarrassed in front of girls at parties a few times after opening his mouth about how it's not a big deal should shut him up. NTA"
dbzido,"A lot of people here probably aren't going to understand what a finsta is, fair warning.

I don't think you're a bad person for venting about a relationship, but you also have to accept that all social media is technically public once you allow anyone but yourself to enter a space. Anyone can leak it at any time. 

NAH, she has a right to be upset but if anyone goes and talks to her then they can make their own judgment. Hell, my current boyfriend of a year was talked about on his ex's finsta and he isn't a bad guy to me now that I actually heard both sides of the story."
dbziyn,"Bills are split by roommates, theoretical bills are not.  If you're making a personal profit off your bill split, something isn't even now is it?

dbzk34,"YTA

He was being good enough to provide you with the account that was really important to you and you kind of disregarded and disrespected him in return. Then you were shocked... SHOCKED... that he took back the toys you were borrowing from him in order to disrespect him."

IF there is a fire, they’ll destroy her car to access the hydrant, so you might be doing her a favor. 

Plus f*ck ppl who block emergency service stuff.

Edit: grammar"
dbzqdz,"YTA. It was her home and her mother. Being “tired of hearing it” is a selfish reason for telling her to stop.

I speak Spanish and English. My SO speaks Arabic and English. His Mother speaks Dutch and English. My daughter is learning Spanish and my son is learning German. Of course there will be conversation that not everyone will understand. That’s modern life."
dbzrcg,"NTA. It doesn't sound like you're joining the military to avoid having to care for your father it sounds like you're joining the military for unrelated reasons and are going to not be able to care for your father because you are in the military oh, and frankly you might be able to do more to help your father financially or what not if you had a stable career rather than if you were the actual caretaker"
dbzyqg,"NAH, he doesn’t owe you to tell you about something he is doing to his own body, but at the same time I understand why it would be nice to just let you know beforehand."
dc0229,NTA. Your uncle is a greedy dick. This sounds like a bad movie plot tbh
dc0325,"NTA.  Even without the story of your coworker being a jerk.  It is YOUR chair.  It doesn't matter if you use it to hold files between uses.  It is the companies obligation to purchase a chair and if he can't wait until they have the money, he should invest in his own or bring one from home."
dc0cef,"By 'serve your nation', do you mean join the army?
Because you're TA for thinking he should be forced to do that. That law is bullshit.
But you're NTA for criticising your friend for being lazy.
As a gamer myself, I get the appeal of them.
But he's a grown man and needs to prove he can act like it if he wants to go overseas"
dc0dei,YTA. If your brother knew the price from the start he would pay half of it. You don't deserve the 90%. It's 50/50. Don't be a selfish asshole.
dc0e7s,"NTA, BECAUSE, she said that the truth needed to be said to someone all the while insulting her daughter, which like you said isnt the way to go about things. I will admit though, it's kinda petty, lol."
dc0f8u,"NTA - Dude, grow a spine! A valid answer is no. In the case of the Uncle, asking for a specific date is not out of bounds. Don't get bullied."
dc0gd0,"YTA for agreeing to this method of repayment. If you didn’t want this, you shouldn’t have taken the money. Finish your work, fill out the form, and move on."
dc0k7n,"YTA

I love traveling, and I often run off during the holidays. My SO and I often travel without each other, and don't believe partners need to be on every trip.

 But THREE years in a row you do this to your girlfriend for both Christmas and New Years?? 

Holy smokes. When will special occasions with her become a priority? I'd be more than pissed. Ya, you're at a point you're totally committed to the trip, so too late. But spending the holidays with your girlfriend three years into a relationship should have been a consideration well before now. 

Year one I get. Year two, I'd be hurt. Year three I'd start weighing whether I could rely on my partner to actually prioritize me, and probably start planning my exit strategy."

dc0r0r,"YTA.  


Preston is an annoying jerk.  I have no quibble with that.  


You don't like Preston. I have no quibble with that.  


But you literally invited everybody else in your class but him.  


Your ability to throw parties rests solely on being lucky enough to have parents who let you do it.    


You're a lucky kid. And you used this advantage to basically bully Preston.  


He wasn't asking to come in and be your first gay kiss.  He just didn't want to be excluded from an event that literally everyone else in his grade was attending.  


You did a lot of harm.  You achieved no good. That was a jerk move. Preston may be a complete douche, but unless he was going to ruin your party, you didn't need to exclude him.  


You CHOSE to exclude him. Yes, you CAN do that. But not-being an asshole is a higher bar than that.  We CAN do anything that's not explicitly illegal  


And being emtionally cruel to people isn't usually illegal.  The law won't stop you. Only your basic human decency can do that.  


There's a huge difference betwen ""legally within my rights"" and being a good person."
dc0sjt,"NTA. You've made several requests that she's ignored, and she's taking advantage of you doing her a favor. Give her 2 weeks to get out and stick to it. 

Don't bring up her finances though, that's none of your business. 

&#x200B;

>She also seems to have a habit of making subtle digs towards me that stick with me and upset me a little. For example, she called me a bipolar bitch when I was having a down day and belittled the fact I went to the doctor to get medication.

I don't know if ""subtle"" means what you think it means."
dc10zk,"NTA. I cut off contact with my mother when I was just a little older than you, and it was the best decision I ever made. I'm happier, less anxious, less stressed and healthier.

It sounds like your mom has major problems. But you can't fix her, and you aren't obligated to go down with that ship.

I would suggest trying to calmly explain to her that her issues have taken too much of a toll on you. For now, you need her to respect your space and not call or email. In the future, if she works on getting her life together, you may reinitiate contact, but one way or another, it won't be any time soon.

Sorry you're going through this, and best of luck."
dc17oo,"NAH. I'm going to go out on a limb and say maybe your mom is going through some stuff and she was embarrassed or ashamed there was no food and so she took it out on you. Not saying she is justified in that at all, just saying that maybe your mom has a lot going on right now. I'm sorry that she took away your electronics and gave you a lot of chores--that seems pretty unreasonable. But maybe if you talk to her later, after she has time to think about everything, she'll ease up on you. You sound like a good kid. Hang in there. :)"
dc19gv,YTA - She's your plaything and your are old enough to understand you are wasting a portion of her life. You should just breakup now.
dc1ap1,"NTA.  If she's having trouble making rent or can't afford to go out, she can't go out.  It's a shame, but you should definitely still go.  Definitely take your mom!"
dc1bo9,"YTA, not trusting your own brother, kicking his girlfriend out when you don't even live there anymore and

dc1e2u,"ESH

You are a kid. You haven't learned yet how to deal with testy situations, but you have YEARS to learn. :)

Next time someone, ANYONE, says anything to you while you are in the middle of doing something, say ""hi! gimme a minute to settle myself here"" regardless of what the other person has said to you. Just ignore ALL of it and only acknowledge that you see them.

Once you have taken a moment to hang up the phone, finish dealing with your umbrella, straightening up your clothing, whatever, turn to the person and say something like ""hi! all settled now"" and either let them repeat what they said, or ask them how their day is/went/what they need, etc., depending on the situation.

This allows both them AND you a moment to catch a breath before either of you say something that can cause a situation to blow up like this one did. 

Relationships of ALL types will move in and out of your life. You cannot, and never will be, able to control how someone else acts or what they say, but you CAN control how you act and what you say. 

It is ALWAYS better to take a moment for yourself before you say something."
dc1fkl,"NTA. A big ole ""fuck that"" to what she's demanding. Even if you had agreed to drive her every day to wherever her heart desired, you still would have always had the option to change your mind. Stick to your own commute that works best for you."

If I were you? I’d air it publicly on the discord or social media. “I’m being threatened with being kicked from this tournament because I blocked a staff member who attacked me, here’s the receipts.”

I’m not sure if you want to go that route, but public pressure might change their tune imho

EDIT: just reread the bit about feminine people. 

Yeah for sure air this publicly. They are enabling an abuser. This dude is red flags city and this should NOT be his position."
dc1iy0,"NTA, but I hate to break it to you but if what you wrote is true you’ve gotten caught up In a very unfortunate and unhealthy marriage dynamic that you need to address with your wife."
dc1siy,"YTA. You invited him along. It’s pretty rude, even though you warned him in advance, to say “we will pay for everyone but you”. That’s pretty goddamn rude."
dc1wch,"NAH, but they probably felt like you didn't trust them or thought they would ridicule you and that hurt they're feelings. Just explain you were trying to avoid making a fuss."
dc1wf9,"NTA, but you need to move on. Talk to someone who DOES want to hang out with you."
dc1wql,"NTA. This is just petty high school drama that will get left in the dust when college arrives. If they can’t handle you meeting new people and making new friends they aren’t worth your time 5-10 years from now lol

dc21ns,"My guess is YTA.  If at 20 you already have friends or loved ones complaining about your behavior while drinking you might want to look into that.  You seem awfully keen to prove you ""don't act bad"" when you drink.  That's generally a red flag."
dc225l,"I can understand being frustrated at having to move all the time, but I have to say it sounds like your dad really loves you and is trying his hardest to make you more comfortable at his house; he didn't just shell out money (which is easy if you have it), some of your list items meant he had to have some conversations with his wife and stepkids about their behavior around you, and people typically don't like having those kinds of talks, so for him to willingly do it because you asked it of him speaks volumes as to how much he wants you around. I hope your visits get easier to deal with soon."
dc250o,"NTA. But as a WC adjuster, I wouldn’t be able to terminate any of his benefits unless there was video proof. But letting them know is how they will know to hire a detective to follow and record him."
dc2e93,"NTA. Nicu nurse here. Having a micropreemie in the nicu is very stressful for families, and you need to do what you can to help with that. If that means your SIL doesn't visit unless you are present, then that's what you should do. Hubby needs to support you in this."
dc2ebz,"NAH- You can't have your older dog being attacked on a regular basis; that's not fair to that dog. I'm sure the pit mix is  quite upset that your ex is gone, and it sounds like he requires more attention/supervision than you are able to provide (not a judgement call against OP by any means, I promise!). Since your home seems to no longer be a good fit for the pit mix, the best thing would be to re-home him. Just make sure it's really a good fit before you let him go!

I am a bit curious about the decision to get a cat after re-homing the dog. If you are getting rid of the pit mix *specifically* so that you can get a cat, then that would make you TA. However, If you are getting rid of the pit mix because of the attacks on the older dog, and because he requires more one-on-one time than you can provide, that's a different story altogether in which there are NAH."
dc2efk,"NTA- buuuut

Don't ever tell her. Just get them back and burn them and when she asks where they are just say you have no idea. Seriously I'm saving you right now"
dc2eme,I'd say something again. Because ya 3 times over 2 years is nothing. They probably don't even remember you saying anything. I'd just go to them and be like hey the smell has been really bothering me is there anyway you xan smoke outside?

dc2i2s,"NTA.  


If she doesn't remember saying it, the decent thing to say is, ""I honestly do not remember ever saying that.  However you seem very sure that I did.  I don't agree with that sentiment, now. And I'm very, very sorry that you suffered because of this.  I don't remember saying this, but if you say I did? I'm sorry and please understand that I don't believe this, now.""  


anything short of that? she's being a stubborn asshole. At BEST.  


At worst, this still reflects how she feels."
dc2jei,NTA. Would have been nice if he had just offered you the $10 for a beer or lunch to get lost though. Why go to the trouble of potentially hurting your feelings by going behind your back? I'd be a little pissed tbh.
dc2jqm,"I understand that. I wouldn't have made them fettuccine alfredo because that is obviously unhealthy. There was no mention of ""I can't have any mayo in my diet"", and maybe I'm wrong but I figured a tunfish sandwhich, tomato soup, and whole grain chips would be considered a ""healthy"" meal compared to the vast majority of food that college kids eat."
dc2jqq,"ESH. He has an addiction and shouldn't be lying to you about it. But you've known he's been a smoker for 9 years. It's foolish of you to think that you can change him/end his addiction just by making him promise not to smoke.

He'll quit for good when he's ready. In the meantime, you need to decide if you want to date a smoker or not."
dc2kg9,"NTA. 

You were followed home by a stranger who threatened to trespass in your yard. You told them clearly that they were not permitted to do such a thing. They did it anyways stating clearly that they didn't care. 

It might be a child, but the child clearly knew they were in the wrong. You do not have to be nice to someone who trespasses and refuses to leave."
dc2nzt,"NTA- I mean a white lie would have been preferable, but it sounds like you were painted into a corner by already telling her the place was free? I think you were truthful, albeit direct."
dc2poa,"Lol. NTA. 

You went to stay with your father's side of the family who haven't been in contact with you since you were 4 under the assumption that they wanted to know you now. 

They did not try to make you feel comfortable in their home. Instead they did the exact opposite. 

Your autism doesn't matter here. A lot of the things they have done go against what normal levels of hospitality should be in such a situation. They acted poorly even without taking into account your sensory issues and social anxiety and whatnot. 

Your behaviour, from what you have described, is also not abnormal and should not be expected to have been different. To be thirst into a situation like this is a totally different state with a bunch of strangers is incredibly difficult for anyone. Even a neurotypical adult would have a hard time. For a family trying to get to know you the focus should have been on making you feel more socially comfortable. Any issues they had with your phobias or sensory processing or whatnot should have been left for another time, and should have been addressed with your mum not you. 

It sounds like that side of your family is a side you're better off not knowing."
dc2rg6,"YTA for not just having two flower girls. Like, why was this even an issue in the first place?"
dc2rl9,NTA - For just 3 days with a bunch of people you don't know it's not worth it. I'm getting sick of these expensive hen dos brides are throwing but also don't want to spend any of their own money on. You can go on a week long holiday of your choice with that money.

It’s one thing for the child to just be existing at home, yes there might be some screaming, he might jump off of stuff and his the ground hard...but I don’t think it’s okay for the kid to make a habit of pounding on walls.

Either you talk to the parents kindly about it, and also be understanding that it would mean they have to do more parenting than they are used to doing, or try talking to the land lord about it."

dc3lto,"NTA - They offered the holiday as a gift, and the fact that he pays for your step mother's children while she doesn't do the same for you is unfair"
dc3lu4,"YTA, but not because what you did was offensive, which is why I suspect you think you're the asshole. Offending someone or being offensive does not automatically make you an asshole - context matters.

You put yourself in a position where you either had to lie or eat a serious penalty to your grade. By getting shitfaced *the day before an important presentation*, you put yourself in a position to where you had to sell your integrity to avoid the consequences of getting shitfaced.

THAT'S why you're the asshole. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't that big of a deal. But this kind of thing gets people in very real trouble all the time. Never put yourself in a position to where you either have to lie or accept an unacceptable penalty."

>I find that's a pretty inappropriate relationship to begin with.

That's NORMAL. They're what, 1-1.5 years apart? Jeez. 



>brags all the time about how pretty she is, and probably says 2-3 times a day to me and my husband about how much he loves her

He's a teenager. Hormones are a thing. Puppy love is a thing. Chill. 




>it feels like he's rubbing it in my face that he cares about someone else and not me

This is just...strange. It's time to cut the cord, lady. Accept that you won't be the only female I'm his life from here on out. 



>I'm afraid that this is going to lead to them having sex,

Now here, I agree he's too young. But I'd start mentally preparing NOW because one day sooner than later he will have sex. 



>his grades dropping.

Do the parenting thing and set boundaries and make rules. If he wants to see her and his friends, he's gotta maintain his grades. 



>He acts like I am the devil, because I don't necessarily approve of her and I've made this known.

It's fucking bizarre how you act and feel towards this CHILD. Like...what. This whole post really just seems like you need to accept that your baby boy is growing up. 

Friendly advice. The more resistance you show towards your teenager about things you dont approve of, the more they'll actually do whatever you're against AND do it behind your back. I'm not surprised he acts like you're the devil considering how you already hate his first girlfriend and how you react towards her."
dc3w4v,"NAH. He tried to do something nice, doesn't sound like he intended to trick you or lie about the eggs. But it's also not your fault that you can't stomach eggs. Just a poor misunderstanding!"

dc5fj4,"I’m not going to judge whether you would be the asshole or not, but I am going to share my story. 

I’m a gay guy, and my grandmother died 18 years ago. We were very close. I spent time at her house once a week, and would stay with her for a week or two each summer. When she was dying, and went on hospice, instead of hiring help, my parents and I took shifts and gave her 24 hour care. In that time we grew much closer, and my grandmother showed me a softer side of her I had never seen before. It was clear she was mentally getting herself ready to die. 

One night in one of her last few weeks, when she was only awake a couple hours a day, she asked me if I like girls. I honestly wasn’t entirely sure what she meant, so I asked. She told me that she wanted to know if I liked boys or girls—because she didn’t mind if I liked boys, except she knows how cruel the world can be, and how people who are different often get treated, and how sad that made her. And she hoped that I like girls, for the sole fact that life was hard enough without having something make it harder. 

I might never forget the tone of her voice as she said, “I know how they get treated...it’s so sad.”

I wasn’t sure what to tell her. But I felt that she was really asking to know that I would be okay when she was gone. And even though I knew she was right, and that being gay would make life harder for me, I also knew that I would be okay. 

So it seemed like the most compassionate thing for her, and also for me in that moment, to tell her that I like girls. I didn’t have to tell her that I was going to date them, or marry them. Even if not in the way I knew she meant, I do like girls. 

I don’t regret choosing not to come out to her. Is the fact that I’m gay central to my relationship with her? No. It was much more important that she loved me and wanted the best for me.  It was much more important that in that moment I was able to offer her some inner peace the way she had so often taken care of me. 

I think the question isn’t whether you would be an asshole not. I think the question is which relationship would be hurt more, and which relationship would recover more easily? Your relationship with yourself if you don’t tell her? Or your relationship with her if you do tell her?

If not telling her would be a burden you have to carry, maybe you should. It wasn’t for me. Maybe you could let go of the idea that she should know. 

But it’s also possible that telling her would cause strife that becomes its own heavy burden. 

If you want to get married and have children, you can focus on that part without saying or even agreeing that it would be a woman you marry and parent with. There are ways to reply tactfully without outrightly lying. 

It’s for you to decide if you should tell her or not. But get clear on why you’d be telling her. Or get clear on why you may choose not to tell her. Both courses of action have their cost. But the clearer you are on why you chose one over the other, the more easily you can reconcile the effects of your actions on everyone involved."
dc5jo9,"YTA for ghosting someone you say is your best friend. It's very possible for two people who communicate well not to have arguments (which I define as yelling, screaming, leaving the house, hurt feelings, etc. You didn't go into detail about your interactions with SO so I might be projecting my own interpretation. Take with a grain of salt). I've been married for almost that same time period and we have yet to argue in any way that makes me so mad I want to text someone and vent about him. We don't always see eye to eye, but we talk about it and communicate how we're feeling, why that is, discuss that it's possible there's no rational reason for this but it doesn't change the feeling, say what we need from the other to feel better or do better... point being, not all couples ""argue."" 

She may be sugar coating things, she may be really good at communicating, or she may just not want to air her dirty laundry with you. But if she's your best friend, you should communicate how you feel and be willing to be vulnerable."

dc5r3j,"A lot of my friendships have ended without formal explanations. If things can peacefully fizzle out that's fine.

dc5tr3,"YTA.

> Am I really obligated to take of her loans?

No, you're not. It's technically your money. But you're still an asshole if you don't help her out even a little bit.

This is your wife. The love of your life. The woman you ostensibly want to spend the rest of your life with. By your own admission, she is struggling with an issue that has taken hold of her life. And you really don't want to give, I repeat, your OWN WIFE a single penny towards fixing that? In my opinion, that is indicative of an asshole.

Let me put it this way. Why should you set aside any money for your child? It's your money. What's that? You love them and want to meet needs for them that they can't meet themselves? Huh, what a novel concept.

EDIT: To be clear, I'm not advocating for you to pay off these loans in their entirety. IMO, you not wanting to pay for ANY of them is the primary issue here."
dc5vj1,"YTA

Let me see if I can summarize:

It seems like the root issue was that you were asked to be home at a certain time and said you would... then decided to go do whatever you felt like at the time you said you would be home. Your Dad didn't appreciate his request being disregarded and you lying to him, but for some reason was still cool with your boyfriend staying the night. For some reason I can't understand your boyfriend is really pissed off at this point... apparently he really want to go to the movies or bowling or something? 

You then proceed to ignore your parents completely after all this and they call around to your boyfriends parents looking for you. You feel this is some sort of betrayal instead of normal behavior for parents who's kid has already lied to them once about coming home after they said they would that night, but you know it will anger your easily angered boyfriend, so you don't tell him. Your father then calls him and that is how he finds out that you are actually at home. 

Your boyfriend is really angry (I really don't get this guy) so he gets his parents to come pick him up and while your outside you get a message that your dad wants to talk. You refuse to talk to your father still. Your father is strangely angered after you lied to him multiple times and then didn't even let him know you were home after he let your angry boyfriend  stay the night. You get pissed that he is pissed and say you will run away. Your boyfriends parents you talk you out of it. 

&#x200B;

Did I get that right? Because in how I am reading it you were a jerk to your father all night and pretty much everything he did seems reasonable. Seriously, how do you think someone should react to you lying to them a bunch?

I also really don't get your boyfriend who seems just mad all the time but for no reason... he can be the asshole too then.

This really doesn't read like you guys are adults. The rules being set on you don't make sense for an adult. The way you respond and treat other people doesn't sound like an adult... pretty much this whole thing makes way more sense (other than letting your boyfriend stay the night) if you were 14."
dc5vne,"YTA if you ""**confront""** her. If you're genuinely interested in repairing the relationship then you need to have a calm and rational talk with her.

If you really think you cant go back to being friends then just leave things as it is. I doubt you'll get an apology if you confront her."
dc5w3m,"I'll go with NTA, but I don't think you should call her out on that post. What's the point? She likely won't apologize anyway.

To be honest, I don't think you should call her a friend in the first place. She seems extremely self-interested, and toxic AF."
dc5wuy,NTA--He didn't keep his word. He has no integrity. This doesn't mean you have to cut him out of your life just don't do business with him anymore.

So here is the thing with kids... you have to make the choices that will be best for them not what will make them happiest in the moment. 

Saying that you don't want an alcoholic who is active in their disease to be around kids... seems pretty reasonable. 

That said, hate the disease not the person. If she can show she is sober again then give her a chance again... not ""all is forgiven"" though, have good boundaries and she has to earn trust back on your terms. Your job is to protect those kids from her so that if she does come back into their lives it will be in a positive way."
dc62ng,NTA in my opinion. We all have preferences and we can’t help that. More like your friend is the asshole for making a deal out of something so insignificant to begin with.

dc6n2x,"It wasn't intentional on your part, but YTA. 

**it's been one week** His being upset over being single isn't an indication he needs a new gf and that will fix everything, it means he's still processing the breakup. (very normal. it's been **one week!**) For your first option/contact to be setting him up on a  date is... incredibly tone deaf. Particularly to have the date offer come from you, the person he's getting over. 

If you really wanted to go down this path, it should have been a friend mutual to both of them (who is not you) setting it up or even her asking him herself. you should have been as out of it as humanly possible."

It's also odd to do this as a joint fund. Shouldn't each couple just buy their stuff for dinner and the ""food fund"" be for various shared items like bread and milk ect? otherwise you run into people having budgeting conflicts, particularly with different wealth levels. 


**However** do keep in mind that a fair chunk of socialising revolves around mealtimes, you guys may be missing out on that by not contributing a couple days. Consider offering to do takeout days, cook very simple and easy meals, ect at least a couple times, and ideally put in enough money so that your portions of dinner will be covered should you choose to join them on occasion or eat some of the leftover for lunch (or just chuck them some money each time. more than enough money is better.)"

Before you do that, though, there are things you can do to try to help the dog improve. Look up videos and guides online about dog training, or hire a trainer to help with her behavioural issues. All you've written can actually be tackled pretty easy with training and a little consistency. The barking at guests, the dog aggression. You can fix the issues and help your dog be happier, because aggression in dogs is often just a response to fear, stress and anxiety. She sounds like a lovely animal, and it would be a really big shame for her to be separated from you when you're clearly her safe space. Talk to your partner about putting the work in to get her trained so that both parties are happy and the dog can stay."

Growing up with a brother of my own, my parents were always careful to ensure neither of us were treated better or worse than the other. If one of us was given x amount of money, then so would the other.

eg. While at university, our mother gave us each £150 a month to cover living expenses that then dropped to £100 a month once we had a job.

It sounds like your parents might be unconsciously playing favourites but I could be wrong. Maybe they see the covering of your medication as a fair exchange but I would  say that since it is essential for you that that is not fair."

I think we need to take into consideration what our peers say about our behavior. In some countries, sharing a table at dinner is normal and refusing to let someone sit is the height of rude. In other societies, sitting down at a table with a stranger is considered pushy and awkward. Certain behavior, in isolation, is not rude or wrong by itself--it depends entirely on how our peers view them. 

So if your peers are telling you that this costume is likely to be considered rude, then you run the risk of being seen as an asshole. The show itself is pretty cool and I think the costume sounds interesting. I just think you have to take into consideration whether you want the fallout from wearing a costume your peers find offensive or that might hurt someone who survived that disaster. 

There is also a small risk of things like this getting out of control if people truly are feeling social media trigger happy. Not saying it will happen, but the only reason you would be an asshole is because your peer group says you are."

Instead of trying to understand her feelings, your response to her is to *cut down on the time she gets to see her dad* (are you kidding me? The fact that he’d even allow this says a lot about him as a parent, too), in order to prioritize your potential new baby.

Please allow me to explain. 

I’m a mom of 14yo twin boys. Both are on the autism spectrum and have other sorts of mental health issues. They were born early after a very risky pregnancy. One of my sons is a bit further on the spectrum which has actually resulted in a very confident and intelligent dude. His twin, however, had seriously obnoxious behaviors tied to some of his issues. We tried everything to help this kid. We live in Massachusetts and our school system is fricking awesome. We are so lucky to live here. 

Years of IEPS, therapy, paraprofessionals, you name it didn’t work nearly as well as having one kid in his class stand up to him and really fucking tell him to knock his shit off. And you know what?? 

IT

FUCKING

WORKED!!

A year later and my son has finally looked outside himself to see how his behavior was affecting others. He put it best: Not everyone knows their the bully. 

I would like to gently suggest that you speak to a guidance counselor about what happened. This way, if he needs some support at home he can get it. That’s his parents’ job... not yours. Peace."

People say lots of stuff they don't mean when they are in pain and under stress. However that doesn't lessen the way you feel. Self advocating is important especially when you are a care taker. This is a stressful time for your mom being hospitalized. And food is one of the few things they have a choice over and let me tell you its patients most complained about topic. When people are in the hospital they have so little control over what's going on that they try to control whatever they can, in this case its berating family and the food. This is NORMAL. Take a breathe and even a day or two and reach back out. Hopefully the distance and time will allow both of you to get back into communication.  

I have been working in the medical field for 9 years.  First bedside as a medic and now I work in management. Self care is important. And she's acting the way a lot of terminal patients act. Don't sweat it you are handling this right :)"

You can search for and book the exact flight you want on southwest.com and then you can also cancel/change it later at the click fo a button. There's no need for a travel agent.

That said, I have never booked a hotel through an airline and I'm not sure it's ever advantageous for you to do that. All they do is route you through their own in house travel agency.  If you use your friend to book the hotels, she gets like a 10% commission. If you use southwest to book your hotels, you get nothing and she gets nothing.  I assume she will take a credit card if you book with her so again, I don't know why you would book the hotel through Southwest.

I always book hotels directly through the hotel when possible.  You usually get the best rates that way, unless your friend is offering you a discount. And some hotels give the best rooms and benefits and points  to customers who book directly and the crappiest rooms and no points and benefits to customers who book through commission-based travel agents."

Coming from someone who is in this situation, take care of yourself OP.  It’s hard. It doesn’t get easier. But it’s your family member and you love them, so this is what you do. Sometimes blowing up at them really cannot be helped, especially if they’re really being an ass that day.

dcln04,"NAH... if she asks. If she asks for your opinion on her relationship I would give an evidenced-based opinion (i.e. “remember when you made a fancy dinner and they just went out drinking instead”). From my experience people who are insecure in their relationships ask their friends if they think it’s good a lot, so there should be an opportunity. 


I had a situation with a hard headed friend that was in a horrible relationship and because I voiced my opinion without asking I almost lost her friendship. I would just keep it quiet and support her but you can try to work it in slightly (“oh they ditched you again? That seems like a pattern. How does that make you feel?”)"

Just have fun and enjoy the time you have now to perform and be on a stage and sing and enjoy life with your friends. You’re going to miss these times, and if you continue with acting/vocal performance you’ll have many many more opportunities to come. You’ll be fine, I’ve been in your shoes, and I swear life will just get better. Whatever you do, don’t talk poorly about your friend, and don’t engage with others who do.

Clearly Bailey’s parents were not comfortable with her playing with strangers they haven’t met. Yes, you know him and will vouch for him, but they don’t know him. They have 100% say over who their child sees. 

You were fired for your lapse in judgement. The mother feels she can no longer trust your decision making in regards to her child. That is her right as Bailey’s mother. It does not make her an asshole. Take this as a learning experience and move on."

I very nearly start crying if I can hear someone slurping, swallowing, chewing, or breathing heavily while they eat... but you’ve GOT to realize it’s a you problem and not an everyone else problem. You make people feel called out and embarrassed when they haven’t actually done anything wrong. I understand that it’s awful. Believe me, I do. It’s okay to talk to people you’re close to about it IN PRIVATE, but please stop calling people out in front of others and please don’t call out strangers or casual acquaintances. I get it. It’s physically painful. It really is.

Funny story: as much as I hate all those other eating noises, I’m a tooth scraper. This really bothers one of my friends and I’ve become more aware since, trying to make a point not to do it in case anyone around me might be bothered... but most of the time it’s not conscious.

If you believe the cats are being neglected then you should be doing this the legal way, so he can't just adopt more cats and abuse/neglect them too. You should be contacting the authorities if you think animal abuse is happening. There's also the significant possibility that he isn't neglecting his cats, and you just don't go over there often enough to see him spend time with them. For a while when I lived with roommates I had to shut my cat (she passed away recently) in my bedroom while I was away because my roommates would leave front door open and we lived on a busy street. I was actually accused of neglecting her (by a guest) because she had separation anxiety and hated being locked up and would whine at the door periodically. She had pet insurance, a fountain, a 7ft tall cat tree (in my room), ate Ahi Tuna and Salmon everyday, loads of toys, a litter robot and a bunch of other stuff."

dcse87,NTA. having autism doesn’t excuse racist/bad behavior being called out
dcsecn,"~~E S H.~~ Your BIL sucks for all of the shit he pulls but do you normally leave your drug paraphernalia out where anyone can see it, including potentially your child? 

Also you say you're only high when you're ""not responsible"" for your son but what's your plan if the school calls you about an issue when you're tripping? What if your son is home earlier than you expected and you're unable to care for him? What if someone calls child services and they find you high on shrooms?

I think the problem here is that if you're the only parent and you don't want your sister and her husband to help raise your son then you are never NOT responsible for your son any more.

**EDIT**: Given OP has edited his post it's only fair to readress the situation. Based on how OP takes their recreational drugs I don't think it's much of a problem. I'd still be cautious of the snooping in-laws trying to have OP's kid taken away but given OP's precautions I suppose that's unlikely. I'm going to change my answer to **NTA** based on the edit."

dcskq7,"NTA. You’re really just doing a disservice to yourself.

dcswzz, NTA. If your mom agrees with your sister she could have loaned her the money and they both could have been “millionaires”.
dcsxk6,"YTA, although I think telling his parents was primarily your fiance's responsibility. Going around to his parents' house and ""giggling,"" saying ""well, what does it look like"" while ""flashing [your BIL] the ring"" was a very childish way of approaching something that he clearly didn't know about. 

The stuff about his mother ""PICKING UP HIS DANG PRESCRIPTIONS instead of you"" and not wanting her 25-year-old son to grow up, none of which is relevant, suggests that your resentment towards your fiance's family is what prompted you to ""forget"" to announce your engagement to them. If they ""watch LO during the day for you,"" they can't be that bad, and you're obviously comfortable making use of those services.

>this is about my fiance and I, not them..

If that was the case, why did you call your mom and your sisters?"

dctbdv,"NTA - I say this specifically because the teacher should have taken a second look at his information the first time you told him that it was incorrect rather than doubling down. A good teacher would realize that they don't have expertise in a specific field (since knowing that your blood isn't blue is pretty common knowledge) and would have done extra research to find the truth.

Frankly, I think you did a great job doing what you did. Assuming you weren't rude in your correspondence with the teacher, it's important to call people of authority out when they are wrong and it is also important to have those people then take responsibility for being wrong."
dctetr,"YTA - not for refusing to give advice anymore, but for thinking that you know better than everyone else what they should do and how they should live their lives in every situation.

dctfoz,Well you should tell her if she doesn’t start taking care of the does she’ll either need to move or rehome them. You can’t have shit and piss everywhere when you have a baby. You’re a bystander in the neglect so I would do what I said above. Or report her
dcth1c,">Edit: To be clear it's not her kid, it is her Ex's. **And the kid is no longer in the picture.** She just never mentioned she was raising a kid with her ex till now.

dcthc4,"NTA - He is ROTC and this much of a piece of shit when it comes to being on time? I'm sorry if I come across as a bit brash but fucking 'being on time' literally doesn't take any skill, just the tiniest bit of effort.

At this point I would be hard pressed not to feel like he is completely disrespecting you for failing to change his ways."

*I try to show people things that I like so that we can bond/explore that thing together, so that we can expand our relationship through that thing together*

I'm guessing if they just paid attention/watched/read they'd 'get it.'

Also, you want them to like what you do, so you can talk about it to them. If they don't, then you might have to listen to them go on about something you don't find interesting.

Accept that people have different ideas, and those ideas are not inferior, or wrong, or misguided, or because they just haven't tried tofu the way you make tofu, or the way this one restaurant makes tofu, or this one tofu restaurant. Eat your own tofu and stop pushing it on people who don't want it.

If your gf falls asleep during movies, she either just does, or she's not interested. Showing her movies you've seen so you can lead a discussion is just... so tiring. Some people don't like fucking tofu. Just deal."

Huh? What do you mean he hides? From what? He is just giving you space. 

Gotta go ESH on this one, you seem fixated on this guy. Perhaps you can explain better your beef is with him. Or is there a reason you both need to be there? Why not make this daddy/daughter event if Halloween is something y'all share and ex + boo can have an evening to themselves?

dculet,"YTA. You’re not the intentional asshole, you actually sound quite nice. But by being hyper-focused on yourself in front of a friend group, saying derogatory things about yourself, especially when others are listening that weigh more...it’s a selfish asshole move. You’re unintentionally making it “all about you”. 

Find healthier ways of coping with your negative self image, and if you need to seek professional help to deal with deeper core issues, it’s definitely out there. Many people have dealt with a similar burden. It can get better!! 

While you’re busy navigating your way through this one tip that might help is pre-plan before getting to the restaurant. They’ve got menus and nutrition info online so you’ll be set, instead of having your friends complain about it lol.

dcuoes,NTA. Decompression time is important.
dcup5y,"NTA

It's just like telling someone they have something stuck in their teeth. Its uncomfortable,  no one wants to do it but at least you can stop someone from thinking: *""Why didnt anyone tell me?""*

It's better for her to know. What she does after learning about it is up to her."
dcupju,"NTA- you don’t have to do what you don’t want to *however you also do*. If a court orders that your father look after you a certain amount of time per week/month, because you’re a minor it’s going to be that way. He will be responsible for you. If you’re not happy doing that and want to make it difficult and get courts involved they will likely side with you but there’s probably going to be a cost associated with that and someone has to pay that."
dcusgc,"YTA if you asked him to sit elsewhere without explaining. Talk to him like an adult and tell him that you would rather use the bus time as a relaxation period to read and listen to music. Most reasonable adults would have no issue with this explanation.

I don't know if this is the right angle to take since she already told you she doesn't like the music.

dcv773,NTA - she's one of his exes? She's probably just trying to cause drama between you two.
dcv9q0,"NTA - no one deserves to be abused or put in harms way. If your FIL chooses to be there, that is on him.

If he falls and needs help up, he can contact the fire department for assistance. There are ways they can help themselves without your husband doing it for them and being subjected to the abuse. He is enabling them but that is his choice at the end of the day. 

You can also put in clear boundaries - ie they are not allowed at your home without prior permission, if assisting any abusive stances will not be tolerated and you will leave immediately. You can put in whatever rules you see fit. Just make sure they are clear. 

The other thing is if the FIL mental faculties are not there, you can go after power of attorney to put him in a home. You would have to prove that the wife is incapable of caring for him but that is a discussion for a lawyer."

dcwfer,"ESH.  You didn't ask your ride to leave earlier, you *told* her she should leave earlier right when you guys were already stressed.

Your intent is fine, your delivery was poor.

During a calm time, apologize to her for snapping at her.  Then say it makes you uncomfortable to be getting there so late and having so many tardies.  Ask her how she feels about it, and genuinely listen - this will make her more open.  Then politely ask if she'd be open to leaving earlier.

Plan B - drive yourself every day, or at least in days she doesn't show up early enough."

dcxbcv,"NTA - bad businesses need to die, especially ones that are shitty to people.

dcxcnb,"NAH or NTA. Ask her why she is doing it. Is it because of time? Is it an energy/motivation thing? (ADHD and Depression for example clear off at the weirdest times). Talk to her about it. Compromise where it needs to be.

2. Checking what thing she finds annoying and agreeing to stop it/change time to do it."

They didn't like the experience initially. Go with someone who can appreciate this and one you like to go with."
dcxon9,NAH- If he wanted to spend time away from you though he would probably tell you. I've been through the same thing with my husband and he just wants to hang out with me no matter what I am doing. Are you choosing to sleep over him though? That might be a sign of something going on with you.

dcxwvp,"YTA. It’s only a month, and your parents will pay you for it. She’s doing something important for university that will help her succeed in life. Where else would she stay if you said no? I’m sure it would hurt her if her older brother said that he couldn’t do such a favor just because he didn’t feel like being around her. She’d just be staying at your house, since she has her program she probably wouldn’t even be home a lot."
dcxyuw,"NTA but if she's already going on these trips with them I think she's already ""opened up"" if you know what I mean. 

To be honest, if that's not your thing I'd cash out and let her live her that life. It's hard to change people's minds on stuff like that and an ultimatum may just be met with defiance. 

That is unless you have kids or own a home together.....then maybe you need to get creative."
dcy33b,YTA- You need to write your professor an e-mail taking responsibility for her failing the project. This was a very irresponsible and asshole way to go about getting your dream job.
dcy7yf,NTA.  The fact she replied like that says she's chosen to use her autism as an excuse not to improve behaviors she *knows* are rude.  That makes her a jerk.
dcyave,"OK this needs to be in the OP. 

You aren't TA for keeping your old text conversations. 

But it sounds like you might be TA for teasing her about liking you. Either she still likes you and you're teasing her about it, or she now sees you as a friend and you're making the situation uncomfortable. 

You're definitely TA for telling her she's your only friend. Not cool to put that much weight on anyone, even if it's true."
dcycj1,"You would not be the asshole if you asked. If you demanded, however, or failed to respect their decision if they don't choose to not go, you would be an asshole.

dcymkb,"NTA. She should grow up and learn to communicate properly. 

Buuuut also this story sounds very one-sided, I feel like the comments would be drastically different if she wrote the post. Did you refuse to pick her up unless she uses your exact words? Or did you just ask her kindly to ask but you'd pick her up anyway?"

If you give people help, and they are not appreciative, continuing to help with only lessen their respect as they will (correctly) assume that you don't have the self respect to stand up for yourself. Politely become unavailable."
dcz37r,"YTA. But only if you really are serious about your relationship. If you're not, and you need the freedom to go do your thing, then that's a different story. But man up and break up with her if that's the case. She obviously takes it seriously, and you owe her the truth."
dcz6dg,Your sister is TA because she was a bad owner who just wanted a cute kitten who didn't want the work.   You might also be TA if you let him roam around outside without being on a leash.  It's horrible for cats and the environment to just let them run wild.  They kill native animals and have a decreases life span themselves.  Indoor cats average 13 years or older where outdoor cats average around 5 years.

Don't start it assuming she's trying to screw you. Give the benefit of the doubt. It also puts her in the position of having to explicitly say she expects you to pay for all of it if that's the case. She'll likely realize that's unreasonable and not want to say it out loud so if that was the intention it will likely change."

It would drive me bananas to have someone take the liberty to move my things when it's been communicated it's not appreciated. But it would probably also bother me to have the eyesore of trash cans sitting out on the street 24/7. 

I would explain to her that you have a disability which is why you choose to keep them out there since it's difficult to manage the back and forth.

You need to stop being a pain in the ass, we are talking about meeting another person, that's it. There's no sort of expectations or commitment.

My Mom turned 60 this year and she fucks dudes that are younger than ME (turned 34 this year). Notmally when I meet them I scream they aren't my father and run out of the room sobbing to make it super weird for them. Then I come back and properly meet them.

Your Dad is trying to manipulate you into doing what he wants, which isn't cool, but frankly I don't believe you have been honest at all about how you're feeling.

I mean why do you even continue to talk to them? Because they are your Dad? That cliche is as dead and buried as your realtionship with your Father."
dd0hlt,uhhhhh.  I wouldn't so much *tell*  him what to do as *suggest.*  But in the long run you will need to evaluate whether this guy has the self-determination and discipline to be the kind of man you might want to marry.  No opinion from me on that.

While it is noble of you to consider how this would impact your children, you shouldn't be hindering your own opportunities to improve your life.  You're in a rut right now, that's a tough situation.  But it's not a permanent one.  You have the ability to pull yourself up and improve your standing in life.  If you give up your GI benefits you greatly diminish your options for how you can do that.  Even if you transfer it to your ex there is no guarantee that will improve the lives of your children.  But what it will guarantee is that your options become much more limited.  Do not be afraid to be selfish in this situation.

1. Why are you trying so damn hard to hang out with someone who doesn’t appreciate your company? If she’s flaked so much then there is no point in continuing to invite her.  Just wait until she plans something. 

2. You are not the mother of your friends, you maybe the organizer, but you are not in control of making people appear.  Let that go. 

3.  Your friends should have told you to quit inviting this person a long time ago.  Perhaps they enjoy talking about her flaking too much and refuse to set a boundary too?

4.  The flaker needs to be honest and just say she isn’t interested in hanging out with you and your group."

There was literally no need to mention you work at a high end night club and were at a college level club today other than to illustrate you think you’re better than these normies. 

And you acted that way.

dd1fbp,"YTA. From the way you describe your financial situation, this is not an insubstantial amount of money for your family that you’ve lent without any discussion with your wife. 

It’s likely a sunken cost. You won’t be in a position to demand it back, really, without poisoning the relationship. Plus they might need even more cash in the coming months, and then what?

Your wife is probably a bit upset about all that but mostly upset you (1) made an important decision about your shared finances without consulting her and (2) got into a situation that puts you in the middle between her and her parents without talking to her about it. So, it probably feels like a breach of trust. 

I wonder why her parents called you and not their daughter.. perhaps they already had this conversation and she said no. You should apologize, and ask if there’s more to the story."

Shame on your mother for thinking she’s entitled to your money because of “all she’s done for you”. Parents are supposed to take care of their children. Children aren’t a savings account that parents can start withdrawing from once the child reaches adulthood."
dd1pru,"YTA.  In your defense, it is your money and you have no obligation to spend $1,500 on a birthday gift, particularly if you're 23 and not married to her.  However, the fact of the matter is that your motivation here seems to be 100% selfishness.  Making things worse, if you hinted that you were going to get a certain type of gift, it's an asshole move to tease her like that and get something else.  I'm not saying that you had to get that exact necklace, but there's a huge difference between something that costs $1,500 and something that costs $40.  (I don't know the exact price, but we're probably talking about something that's at least 90% cheaper.)  You shouldn't get your girlfriend's hopes up like that if you're not capable of following through or at least coming close to following through."
dd1y34,"ESH. You’re using your children to prove a point and get back at your ex, and that’s shitty. Don’t miss something specifically for the kids because you want to be petty. She should of course tell you they have an appointment, but it can’t always be on her days."

For a long time mental health was swept under the rug and kept hush-hush, so I get where they're coming from but in this day and age it's being discussed, and it needs to be talked about openly so people know it's ok to get help.

Please forgive me if this is a bad or offensive analogy, but I'm half Jewish, and when Jewish people question that or tell me I'm not allowed to identify that way because it's on my father's side, I sometimes say, ""Well, I'm Jewish enough for Hitler."" If I'd been living in Germany during the Holocaust, I would have been subject to genocide, even though I'm not Jewish by religious rules. The analogy I'm making is that in your case, you would have been black enough for slave-owners. Sally Hemings was 3/4 white (and was Thomas Jefferson's wife's sister!), and that didn't make her free or save her from rape. You're black enough for racists. Yes, you can pass and that's going to mean you're not subject to instant discrimination on sight, but you're absolutely subject to discrimination from people who know your family or learn more about you socially or see your name on a job application, and in other ways. Every argument for reparations applies to you, for example. Ignoring all that denies the reality of your experience of the world."

Failing that practicality, I would say NTA.  Maybe your wife is feeling like she needs to do more with her life.  Perhaps you could think of something else than university."
dd404h,"NTA. 

It sounds like your friend was under a lot of stress from supporting you, and it could have been almost anything that tipped the scales for her. It just happens that this one is stupid.    
You are not psychic, so this shit aint on you, but she's probably been absorbing a lot of her own shit in favour of helping you so when that ended up being unnecessary this one time, it's like a dam bursting. 

I mean, you offered to give her the money. This could have been fixed, but that's not the problem. The problem is that she's been dropping things for you for a while and... that gets to people. People get burnt out hard without realising. 

Give her some time. Hopefully afterwards she'll be in a better place and you guys can be friends again. Though if you do, do your best to be aware that she's a ""help friend at expense of everything and also not tell that person so it doesn't add to their problems"" type and try to balance things where you can (eg making sure she talks about her problems in her life, doing things for her where you can) and try to rely on things other than her where you can. 

If you guys don't end up being friends again, Then to have a ""help friend at expense of everything and also not tell that person so it doesn't add to their problems"" type of friend is an extremely rare experience, and regardless of sadness of how it ended I hope you can still find joy in the fact that you were loved and appreciated so damned much."

But A is a strong word here.

Your mother was unwell and had to go to hospital and was probably in pain and scared. The fact that you didn't call her or even send a text meant to her that you didn't think about her.

The fact that you got the news that she is alright from somebody else means that you didn't have to worry about her health anymore, but it doesn't mean that you don't have to think about her. How would you feel if you had been the one in hospital and nobody contacts you? It's just about showing a bit of empathy. She is your mother and has surely worried a lot about you in her life and asked you many many times how you're feeling and has cared so so often for your health. Just give back a little.

Next time send a text or give her a quick call, just saying that you got the good news from her friend and that you're glad she's better and wish her a speedy recovery. It takes less than 5 minutes."

Reading your comment, this is how I'd judge it. Generally, it sounds like you have different expectations of how clean your living space has to be. Leaving house work undone once or twice a week is not a big deal to a lot of people. It's not this that makes you TA in my eyes though.


Something about how you phrase your post suggests that you think the housework is, by default, your gf's responsibility, even aside from the fact that she has more spare time than you.

Secondly, the teacher already told her she could. I know my dance teacher sometimes forgets to email me back, even if it's something I think is important. Lastly, what's the worst that could happen? If she doesn't do well then just try again at the next feis! I feel like most people commenting here don't have a full understanding of how Irish dance competitions work and the amount of control each individual has over what they dance. My teachers have actually NEVER told me which dances to take to competition, I've always picked for myself. I think it's smart to get the teachers opinion (such as if she thinks your daughter has a better chance of winning with an easier set dance) but at the end of the day it's up to her! I know how exciting it is to master a new step and FINALLY get to compete it."

He's not clueless, he's just chosen not to do the shopping & cooking (or learn how to) because he's lazy.

I understand your point. I understand why you are insecure. But if he wants to cheat, he will find a way. And it's on him, not on you.

Here's what you can do. Take a deep breath and try to be more secure in your own skin. Confidence and a relaxed attitude are attractive in anyone. Fake it till you make it, as they say, but fake it from deep within (i.e. understand that we control very little in life aside from our reactions and thoughts, and those are difficult enough - might as well smile and enjoy the journey).

Make your boundaries known and understood. I.e. you are monogamous and exclusive. Any cheating = breakup, no ifs, no buts, no excuses.

Entice him to open up to you more so that you can gradually take the others' place. Mind you, don't pressure, just offer emotional support and affection.

Other than that, you are both responsible adults. Good luck!"

Stand up to your parents and explain to them that if they are not willing to correct this behavior, you have no choice but to take matters in your own hands.

homie, I also work in construction. I am a vendor for large commercial projects like hotels and apartments. It is not unprofessional to ask the difference between the bids, especially when there is a substantial difference in price.

Dude can holler all he wants. You tell your contemporaries what he tried to pull on you and his level of professionalism. Guarantee it will have more effect than his tantrum. Also, if someone refuses to bid to you from what dude told them, you can explain how he tried to fuck you and your budget. 

Also, do your subcontracts not say that any and all work necessary to procure and install a complete system is included in the scope of work, even if not depicted clearly on plans? I get ones that say an unlimited number of mobilizations without a price increase, overtime at no charge if needed to keep up with the schedule, and all kinds of crap.

ddeqvx,"YTA so very, very much. This story struck a very harsh chord of anger within me and I'll try to gently explain why.

First off, I'm also native. I'm also enrolled but not super active in my tribe, and I *also* have a very strained relationship with my parents - so at times, aspects of my culture can be rooted in pain, and my primary connection to my people and language are gatekeeped by very toxic individuals in my life. Stories like Sarah's are not uncommon. 

I say all this to explain, as a native person, how *deeply painful* and insulting it is to pass off any kind of Christian/LDS/Catholic text as ""Native American."" It is not my history. It is *not* the story of our people, as much as your beliefs say otherwise. We have our own religions and creation myths and stories, and they're tribe-specific. Native Americans aren't a homogenous mass of people who all believed the same thing and worshipped the same gods or told the same stories or even spoke the same language. **Your religion is NOT the heritage of the Nakoda tribe**. 

As an additional layer of insult, you gave this text to a child, whose connection to his people is even more tenuous. In order to survive, our traditions *must* be passed down to the next generation. For me personally, passing down Mi'kmaq traditions and language will be difficult because they weren't passed down to me. I can imagine your coworker is probably in a similar situation. Her son likely doesn't have a solid grasp on what it means to be Nakoda, doesn't know his tribes' stories or language, at least not yet. Maybe Sarah wasn't even given the privilege of that kind of self knowledge. That can be a very alienating and terrible feeling, to know that you are connected to something that will forever remain out of your reach. 

And into that gap of knowledge, that lack of connection, you bumble your way inside, armed with only your religion and the sincere belief that you're doing the right thing and trying to help. You are *not* helping. You are *not* teaching this young boy what it means to be indjgenous, or giving him a deeper connection to his tribe or his land. Just by sending this boy home with this book, promising that it tells him more about his culture, you show how totally ignorant you are about native people and our beliefs. 

Believe whatever you want. Religion can be a very healing, wonderful, community building thing, and I'm glad your beliefs are so important to you. But *please* recognize that your beliefs are not universal and can be actively harmful to the people who are depicted in them. What it means to be LDS is not what it means to be Nakoda. 

You owe your friend Sarah and her son a very sincere apology, and you ought to take some serious time to reflect and do some research into indigenous people."

ddg585,NTA for being upset with your parents. No one likes double standards. Also its definitely worse because they aren't listening to why you are upset.
ddg6u0,"NTA. Your mothers comments are extremely inappropriate and uncalled for. She needs to be told, in no uncertain terms, that you’re no longer going to listen to her jabs about your weight."
ddg7pk,Yta. Crate training a dog isn’t unreasonable. Allowing a puppy to have free reign of an apartment isn’t safe for the puppy - there are too many things they could get into that could hurt them.

ddgeke,"""only to be told they needed a ""reason"" to quit and would not be taken off the schedule.""

You understand they can't come to your house and kidnap you and make you work, right? When they say they won't take you off the schedule, just smile, say ""good choice"" and don't show up. This is a really easy problem to solve. You literally don't even ever have to talk to them again from this point."
ddgmp9,NTA....are not little kids like dogs anyway? lol ...ur not in the wrong. At least ur not whooping asses or something. The parents need to loosen up
ddgmqu,Very obviously NTA. Where are you from that you need working papers by the way? Has the pizza place even said they’re only hiring one person? Many restaurants have multiple positions open often because they turn over workers quickly generally
ddgqa6,"I've read this a few times because I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something. I can be quite sensitive (29F) and I can't see a single part of that exchange that sounded condescending. I've only ever been to one concert, but I don't know anyone who knows all of the songs for all of the bands at any concert that they have been to. I thought that part of the excitement was being introduced to new artists.

That last paragraph got my back up though. She seems incredibly insecure if she needs to threaten you with validation from Reddit.  
If she wants validation, I suggest couple's counseling where she can express herself in a healthier manner.

Edited because I forgot to add NTA."

ddhgxg,"NTA. Just because she's your mother doesn't mean you owe her anything.

You didn’t want to sit by a stranger so you made someone else do it, lmao!"
ddhz6s,NAH. She lives there so to her it really is “hardly the middle of nowhere” in a way its her whole tiny world. Makes sense that her instinct would be to defend her community.

ddi2ge,"NTA 

Follow through on your threats. The fact that they think you’re overreacting and you’re here asking us shows you don’t follow though enough. “Don’t do X. If you do X I will do (list consequences)” and the moment they do it, follow through with every part of the consequences. If you realizes later you were being too harsh you can change your mind in private. Stop letting them push you around."

It's ALWAYS recommended to let them go at it while remaining calm and once they've simmered down, talk about what they want/need. Giving in to kids' explosive tantrums only reinforces the behavior, just like you said."
ddia5x,"Nta. The kid (depending on age) SHOULD KNOW, what he can and cant eat. or at least know to ask. also the parent should stick around if he is to young not to know himself, its her job not yours. especially with 35 fcking kids around. She should have brought something for him to eat.  thats neglect on her part."
ddiao6,NTA  Sorry to tell you this but Gabe isn't your friend.  If you were his friend he would stick up for you or sit with you at lunch since he knows you don't have anyone to sit with.
ddies3,"NTA. Firstly, if only ""more than half"" the pregnancy tests she's taken are positive, she probably needs to see a doctor and have it confirmed officially. They're [accurate 99% of the time,](https://www.glamour.com/story/how-many-pregnancy-tests-do-you-need-to-take) so if she's pregnant *almost all* of the tests she takes should be positive. 

But you're not TA because her mom thought you'd gotten her daughter pregnant, and it's fair to insist that your name is cleared, especially as it sounds like her mother was expecting you to be involved, which you obviously couldn't be.

I do think you need to step back from a friendship with this girl.

That being said, I think it sounds like you really want to go to this celebration.

You have absolutely no obligation to share your story with them until if and when you are ready."

ddifuc,ESH. You both sound insufferable.
ddiivk,YTA because you very plainly sacrificed your daughter's needs for your son's. You may have loved them both equally but you certainly didn't show your daughter that.

ddiwug,"YTA

She should have given you a tip! However, a tip though expected is not mandatory and you can never request a tip. And she even told you her reply and you almost argued with her. That is out of line from a professional point of view. 

The 45 minute drive as well as the gas money should be part of your salary and not come out of your own pocket. But this is between your employer and you - the customer has nothing to do with it.

ddj61j,"YTA. in a sense, you’re entitled to give how much you want to give but I don’t think it should be based on where the wedding is held - especially not for your own family members. How much they spend on their wedding should have no effect on how much you want to give."

ddjfx6,"Um. NTA. What the heck is wrong with your sister? Because this isn’t about “the family WII”. No one played it for years. If you really care about her feelings, sit down and talk to her calmly and rationally and ask her what the real issue is. I guarantee it isn’t about an old video game system. She may be harboring some issues in regards to the divorce and the Wii May have represented the good times your family had before the divorce. Let her know she will always have the memories and memories are not stuff but the experiences th at came when you guys were all together. Nothing can take that away from her."
ddjo0k,I use the mute option on my mom. You should try it.
ddjt13,"NAH. In my dictionary, ""pocket money"" is money you spend on yourself, not ""put it aside for college spending."" While that's the responsible idea, you're young and need to learn to save. It's a good lesson. Try to budget better so you can put money aside while still buying nice things."

Just because my roommate opens them doesn’t mean she is the only one who can close them.  I always close curtains before showering or taking off my clothes.   If I’m napping or something I throw on a bathrobe.    Every dwelling has windows, and all of them are see-through.  Are you asking her to close the curtains every time she leaves the home, regardless of the time?

It sounds like you had a reasonable and good conversation about this topic.

He wanted a monogamous relationship and he said that if the roles were reversed he wouldn't like you dancing like that with another man neither.

Yes, he can be a bit sad that he has lost some of the freedom he had before he decided that he wanted this relationship. But he has realised that what he has with you is more important. You don't stop him from enjoying life. He was the one who chose to live by the rules of a relationship. Sometimes those rules can be a bother but he knows it's what he really wanted. 

And it's true clubbing when being on the prowl for a  mate is very different from clubbing when you're married. It won't be the same. But it can still be fun. Maybe he'll just need some time to adjust to this new scenario."

Depending on what you wrote, you very well could be the A here if you sent out an inappropriate email because you were justifiably angry.  You can be right and still cross the line with how you handle it, and in the end that’s all that matters.

EDIT: YTA.   You lost all of the high ground once you hit send.  To be clear, I get it - people should act certain ways in a work environment, and cleaning up after oneself is basic.   The problem is, it’s like being the guy who hits reply-all to an accidental company wide email, demanding they be removed from the list.   

But I’ve written that email before...  it was cathartic to write that email.....  I just didn’t hit send,   Sometimes I sent it to my boss or office manager, and asked them to handle it.    Unfortunately, one co-worker chastising other coworkers publicly never come off well.    What sucks is you are right, and they are acting like Mommy is gong to clean up for them.

First I'm curious why she was in your room and leaving her things behind to begin with, and why it evolved into forcing you to coming to her pictures. As what, punishment? She presumably didn't seem to care until you drank her tea by mistake, so she's threatening to pull some petty shit over it? God, i don't miss being 14.

ddlj9x,"A very, VERY soft yta.

I remember thinking graduating and prom were huge deals, and at this stage in your life *they are* but as you age, the memories will fade a bit and you'll realize they were very minor occasions in the grand scheme of things. 

In your mom's defense, being miserable at your job is soul draining, and as much as it sucks right now to not have your mom around for these momentous occasions, try to understand that she'll feel like she's a better mom when she's happier. On top of that, timing is everything to finding the perfect job. It sucks that it happened now of all times, but you can't just wait and hope you'll find something that's equally as good, or hope that the job you want will still be available later. 

I hope your mom can make it to your events, congrats on your upcoming graduation :)"

If so, the best compromise is to have a save or set of characters that you only play when you're all together. James can play his Siren whenever he wants, but his Beastmaster is only for the Squad."

But don't ask how little this woman is receiving. Instead, talk about an agreement for the handling of shared expenses. Outline exactly what these expenses are, and ask if she'll be able to contribute her fair share. Be honest about how much of these resources you expect to consume, so you don't come across as wanting to ""pay half"" when you use 75%. These things can be tough to navigate with strangers, so look for signs of maturity and respect, above all, when choosing potential roommates."

My bff owns a gym and I hang out with him and plenty of personal trainers. They know how to be encouraging, inspirational, aspirational, etc. they would never just look at some numbers and be like “you’re overweight. Solidly overweight.” Even if that were true that’s not how a good trainer acts.

Your mother isn't even trying to apologise to you. She is not trying to mend the situation, or discuss why you left and how you can solve the issues together.

ddpbrj,"Not TA for not wanting to live with them. However,  practicalities also come into it. Who is on the lease? If just you, no problem (though you probably need to give some notice).

Now, I personally think people should have a sense of humor and able to laugh at themselves in today’s culture. But you just simply can’t expect that from people, if you’re saying something offensive and it’s not YOUR party, you should tone it down a bit out of respect. And the fact that it bothers you should be a clear indicator that he should stop (hence, why should tell him)."
ddpmfa,"NAH

You’re allowed to say no to side jobs. That’s why she asked you. Keyword asked. 

She’s allowed to value certain ambition levels or mindsets when it comes to work and what she’s looking for in a partner.

You said the relationship is still pretty new, it’s probably the first time that difference in work/life balance mindsets has come up. And it’s great that you both expressed it honesty how you felt. You’ll either accept that you view these things differently and build a great relationship with that in mind, or it may be a huge deal to her and then you weren’t going to be long term compatible anyway.

But kudos for you not trying to “impress” her and saying yes and opening the door to more invites for side work and resentment. And kudos to her for saying outright that was a difference between you two that concerned her so you guys could address it. Hooray for adults."

The blind ""always support your blood"" is what ends up destroying many families and your family constantly helping him out of his troubles means he will never improve himself because why would he need to if he always has a get out of jail card.

ddpskf,"YTA if you do it confrontationally, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea to just interject it jokingly. Everyone needs to take voting seriously because that’s the only way you have a voice.

Even in this post you talk about your kid visiting likes she's a friend or distant relative. 

You had a responsibility to her above and beyond anything else in this world. You don't get to just walk away from being a proper parent when you walk away from a marriage. To just put your new family first and not even try to accommodate her in some way was crazy. 

To not kick up a fuss the first summer you didn't get to spend time with her was crazy. 

To let this go on and on until she was 18 was crazy. 

To now say she's being malicious is crazy. 

Where have you shown this kid she's on an equal footing to your new life? I don't see a relationship here. Just some kid that comes to visit you occasionally."
ddr1gw,"NTA, go for it but first do some proper research.  Figure out where you’re gonna go precisely, living arrangements and what jobs you need or can land. Settlement money will eventually run out, so you’ll need a backup plan in place in case anything goes sideways with the money."

You threw clean laundry on the floor so she had to completely redo it without even mentioning it to your partner because you couldn't wait 10-20 minutes or however much longer they needed to dry? The point of you doing your own laundry is to take something off her hands, not make *more* work for her.

Also, you both work and she is at home taking care of your toddler all day while trying to do work and school, and you say ""she"" is falling behind in household stuff? So you do her the ""favor"" of doing your own laundry, even though you should be pulling your own weight anyway around the house? Good lord. Apologize to her and pick up more of the slack for your partner who is working, studying, and parenting what sounds like all the time."
ddrff5,"NTA.

Her issue is with the tenants not with you. reply as such and give her the name of the agency you let through to appear as helpful as possible.

ddrhf4,"NAH. You may want to talk to someone. Your feelings are not unwarranted or anything but they might turn into post partum depression following the pregnancy.

I don't think you're in the wrong or anything, I just think you might feel better if you talked out your feelings with someone, and you may get some advice on how to tell your husband how you're feeling, too.

>She basically said that I have to stop giving my parents money or she'd leave me,     

Ultimatums are manipulative- she is trying to control your money when you are not even living together.      
Lord knows how controlling she will get once you are.      

You get to decide how badly you want this woman in your life and what compromises you are willing to make.   
But attempting this amount of control is an enormous red flag if you ask me.  

You are a good son- don't let anyone make you feel guilty about that.   
$2k a month represents only around 8% of your income- if she is willing to walk over that then let her.  

If you marry her get a prenup- she is way too fixated on money for this stage in your relationship."

If you live in a safe area and all it’s totally fine to have him walk home on his own *if he is comfortable doing so*. You should have talked to him about this. Going on a walk and forgetting the time and forgetting to pick up your kid is an asshole move. You could have made a call to whoever was watching him at the pool, be that a class instructor or a neighbour keeping an eye out, or a lifeguard who was cool keeping an eye on an otherwise unsupervised kid. Instead you left an 11 year old alone, made him worry not knowing where you were, made him feel completely neglected and forgotten about, and it sounds like this is the first time he ever walked home from there on his own. Probably not knowing if he was in for trouble doing that on his own or not."

dduczo,"NTA. I took care of my mom for a few months when she was first diagnosed with stage 4, metastatic cancer. I’ve never been more physically and emotionally exhausted, or felt more alone, in my life. Know how many people I snapped at or engaged in arguments with? None. One has nothing to do with the other. I didn’t suddenly become prone to arguments and demanding answers to a series of questions when I’ve already been told we should take a break because the conversation is getting out of control. 

I can definitely empathize with what she’s going through. But that doesn’t excuse lashing out like this versus simply saying “that comment earlier was pretty thoughtless, and hurt my feelings”. 

Does she deserve a little extra understanding during a difficult time? Sure. But that doesn’t excuse this prolonged outburst."
dduezs,NTA - it’s shitty of him to ask you to dress up for a movie date. You’re sitting in the dark eating popcorn. Shorts and a t are standard clothing for that.
ddugdd,"NTA that's too excessive. Don't let her use your dryer and laundry anymore, unless its a big load. Tell her to go use the laundry mat like she said."
dduhcb,NTA. Rent is not maid service and any civilized  child let alone adult doesn’t owe on a seat.
ddulyn,"?? Are you being serious? I'm getting that you obviously don't see this as a big deal, but YTA as far as I'm concerned, no doubt. Picking up people's food for them does not give you a right to a portion of their food. That line of thinking is weird.

If you didn't pay for the food, you aren't entitled to any of the food. If you feel entitled to some kind of compensation for driving people their food, then ask for gas money. Stop stealing food from your friends."
dduos4,"YTA it really could be that this was always his personality but he was just downplaying and ""acting straight"" around you when he was in the closet. Same thing happened to a buddy of mine.

Until he came out of the closet two years later he is living life as a female"
dduq4e,"NTA this girl sucks and is temporary. Hang in there, it'll be a funny story about clingers once your friend can recognise all these red flags and cut it off"
dduq9i,"NAH. I don’t think you’re an asshole for needing some space from her. I can empathize moving back to parents after you have been on your own - it SUCKS. I lasted not even two weeks. She crossed a boundary, but I don’t think it was of a place of malice. While you have been the one through hell and back with your treatments and recovery, it also worried your mom to death. She shouldn’t have gone behind your back about it for sure. However, I will say this. Life is too short. My husband has about 2 years give or take to live from his Neuroendocrine cancer diagnosis. One thing I learned was not to waste one second being angry and not speaking, and to resolve problems and move on. I wish you the best in your health, cancer is a bitch, man."

ddv6m4,NTA. I’m sorry but if my husband was taking pictures lying down with girls with heart emojis then heads would roll. This isn’t acceptable behavior for someone in a committed relationship.

If he won’t then he isn’t marriage material IMHO.
ddv87a,"NTA

it seems like you've given leftovers to homeless people plenty times before.  I see many people going though trash just to find something edible, maybe one of the saddest things I've seen was a guy collecting coffee from thrown to go cups in a plastic bag. It has much more dignity to receive something knowing just one person used it rather than digging said water bottle or similar from the trash. If you live in the EU, even if the homeless person wouldn't want the water, it could make use of it due to the 'Pfand' system. So even less shame in that.
Some of the arguments of that person are valid, like spreading disease, but when you give your stiff away you know of you're sick or not, and you know your intentions are well and don't think of them as lesser for giving them your leftovers. Don't get discouraged because of that douche. 

 If the homeless person accepts it, it's okay. if they're uncomfortable they can still throw it away but the best thing is that THEY decide if it's thrown or not. Sadly deciding:'do I want this sandwich or no', 'will I drink this water or no' is not a privilege all of them have. Giving them leftovers, is giving them the option to choose! All support counts for most of them, if they don't have to spend that money they have on water or food, it's only good for them."

Sure condoms aren’t perfect, but my gut says she may be doing this to hit you up for money.

How is him pouting all day ever going to convince you that having sex with him is a good idea, when he acts like that when you turn him down? 

My husband use to pull this morning shit. I called it the poke poke. I fucking lost it on him one morning. I explained it to him like this: I could wake up in the middle of the night hungry. You are sound asleep. You make the best grilled cheese sandwiches ever and that is what I want. Am I going to wake you up to make me one? I mean, there is a chance that you may be hungry as well. We both had an early supper. But I'm not going to make me being hungry for your grilled cheese your problem when you are sound asleep. I will go make my own grilled cheese. Because I know you want to sleep, even though you also enjoy grilled cheese. I'm sure as shit not going to try and wake you up, ask you to make me a grilled cheese, then be pissed you won't, be a grumpy asshole for the rest of the day, then ask for grilled cheese for supper the next day.

ddwstd,"NAH Anxiety can be really hard to deal with and you shouldn’t feel like you need to meet up with people if you’re not up to it. However, friendship is a two-way street and you sometimes have to work to keep it going. You don’t have to hang out if you don’t want to but you also need to be prepared for your friends to move on eventually if you continue to give nothing back to them. I’d suggest letting them know how you feel so that they at least know why you’ve been distant for a while."

ddwzih,"YTA, but mostly for how you reacted when she got upset. You think it's ridiculous for her to mad about fries, but not for you to be mad. No one likes to be told ""get the hell over it, are you really that upset."" Yes she's upset; you treated her like a child instead of a partner who you respect. I'm not saying it was okay for her to take your food, but if you didn't say something along the lines of ""it really bothers me when you do that and I know you don't want a whole meal but at least order a side if you want to pick,"" then that came out of nowhere for her. Be an adult and communicate."
ddx0d6,NAH. They don't care what your next ride is. They booked you and they want the service.

ddxbyg,NTA but you may need to take the downgrade option unfortunately because it sounds like there isn't anything you can do.
ddxjv7,NTA- he gave it to you as a gift! I find it weird he would ask for it back
ddxlgc,"NTA

You’re just trying to help but I feel as if your aren’t taking your *own* mental health into consideration here. It sounds like watching your girlfriend go through this is stressful, which is completely understandable.

>I’m afraid that she will break up with me, and I know that this won’t be good for her

If she breaks up with you it’s because she decides that she’s not in the best state to be in a relationship right now, not really because of a conversation you had with her brother. That’s if she’s being reasonable."
ddxmqi,"NTA.  I’m sorry your parents have put you in this position.

In the future, could you refuse to do anything with them?  As your parents said, you’re not the parent, so don’t even try to make them act like basic humans and just go about your own business?"
ddxn24,"YTA, at 25 they cover all of your essential expenses ( food, water, clothing, scientifically backed healthcare, etc. ) and your first response is to become petulant and angry at them for not shelling out more money so you can have spa days. Like, I can't speak for surgeries at their toll on health and well-being, but this is almost comical; you aren't a child and you aren't entitled to more from them, they have done everything they can for you thus far and you need to grow up."
ddxneo,"NTA, you don't have to tell them anything you don't want to. I don't really think it would have made a difference if you had told them everything. They care more about making this about them. You are an adult and you can make your own decisions, including not seeing them/talking to them if that's what's best for you and your DH and child."
ddxote,[deleted]
ddxwlw,"ESH. It sucks when parents can only talk about their babies in the company of friends with no babies. But I also think it's a little weird that you say ""Aw, Kimmy does that as well!"" when Kimmy is *a dog.* 

Wanting to talk about your dog? Not a problem. But you're literally comparing your dog to human babies, which is going to make for pretty awkward conversation."
ddxwwz,"NTA. According to the post, you have good reason to suspect they aren’t on top of planning everything. Getting upset because you are trying to double-check about your special day would be a bit childish of your family, who probably recognize that they aren’t the best at planning."
ddxxj5,"NTA 

17 year olds aren't going to cry or randomly scream or fidget. Which is why they had that rule"
ddxxk9,"NAH - this just sounds like a bunch of people being silly high schoolers.. Brian shouldn't have shocked Katy with that question, and the whole school shouldn't have thought that she was a b-word... Sure you could've told him, but maybe he would've gotten mad at you or something worse... It's just not worth playing the game of ""I could've done better"". I'm shocked that you still care about this 9 years later when you were barely involved."
ddy1xu,NTA. She's just trying to use your mom and your mother can't see that.
ddy6v6,Who pays $2 for a pizza slice at a party
ddy7wl,"NTA. You specifically told him you didnt want the cupcake with bug on it, and he did the opposite of that and put the bug on your cupcake and not his or his friends. Of course it was just an ant but I totally see why you wouldnt want that on your cupcake especially when pregnant and barely able to keep food down in the first place that DIDNT already have bugs on it. How did he expect you to even want to eat that? 
Definitely NTA"
ddye91,NTA. You are entitled to taking your property home with you.
ddyfkg,NTA he sounds exhausting. I would suggest just writing him off as a lost cause.
ddygei,"Oh jeez. I am constantly annoyed with people asking trivial questions on this subreddit, then something like this comes up and I wish it was someone asking if they'd be the asshole if they stole their sister's hamster.

NTA but please at least leave yourself open to the possibility that your parents will be supportive. Do what you need to do to protect yourself but try to leave them the option to do the right thing.

Good luck."
ddyhgj,ESH. Why are you making your relationship a competition?
ddyke0,"NTA. He broke up with Cindy and in doing so, nothing she does is any of his business anymore. You aren’t obligated to keep tabs on his ex and report back to him."
ddym8a,NTA but your boyfriend is big asshole.
ddyrel,"NTA, it's not like you did anything bad to make the kid cry. Probably just not used to adults being firm."
ddyste,ESH Jesus everyone acted like immature idiots in this situation. Why can’t  you guys just do your own grocery shopping individually? Why do you have to go together?
ddyuzw,NTA - wtf you literally got them what they asked for
ddyx0u,"Wait...when its hot out, raising the temp on the ac will lower the electric bill"
ddyx8f,"Just sleep in the bed, let him sleep on the couch. No need to be annoyed

Edit: spelling"
ddyyq1,NAH- I think was you said was pretty passive aggressive but I don’t think your the asshole. The bathroom is really disgusting. I think you should just clean when you see something dirty and have a cleaning schedule so it doesn’t become petty and you guys aren’t not cleaning because it’s “not your mess”. It’s just shit you have to deal with when you live with other people. You don’t have to be like “hey clean after yourself” unless you know for a fact that person did that because you have other roommates that have access to that bathroom. You could have just put a group text out saying hey just a reminder to please clean up after yourself. So you don’t acuse one person in particular especially since you don’t know for sure who did it.
ddyzsv,"NAH I really don’t like the “only kids in the wedding party” idea. Either kids are allowed or they aren’t. That’s a bad idea from the get go. If they still come to the wedding, the kid is going to be there, guaranteed. Why make an issue of it and cause more stress on your big day? Let it go."
ddz0mm,"NTA, but try not to have personal biases interfere when including it in the book."
ddz80p,NTA. He is the asshole here. Taking your vehicle without asking or even telling you? Not returning it when asked? Using a different vehicle despite the fact that he has his own? NOPE! Go get the truck and hide the keys from him from now on.
ddzaxz,"100% NTA. You were incredibly clear that the gift was based on the decision to go to college. Now, what you could do is let him know that if down the road he decides to attend college, you would go ahead and buy him an updated laptop at that time. Otherwise, it's your money and no one can force you to do anything with it. Them being upset about it, and especially him feeling like he can speak to you that way, makes me feel like he was raised with participation trophies. He made a decision and there are consequences. His life and career could still work out very well but it will happen without the going-to-college gift."
ddzbeb,"YTA

The only thing Max is asking for is a warning and you’re giving him a hard time about it. The same way Max could text you and say “hey kick them out please” you could text Max and say “hey I’m bringing people over.” If you already know Max is the type to be emotional why make things worse for him when it’s such a simple fix?

Edit: a word"
ddzdhb,"YTA, by your own admission she’s like this with your straight siblings. That means she’s not being homophobic just a fussy parent. 

Also if you only came out a couple of months ago you have to give family members time to get used to it. While they might say they’re happy for you and accept you it takes a while for some people to get used to it."
ddzez8,"I think I'll go tentatively NAH.

You're not an asshole because, while everyone is different on the introvert-extavery scale, everyone still needs some alone time to decompress and reset. Perhaps you're just a person who needs a little more. There is nothing wrong with that so long as you communicate that with him. If done properly and he is still upset, perhaps this relationship isn't meant to be.

He is not an asshole because, while he is responsible with finding housing that fits his needs (i.e. power staying on), it is 2019 and I guess us as human beings are spoiled and have grown entitled to the luxury known as electricity. As a boyfriend he most certainly has the right to ask you if he could stay with you.

I think that maybe starting a dialogue regarding how much space you each need would be healthy. But clearly communicate that you so indeed like him and like where this is headed, but that staying over so much is too much too quickly. And then continue and demonstrate this by being a good SO and let this grow the relationship rather than being a roadblock in it. I know that it is easier said than done but best of luck."
ddzme2,"NTA. She will never change when everybody always take her bullshit and except her apology. Show her that you are not her ""i forgive you puppy"" and let her run into a wall."
ddzmr0,Whoosh.
ddzsrv,Nta. She could have come over and introduced herself and asked nicely to hold your child. You can't just grab someone's kid and expect them to be OK with it. Old ladies are weird.
ddzuu3,"ESH you can't run her life and you are hardly ever there anyway so you can't expect her to get permission for everything, it's her home too that she is paying for. Would you like it if she said something about your boyfriend being there? However I do agree that she could have at least told you he was staying and introduced you considering there's a chance you'd walk into your own home and bump into a strange man there.

I kind of have to wonder though considering you are almost never there why even take in a roommate instead of just moving in with the boyfriend that you stay with most of the time anyway, also does he have a roommate and has he cleared it with his roommate that you stay with him so often?"
ddzwex,"NTA

Your parents let a medication you need run out, then held you accountable for the withdrawals, and then for the effects of them punishing your withdrawals.

Just missing the medication refill is probably either neglect or an honest mistake on your parents' part.  Punishing you for experiencing related symptoms crosses the line into emotional abuse."
ddzwux,"NAH. You don't have to ""make a fuss about it,"" or ""put your foot down."" Just tell her, in a calm, non-confrontational manner, that you can't afford to buy a BHLDN dress. It's possible she'll volunteer to cover part or all of the cost. If she doesn't, that's you cue to say - still calmly and non-confrontationally - that unfortunately you won't be able to be a bridesmaid, but you'll be their as a guest, and you hope she has a happy wedding day."
ddzxjb,"Yeah, YTA. Just be upfront about what kind of friends you have and what parties you go to? You won’t let her make her own choice about whether she would want to go or not. You’ve been dating for almost a year, most people would want to introduce their girlfriend to their friends, surely, unless they think it’ll expose you as a cool drug takin’ mad lad or whatever. I get wanting time to yourself hanging with your friends in a relationship, but you’re being disingenuous IMO."
de02id,"YTA - You got caught trashing someone and you think you don't owe her an apology? Doesn't matter how you got caught, it matters that she got hurt."
de0404,"YTA

Why exactly does it have anything to do with you?  Because you had a crush on her and did absolutely nothing for years?

She was right when she told you to grow up. 

It reads like you think you are somehow entitled to her because you liked her first which is  very much a young child's attitude.  My toy I saw it first waa waa MUMMMMEEEEEE ITS NOT FAIR

Even if you had asked her out she may not have been interested in you.
A woman isn't first come first served.

you owe them both an apology tbh"
de05y6,"NTA, but consider the bigger picture. Is this a one off? If you decide to complain, go through the council not through the neighbours!"
de08us,"how’s this kid so brilliant if he’s failing the exams? NTA he was clearly not mature enough to be there but then, what’s up with his likely old enough parents that they think teachers should be sued if the child is not ready."
de09k0,"NTA. Frankly I think letting him come visit you because he ""already had train tickets"" was pretty weird. It's not ""mean"" to avoid someone you just broke up with, and it certainly isn't weird to start enforcing some boundaries now."
de0ayo,"NAH.

I'm guessing you guys are pretty young, I haven't really heard of ""monthly anniversaries"" since teenage years or maybe early 20s at latest.

You mention anniversaries being annual which is spot on, derived from ""annus"" (year) and ""versus"" (turned). Basically ""turned yearly"".

Maybe try to reframe this as a ""monthly date night"" to keep you both happy while keeping the actual anniversary a more special occasion, chances are she's just holding onto this idea as a way to regularly have something to look forward to for you as a couple."
de0ipm,YTA- lmao thr fact that u are threatened by the idea of a girl doing a better job than you... get over yourself
de0kr0,"YTA. You tried to kiss her, she wasn't interested. You publicly posted that you were lesbians, she's not a lesbian, and clearly doesn't want to be in a relationship with you. You say ""Michelle also ignored me, forcing me to gaze from afar."" Nobody was *forcing you to gaze at a woman who rejected you.* And it does sound like you were taking pictures of her. Step back.

>The last thing she said was that I leave her alone forever.
If I could, I would have clarified that I admired her...

Do not do that. Leave her alone."
de0lfy,"NTA but keep in mind depending on the strength of feelings he has for this girl, saying this may hurt your friendship more than it hurts theirs."
de0liw,"Not Enough Info — why does she hate dream catchers so much? Is it just dream catchers or does she make you take down other posters / decorations? 

Instead of being like “well I really like them,” try asking her why she doesn’t like them and empathize with her. If she has a really dumb response like “because I said so,” then I’m sorry that your mother is acting like that. :("
de0rdv,"YTA. You could have gone to the bathroom instead of making your coworkers sit in a fart cloud. That's disgusting.

It's one thing for a fart to slip out by accident, but in most cases you can hold it in till you're by yourself."
de0rgk,NTA but you are giving up a golden opportunity to just date the brother and mindfuck this dude and play out a little Edmond Dantes fantasy
de0vsn,"NTA, it's not okay she's breaking the agreement especially not if that means strange people in your sleeping area without you knowing of it. This is genuinely how people get their ass shot."
de197j,"I don't think either choice, talking to them or not, would make you an asshole, so NTA. It's a difficult situation you find yourself in and neither answer is really right or wrong, it is merely a choice you have to make. Do you confront him, and tell her, potentially causing her to break down further and him leave, or do you pretend nothing is wrong and let him go on in his philanderous ways for the sake of the sanity of everyone involved? Difficult to say. No right answers here."
de1ar9,"NTA. It could be a cultural thing where family means you have to bend over and let them treat you however they want, but not playing that game doesn't make you an ahole. If you're not close with these people, there's no reason you need to go to their parties. It'd be nice if you acknowledged the invite and sent a card or gift if you can afford it. Understand that if you don't, you're making a pretty big, possibly irreversible, statement. But that's your right."
de1iw9,"YTA, because the stuffed toy isn't the issue here. Either forgive her and move on, or accept that you can't forgive her and break up."
de1vai,"I didn’t say you should be over him, just that you can’t sit in your shared home and demand that they sit in mourning with you.

Yes, I have had a breakup. They suck. Take a class, take up running, join a meet up group, seek counseling (group or individual)."
de1y5n,"NTA. Report him. Even if he doesn't act on it ( but there's a strong chance he will) chatting shit like that is going to make people very uncomfortable and angry. It's normalising sexual assault and misogyny. He might have ideas and attitudes from the 16th century, and he can have them, but he's living in a community now and needs to learn to be polite, respectful and not an asshole. 
Someone needs to remind him this is 2019 and no-one wants to hear this crap, and that if he acts on it, he's a worthless, disgusting creep that isn't fit to be around decent people."
de1yl0,"This actually isn’t a mom problem; it’s a period problem and that can be fixed a lot easier than an unsympathetic mother can. Go to your doctor and get on medication to stop your awful periods. You can take the pill all the time (skipping the placebos) and never get your period. Also, get checked for PCOS and endometriosis because it’s really not normal to have periods like that. NTA"
de22bk,"NAH. You can dress how you like, but if they feel embarrassed to hang out with you they aren’t assholes for that. You should find friends that share or at least dont mind your passion if it’s so important for you."
de27jo, if hes really that mean cut him out he doesn't need to be apart of your friend group. There's not much point in confronting him about his attitude because it sounds like you guy already have I. The pass and he hasn't changed.
de2eaz,"NAH - I know it’s a very awkward and weird situation, but at the end of the day I think everyone is an adult here and they’re entitled to be friends with who they want to be friends with. I think it’s a little rude of your mom to not at least invite you but since she’s lonely and needs some friends I think it’s just the fact that she needs someone with some common interests to do stuff with"
de2l52,"ESH You’re TA for inserting yourself in family drama.  He’s obviously TA for not asking her first. And finally, your grandmother has had 80 years to learn how to stick up for herself.

de2non,NTA but I’d say the relationship is probably not heading anywhere if neither of you end up compromising.
de2o8l,"NTA, if you won the prize for modeling, you won the money yourself. She doesnt have any right to ask for it."
de2qdh,"NAH She’s within her rights to ask, but it’s perfectly ok for you to say no. But I’m really curious, why would you say no? You mention it would be a burden... but you’d be happy to do it if you weren’t a back up... is this more to do with you feeling left out and like a second choice?"
de2qk1,"YTA, I think you went too far to what... make a point or something? Just tell him you're not interested in going for coffee with him. The farce with the ""if you still have my number..."" thing is the asshole part."

de38ub,"NTA. I suspect that your ""friend"" is really miffed about something else, but has chosen to focus on your drummer's age. That, of course, is idiotic. You need to find out what's going on in your friend's head, or tell him/her to shut their cakehole."
de38xa,NTA. Imagine a grown woman making a 5 year old feel guilty about receiving a present.
de39to,"NTA, never engage with someone that’s got road rage. There’s no point. They aren’t there to have a debate they just want to vent anger and there’s nothing productive about that for you."
de3bum,"NTA your friend wanted to go to the park, how did she think she was gona get there. They also used two shitty excuses back to back, not seeing you does not alter the ticket price, also her fault for not seeing you much as she gave up so easily to get food."
de3c1b,"YTA. The whole bug up the ass Reddit has about ""my house/car my rules"" doesn't work in the real world. Why wouldn't you want all of your friends to have a great time with you? Why stomp your feet and dig them into the group so hard instead of just saying ""Yeah sure, this isn't for everyone"" and going with it?

You just seem like a selfish friend. I'd probably avoid you."
de3if6,"I'm going to say NAH but I do think you'd be better off if you tagged along a few times. It's not like he's asking you to join the beer league.

de3qt5,"NTA. As long as you approach the housing director (or whoever is in office) in a way that explains you aren’t 100%. In case you are wrong about the situation. My dorms would sometimes spill over onto another floor for just like one room or two if there were uneven numbers. Like, don’t be an accusatory jerk, just raise the question. If it is a squatter, it isn’t fair to the people who live there. I’m a female, but even I know how much more of an outrage this would be if some older dude was squatting on a girls floor."
de3ufr,"NAH - Except SeaWorld

Just tell her honestly how you feel about SeaWorld and then try to hang out with them before/after."
de3uxt,"> my husband is an amazing father to our girls

No. He isn’t. A parent who treats their spouse like this sets a gross example for their children. He will be actively teaching your daughters that the way he treats you is how they should expect to be treated. Your daughters will learn that it’s okay for a man to try to change them, to belittle them, to compare them to other people, to put them down, to go behind their backs, to disrespect them. That is not a good father. And if you let him keep doing this, you will tell them this is okay."
de3xvz,"NTA, many people do this exact thing. some events just aren’t for children. they knew they’d be having one i assume?!  seems like they’re just trying to get attention. not their day though."
de4044,"NTA.  Here is the thing:. You are not responsible for your Dad.  Not for how he treated you nor how he treats others.

My guess, based on the little you have shared, is that he is a charming sociopath.  And any warning you would give to a stranger would likely go unheeded.  Your dad will explain it away -- it is a stalker or estranged business partner, making up shit.

And realize that contacting the new gf involved you back in his life.

Would it be ok to notify her?  Sure, but not the caveated above.  The thing to ask:. Will you be ok with yourself not notifying her?"
de47au,"First of all, please tell me you reported the driver in that one incident. That's super fucked up.

She said it was up to me to judge my dad based on his interactions with me and it wasn't her place to shit talk based on her interactions with him. Then I finally moved in with my dad around 13 and he shit tall my mom which made me lose a lot of respect for him and eventually I told him to stfu and she never said one bad thing about him."
de4te5,"NTA, she has valid reasons for marrying Daniel. She thinks he will be a good husband and father. She has a minor crush on a coworker, that’s not a reason to wreck a relationship."
de4wgr,"NAH. 

Ultimately you get to decide who stays in your life. 

But you also need to understand that you’re 18. You’re old enough to *take care of yourself*. You’re familiar with periods, and unless they are just crazy irregular you should know when they are going to happen. A sun burn isn’t a crazy medical emergency, even though it make suck. And it would have annoyed me also all the whining you mentioned here. 

Your step mom sounds horrible. Talk to your dad about this and mention calmly how disrespected you felt that she could talk to you so harshly."
de53h6,"NAH, but buying all the tickets for the group and you knew not everyone would be able to go was a bad decision. 

If they initially said they’d go, and pay for the tickets, and now dropped out then yes, they should reimburse you for their cost. But if they don’t, consider it the price of a lesson learned that you never should have paid for anyone’s ticket but your own."

de57qh,"So you wanted mayo on your burger. They had mayo at the table. You didn't want that mayo though.

The bottom line is this: the mother is the boss. she has the ability to say “hey please don’t add my son guys” and stop tagging OP in her posts where her employees can see it. it’s inappropriate. As long as the mom goes about it tactfully and with reason, there’s no reason why anyone would be butthurt. It’s a parents job to protect their kids and make sure they’re comfortable. NTA."

You're in a weird spot because you feel partial ownership over the flat. These things happen when you have partial ownership over things. It sounds to me like you're trying your best to satisfy all parties, which is probably the right move, and it's what I (another genuine human) would probably do. However, in the future, you might wanna think about involving mom in less things, and/or letting her assert less control over your decisions. It sounds like that will provide a much needed rock upon which you can put your foot down.

Help Anna find a new flat, explain to mom that you aren't and probably shouldn't be in the property management business, because you let another human accidentally live in a roach infested zoo, and then tell her (your mom) that you love her, and ask her to take the apartment back and give you the equity you put in (the place sounds like a dump tbh, sorry).

Make no mistake — they likely won’t consider you a friend after you do this.  And it won’t be because they’re transphobic, it’ll be because you didn’t value their friendships enough to bother maintaining them.  

Instead, I suggest you send them a heartfelt message to tell them what’s up, or meet them for coffee and explain it to them in person.  They’ll either understand why you need to take some time, or they may surprise you with their support.  Lots of cis people don’t really understand and haven’t bothered to consider what it’s like to transition, and in all likelihood they have no fucking idea what you’d like from them in terms of support and social behavior or whatever.  Just tell them.  

...But, I get it, you have other shit to worry about right now and maybe you just want one less thing to deal with.  I can totally empathize with the desire to just socially drop off the face of the earth for a little while.

She’s probably going to break up with you and feels stupid for wasting her time and money on someone who is too cowardly to even make your long distance relationship real.

Your edit says SHE doesn’t want to drive that long. So you refuse to visit her in return it seems. I hope she breaks up with you. You’re way too old to be pulling this lazy little boy behavior.

This comment below you posted astounds me. 

“I can manage LD relationships just fine. Before her I was in a one year LD relationship (we never met in person, but she lived all the way in Canada) and my ex-girlfriend didn't complain.”

You absolutely don’t care to put in much effort in any relationship. You NEVER even met your ex. My bf is American and I’m Canadian and we both visit each other and it’s a joint effort. Been doing it for 5 years and starting immigration paper work now. “All the way in Canada” my ass. New gf is only one state over and you still can’t put in much effort because it inconveniences you to tell your family or travel to her. 🙄

Annnd she broke up with you and you mention it’s her first relationship to deflect. I think she gave it a chance by visiting you. You hiding her away and not staying with her and asking her to visit again on her own dome is just cruel. Learn empathy and consideration especially for a supposed loved one."

First, whether or not you want to believe it... you are taking her for granted. You guys have been dating a long time and you both love each other. It is understandable that some part of you feels like she'll definitely be around, but truth is, love just isn't enough to keep two people together. 

> not too far apart 

Second, ~~you literally only saw her once last year and you both don't even live that far away???~~ Shit dude, please buck up your game!!! How much is ""not too far apart""?

ETA: I misread, you only visited her once. Either way, I still feel you guys should meet more or go out or do something!


> she casually mentioned coming to visit me, because she has more free time, but I dont think I really want her to visit because then I’ll have to entertain her and I wont have enough time to study. 

> I don't want to do that, I just want to go home and relax

I think the most worrying aspect of these is that her coming to meet you/you meeting her doesn't give you a sense of gratitude or excitement, but that you describe it as a chore or some additional work you have to do... You don't want to go on vacations with her 

> Its not that, I just dont always know how busy I’ll be.

You're blowing off your girlfriend because you POTENTIALLY might be busy? Do you see how problematic that sounds? 

She doesn't need someone who is too busy for her but someone who would prioritise her over all this business. 

>Its not my fault I dont know when I’m going to be free.

It's a relationship, dude, MAKE TIME. Everyone in serious relationships doesn't have free time. They MAKE free time for their partners because they want to spend time together.

> plan stuff for our anniversary, stuff for christmas, stuff for birthdays.

You guys are in long distance and don't do this already? I get that some people treat their anniversaries as NBD but guys, come on, you both are young and aren't at that stage where anniversaries are just another number of the years you've spent together.

Can you tell him one on one that his threat to get custody is hurting you and talk it over with him? Also did he tell you about the drug testing and custody issues or did you find out from your mom?

dembgk,"ESH. 

She clearly wasn’t “perfectly fine” with you paying the tab, because she *left*. 

 I can understand why.  I don’t know anything about Cindy besides what you told us, but in my life, I’m the “ugly duckling”. 

( I have developed a terminal illness that seriously ravaged my looks- my hair fell out, I need to be on oxygen and wear a mask, I became partially paralyzed and need a wheelchair, and I take high doses of steroids so I’ve gained a ton of weight and 3 chins.). I don’t have the energy or ability to do my makeup, wear contacts, can’t wear cute shoes, can’t try on clothes.  I tell you this, not for sympathy, but so people don’t respond telling me “just hot yourself up/just lose weight!”. 

The way I was treated as a “pretty girl” before I got sick and the way I’m treated now are total opposites. I used to be the girl that would get into the clubs for free, and couldn’t go out without making friends and getting numbers and drinks from people.

Now I am treated like garbage.  Not just because people don’t give me free stuff, I can live with that, even though it’s a disheartening signal that I am not what people want, to constantly see other women get “prizes” for essentially, existing and looking good doing it. I understand I am not entitled to those free things. I just wish people thought I was still “worth it”,  now that I look “different”.

It goes so much farther. People are actually cruel, in the things they say and the way they interact with me. I could write for an hour about my experiences as “sick Sage”, but it wouldn’t be relevant. I have a point, I’m just long winded!

Sometimes it gets to be too much. I have to leave wherever I am, go home, and have a cry, because I feel so worthless and so...alien and ugly.  I want to crawl out of my skin and into someone else’s SO badly. 

I think Cindy may have self esteem issues that caused her to feel that way, too.

When the younger (and likely, to society, “prettier”) girls got in for free, that triggered something in Cindy that made her feel inferior to them.

She didn’t want YOU to pay - she wanted to be treated equally to those pretty young things, and to feel like she was just as good as they are, and worth just as much.

When you didn’t have her back, it was like reinforcing that the bouncer was right- they deserved to go for free, Cindy deserved to have to pay.  She wanted you to stand up for her.

In the end, it wasn’t your fault that it happened and I see both points of view. It would have been great for Cindy to suck it up and not make a scene, and just let everyone have their fun.

At the same time, if she left alone in tears, this may have been her limit.  You don’t know what her life experiences have been like, to get to this point.

She could have been more accepting of the situation. You could have been much kinder and more compassionate.

ESH but Cindy, the least.  Humans have feelings and sometimes they are overwhelming. When that happens - and/or when we feel wronged by others - we hope our friends will be there to support our struggle. 

It sounds like you were so caught up in wanting to have a good time at the club, you didn’t really care the way you should have, that Cindy was hurting.

I’m sure I’ll get downvoted for this, people will want to call Cindy an “entitled Karen” or something- but in reality, she is no less entitled than your pretty friends who got in for free. She should have gotten equal treatment.  

(I also blame the bouncer- even if you’re trying to fill your club with hotties, you don’t break up a group to do it!  Even if it was just a “so you’re not excluded”, there’s no reason he couldn’t have let Cindy in as well.)

I see no reason all of you, couldn’t have pointed that out...besides being more concerned with having a good time, than Cindy’s feelings."

You certainly don't have to go to every party, but being in a relationship means sometimes doing things you wouldn't choose for yourself.

I get his point of view. I’m a dog lover but I’ll be damned if a dog comes into my bed and sleeps with me. For one, I have a massive pet peeve about people smacking or licking their lips loudly and it goes for dogs too...and they all always make that irritating noise!!! I hate it!!

deoifi,"NTA at all, your parents are TA and your brother a soft TA. It’s like you said: you’re their daughter, putting you in the middle is unhealthy to everyone. You’re also not your mom’s friend. It sucks that she has no friends but tbh that’s her responsibility to deal with.

They could be upset with **her**. They might have a specific reason why they don't want her to go that doesn't include money, but you couldn't have known that. She expressed a need, you helped her with a solution. If they're not willing to share with their (almost adult) daughter why they are not ok with her going on this trip besides money, that's an internal problem, not a reason to be upset with you. Did the ""father with words"" explain why they're unhappy about what happened?"

depeh4,NTA. Find a new gf though dude. This ones not who you hoped she would be.
depg98,NAH. Seems like they just wanted to do the project their way and we’re fine with basically having a “freeloader” which is someone who gets a free ride without doing any work. I would just be grateful because you even asked if they wanted help and they said it’s okay so if anything does happen with you being accused of doing no work just tell them you asked them if they needed help.
depivs,"NTA—I’m in Human Resources so I have a lot of experience with employee turnover and it’s totally normal. You didn’t do anything disrespectful and no normal boss would expect you to turn down a viable job offer because of their personal vacation. You did what’s best for you, they’ll hire someone new it happens all the time.

depwqk,"ESH. You less than tho. You're bringing up ""some bad history of gay people"" to get a rise from her and shes being in your face with her sexuality. From another LGBTQ person, its an unwinnable battle. But call her out when she uses F\*\*\*\*T. Thats a term for male homosexuals, not all sexualities and genders.

Good luck bud."
deq0a8,"Sounds like you're gatekeeping to me.

YTA."
deq0fu,"NTA - Your aunt is a grown ass woman; you're not obligated to help her with her finances.

My suggestion would be to get a sense of her willingness to cut expenses and make responsible financial decisions. If she really wants to chance, then help her. If her expectation is for you to make money magically appear for her, then tell her you're not going to help since you're not a magician."

deqb9i,"YTA

That's fucking gross dude.  And it's a single fucking tupperware.  Just throw it out and buy more if you need to.  Your wife is pissed about 2 things now, that her daughter was eating food out of a container that once held dead rat bones, and that her husband doesn't listen to her and has zero regard for what she has to say."
deqbjf,"NAH. I hear your friend, but I think that explanation is a bit of a stretch. As someone who will always try to give someone a heads up to fixable problems (food in teeth, tag showing, etc) I wouldn’t take the woman’s reaction to heart. She was probably just embarrassed.

Small fix that *may* have made it better: just say your underwear/pants are showing instead of “your thong.”"

deqta7,"NTA, If ive got this right, Your Mother and Aunt planned a 10 day trip for you without consulting you? 

Who is paying for it is irrelevant. Expecting an adult to drop everything they may have planned for 10 days to go anywhere without being consulted beforehand is an asshole move. Sounds more like they are treating you like a real child and just expecting you to do what they want you to do.

You mentioned that your fine seeing them for a weekend. Maybe offer that as a compromise something like ""Im busy X amount of time with my time off and have plans with friends but since you haven't got the tickets yet I could come down for a weekend.""

der68p,"YTA (I think)

Look, I don't know what's happening because I can't observe him driving, but your description of his driving sounds perfectly fine to me. Driving above the speed limit (5 miles +/-) is typical. Going 20 over is not, but you don't specify what you mean by speeding. Five accidents is a tad high, but it depends on what we're calling an accident. Someone backed into me in an icy parking lot. That's an accident, but not my fault. I had a car drive directly into the side of my car when I was stopped at a red light. That was 100% not my fault. I hit a deer I couldn't stop in time to avoid...that was on me. That's three accidents and I'm in my early thirties. Five over your lifetime isn't bad. Sometimes thing are out of your control (like the car that hit me at a red light) and even the best driver can't help it.

Your description of his driving sounds highly typical to me. Perhaps that's not the case and you're just not illustrating the danger clearly, but as you put it in your post, it sounds like you're the asshole here."

When I was 16/17 my mum ""hid"" her cancer from us until she needed a ride back from surgery, then she told her boyfriend who encouraged her to tell us. 

I **screamed** my head off at her because I had been dropping hints that she was sick and needed to see a doctor for **fucking months** worried that I would have to find a way to force her to go.    
She *thought* all her clever excuses were hiding it, I was worrying what she was covering up. An eating disorder? drugs? was my mum gonna die from some weird unknown illness because she didn't want to go to the doctor? 

She was trying to limit our worry, but all she did was create more. 

Because at least when it's cancer you know what it is and how it works and that it's being dealt with. Mystery symptoms you got no idea. And that's fucking terrifying.

**Yes she will notice. just because she doesn't say anything doesn't mean she buys your shit. It's much more likely she finds the situation difficult to navigate and is unsure what to do so is acting normal while she worries and seeing if adults step in or getting evidence/advice/whatever before acting. Teenagers aren't *that* bloody dumb and self absorbed that we can't see a giant wall of bs**

just fucking tell her."

Just to check — does your fiancée have her own lawyer working on this as well? She must have one to review and negotiate the prenup."
desesw,"YTA. I mean, the true assholes are the other kids calling him names, but - and here’s the thing - you’re clearly a leader and a kid with a conscience and who knows right from wrong. So what you’re feeling is guilt. You don’t have to be the kid’s friend, but you could tell your buddies to knock it off because this kid clearly has troubles connecting with others and why make it harder on him.

devdj5,"NTA

Your sisters need some kind of therapy. They're definitely old enough that they shouldn't be getting into actual, violent fights with each other. Either one of them or both of them could get seriously injured and they need help.

It shouldn't be your responsibility, but since your parents aren't doing anything, according to what you're saying, it would be good for you to sit down and have a serious conversation with them about it.It'd be best not to come across like you're telling them they're bad at parenting (although they seem to be) and will likely be more productive if you're expressing that you are concerned for your sisters, that this isn't healthy behavior for their age, and emphasize the very real risk of serious injury, suggesting therapy and whatnot.

If they brush it off or don't really listen to you, I would recommend trying to get some other relative you can trust involved. On the one hand, they might feel you went behind their backs, but on the other hand, they might take advice if they see it from multiple people, or maybe your other relative(s) can go to your sister's directly.

This a very serious thing and it's deeply concerning that your parents don't seem to think it's a big deal.I don't know at one point you may want to get greater legal authorities involved to protect your sisters from each other, but I don't recommend that as the immediate step, because it might not be good for them to potentially get in trouble with the law and not necessarily get actual, helpful treatment.

TL;DR  
You should talk to your parents about this, trying to sound nonjudgmental and emphasizing your concerns for them because it is not healthy and age-appropriate behavior for them to be getting into violent fights. If they don't listen, you should probably try getting someone else involved to help them, such as a relative you trust. I wouldn't recommend going to legal authorities against your sisters to protect them from each other unless you absolutely have to, as it could cause them serious distress and may have a permanent affect on their lives, such as their ability to get future jobs or adopt or many other things they may seek to do.

I'm sorry you're dealing with this. You shouldn't have to have this responsibility. Good luck with everything."
deve6l,"I mean you answered your own question. She will be upset = she will think you are the asshole no matter what Reddit thinks.

At 23 years old, your car would likely become a money pit.

Have you considered taking it to a mechanic? Ask them to check it out and let you know if any parts will need replacing soon -- get an idea of how much it'll cost to keep running for another few years.

Can I be honest with you? You sound like you are not fun to hang out with.

>I know I'm not good at social stuff, but do I really have to go out of my way to make people comfortable?

Yes, yes you do. Do you think your friends don't enjoy being with their girlfriends, just the 2 of them? I can assure you they do, yet they still invite you because you are their friend and they want to hang out with you too. 

However, you actively do nothing to build a connection with their girlfriends, you don't even try apparently. This behaviour will eventually lead to them being fed up with your behaviour and you won't be invited anymore.

Eventually you'll be alone. Friendship is not something that just pops out and then that's it, you are friends with a person forever. It's a give-give relationship and you DO have to go out of your way to make people comfortable, if you want them to be comfortable around you. It's also a relationship that fades away over time, especially if one party deos nothing at all to keep that friendship going."
dewn2z,"NTA - you are right.

dewsy2,"Oh my, is the world really this small? This could be a total coincidence and I guess I have no real way to confirm either way, but I had a VERY similar conversation with a customer today over a missing burrito and side of cheese dip.

Even if you’re not the person I talked to, I’m off the clock now so I have some more words for you and people like you.

First off, it’s so annoying when people say “oh hold on a second :D just wanna make sure it’s all here :D.” Right then I know I might be about to waste time having this exact conversation. Yes, it’s “scripted” because it happens all. the. time. and it’s easier to be prepared.

Second off, I CANNOT return to the restaurant. If I don’t mark your order as “delivered” in a given amount of time, I start getting calls from dispatch. If I mark your order as “delivered” THEN go back to the restaurant, I’ve lost your order info because the system thinks I don’t need it anymore. And usually I have another order waiting to be sent to me after yours, so I have to move on to that one. 

Third off, stop and think about it. Do you want a person you don’t know opening your food containers with their hands that have been touching a steering wheel, dozens of door handles and doorbells, cash tips from questionable places, and that haven’t been washed all day because they’ve been in a car? It’s nasty and not sanitary. I try to verify with restaurants but most of the time they’re practically shoving me out the door. So, sorry.

Fourth off, I spend literally all day (all day) delivering food to people just to make money. With one of my companies I have no choice but to deliver orders I’m given so I CAN’T be lazy. With the rest...I still can’t be lazy because if I am that means less money. You know nothing about this industry.

I couldn’t say this before but I could say it now. YTA."

If your girlfriend is so unreasonable that she would kick you out of the house for saying it's unfair that you are forced to live in and buy supplies for a zoo, I can only imagine you must already know she is crazy.

Something feels weird to me about this post. 

Your kids aren’t allowed to play with toys outside? Your partner lets them. You get mad.

You have one kid who is an “angel” and another who you don’t seem to like. You assume they aren’t disappointed about the dog and maybe that’s true. But a kid getting mad a dog once is fairly normal. 

It seems like you more than anyone was the one who didn’t bond with the dog.

However, him generally agreeing to do this in your home does not mean he has perpetually agreed to an unlimited number of animals. You want to expand and take more— he is making an extremely reasonable point that with four kids and a fifth coming, that might not be a great idea.

It sounds to me like he’s gotten frustrated with you being unwilling to compromise or limit the number of animals in your home in anyway, and that’s why he’s escalating to trying to shut the whole thing down. You need to actually start treating it like both of your homes and respect his needs."

Should you have confronted him make him delete the photo? Probably not - you don't want to escalate the situation. But you should be sympathetic to your girlfriend's feelings. It IS a safety thing.

The best you can do, if you see a long-term future for you two, is to work on creating a life for the two of you away from your GF's family.

EDIT: Wow, not sure I've ever had a comment here blow up like this.  Just to add some context: My sister in law(brothers wife) stopped talking to my family for a few months over songs that my mom insisted be played at my brothers funeral.  Similar to OP, we were raised religious but drifted away from the church as we got older.  My mom wanted to add songs with overt religious themes, which my SIL said my brother wouldn't like.  I wasn't close enough with my brother to know one way or another what he would have wanted, so I said nothing.  I just wanted to convey I think people should generally try to keep the main service as respectful of everyone in attendance as possible, you can still have your own event afterwards to honor the dead your/their way.

EDIT 2: To be clear I wouldn’t call OP an asshole, but they could very well be seen as one by people who don’t appreciate the gesture.  I love the idea of an irreverent ceremony for my death, but my family is largely conservative and I wouldn’t want to make it any more difficult for them to grieve by making it all about what I want."

If your family continues to feed your dog human food, it will continue to have health problems, and probably die an earlier death than if you actually took the steps recommended by the vet."
df5r0t,NTA for getting your own dress but as for the rest...good luck. The people you’ve described so not seem like they will go along with that plan and those dresses will probably not be returnable.
df617g,NTA because you are never an asshole for refusing to talk politics at work. That's just good sense.
df621x,"NTA, that's a really odd thing for her to get upset about"
df68zw,"FFS, you again.

Go take a parenting class. Go get some counseling. YTA for obviously throwing money at the problem in a way that put your kids in a direct comparison. Money is not an apology or a solution. Also can you literally not do anything without singling out your daugther in some way?"
df6c61,I have bad news. I think you're slightly delusional. You wouldn't be cutting ties with them; they've already cut ties with you. You should move on because they already have.
df6ccv,You would be An A-Hole. While I do sympathize with your predicament I don’t believe you have the right to tell someone not to smoke outside of their own home. Have a polite conversation with them and try to figure out a compromise. The rent vs owner dynamic is irrelevant and kind of a cheap shot.
df6frf,"NTA

I would talk with a lawyer and form an appropriate severance plan that takes into account that she's been poaching from your business if there were any written agreements.

I'd also do the math to see if there is technology and of techniques that you need to poach from her to continue servicing the patients that enjoy her services, so you don't lose the patients when she leaves. 

At this point, the damage is done so you need to plug the damage in the most effective manner. Talking with an employment lawyer would be recommended to create the right sort of documents. If you feel termination is the best solution after talking with an employment lawyer about enforceability whatnot. Go ahead."
df6rh1,"This is a conversation you need to have with her, not with reddit."
df6rw8,Sounds like YTA because you obviously need to be single or get a very low maintenance girl. I've been there. You gotta just recognize your needs and not demand she changes for you.
df6yqt,"NTA, but imo the silent treatment is never the appropriate approach.
 
""*We need to talk. I was okay with waiting for you to come to me about whatever is bothering you. I get it, you need to figure things out yourself. But I talked to (friend), you never met and never made plans. You lied to my face. You disrespected our relationship. We need to talk about what's going on*.""

But i like to be blunt and cut the bullshit."
df72yo,NTA.  He lied to you to get in your pants.  That's an asshole move.  You then truthfully related some of his asshole behavior to someone else.  If he didn't want people telling other people that he was an asshole he shouldn't have been an asshole.
df77fo,"YTA. $20 isn't much in the grand scheme of things to signal support. 

Kinda getting an idea where her anxiety and depression might be coming from though."
df79hn,"**YTA** 

But only because ""at the last minute"" isn't the right time to decide that you want someone else to fulfill an important role that you were previously filling.

If not for that Otherwise, it would be **NTA**"
df7bqm,"NTA, but YOU should go to the RA about the roach problem and your roommate's part in it. As soon as you can. It's not reasonable for her to make you live in filth."
df7cxb,"NTA It's not winter, they won't freeze to death, and it's not as if they couldn't afford this if they would stop wasting money."
df7eud,"NTA but I think you should change your approach. Let him know that when he comes to bed at night he’s loud and it wakes you up, and that’s not sustainable. You’d like him to either come to bed earlier or figure out how to do it without waking you up. If he refuses to do either, this relationship isn’t going to work out."
df7g99,"Man, I must be a massive asshole, because I personally would throw it on his front porch. lol.

Reading the comments, though, I guess probably you shouldn't do that. 😂"
df7h0c," Nah.

You can’t expect a toddler to be quiet all day. You just can’t. My toddler is a banshee every waking moment, which is why I would never live in an apartment. Unfortunately, home ownership isn’t an option for some people.

They were nice the first time. I would be pretty peeved by the 3rd or 4th complaint too. As long as the noise ends at night, you gotta suck it up or move. Sorry pal."
df7kja,"NTA— that’s a HUGE liability for the company, and if they knew, he would 100% be fired."
df7knr,"NTA. Completely understandable you don’t wanna have him live with you. Work with your wife to help him find an appropriate living situation, perhaps a care facility"
df7ln3,NTA especially considering how your husbands father talks to your son. Just because he’s family doesn’t mean he should be able to treat your son like that
df7m2s,"YTA a bit. I think it would probably seem like a pretty big omission to your wife.

Consider if you just found out by accident that your wife had a previous conviction she'd never mentioned to you. Would that not bother you?"
df7mwi,"I can't imagine a grown man being unwilling to take a break from gaming/streaming so you can take care of something for a professional pursuit. Is he making any kind of money off of the streaming, or just having fun? Either way, I think a compromise is in order. NTA."
df7nk1,"NTA. That’s a massive burden to put on another person. It would be one thing if he were contributing somehow or if he were really close to finding a new job, but it sounds like that’s not the case."
df7nqg,YTA if you didn't apologize after finding out. Tip: maybe not joke about death for a bit.
df7qwu,"NTA
Your mental health is more important than keeping toxic relationships working, even if they're family."
df7ryx,"NTA. 

Take the money and go enjoy whatever time she has left. Fuck vultures who think they are entitled to someone else’s life of hard work."
df7tac,"I mean yeah YWBTA to uninvite someone you already invited, but it doesn't sound like you're that fond of Brad anyway so I wouldn't let ""technically the right thing"" stop you from having a good time. Sometimes being the asshole is understandable, and I think this is one of those cases."
df7xv7,"Uhhhhhhhh 5 years???

Time to stop taking ""it's being taken care of"" for an answer. Let him know that under no circumstances will you be buying a house with him without a concrete timeline as to when the divorce is going to be finalized (I recommend against buying property with someone you're not married to in general, but especially in this case). Stop looking at houses until it happens. I am honestly shocked you signed and/or re-signed a lease with only that vague answer to go on. I would also tell him you need to see the actual finalized paperwork before moving forward.

I would be very wary of a big commitment with someone like this. It's concerning that you're wondering if you're the asshole for not wanting your boyfriend to be indefinitely married to another woman. NTA but proceed with caution."
df826z,"NTA- Your mom is fine in all of this she didn’t press you or anything but 

Your Brother is a lying asshole, and I’m probably sure your Mom told **him** to take out the dog and he instead lied to get you to it 

But your good"

df8i1a,"WHAT OMFG I CANT BELIEVE YOU ATE MY CHOCOLATE I'm actually screaming dude this is so funny, the title caught my eye and I screenshotted it to and send it to you like 'this is so something you would do' and now I'm shaking omfg this is so funny. YTA. I forgive you. 


I'm crying laughing in the toilet at work."
df8iqb,"NTA, but give a head's up to his parents. They can counsel you and run interference if necessary. If they side with her, though, respect their wishes."
df8nbo,NAH. But... you might regret it later. My husband's brother died suddenly in an accident. There is no going back. There are no do-overs. Spend time with him now. Find something you both like to do. It doesn't have to be best buds 24/7. But spend time with him. Life is too short.
df8r78,"YTA it’s probably Ronald McDonald House. Why can’t she just save them? How is it hurting you? You’re just throwing them out anyway. What a dumb hill to pick to die on...helping charity.

df97he,"NTA mixed with ESH. you should have just ignored the shit talking, it's not like doing what you did solved anything. It could either get worse, or they just ignore you and either find someone else, or continue. best option is to just ignore them. They don't know what you're going through. On a better more, move on from this, know theyre words mean nothing, and be happy."
df97tk,"NTA - this is a get rich scheme. As you know. And have known for his other attempts. Both of you should only do this if it is fun. Otherwise, you’ll just drive each other crazy. 

Odds are he won’t be successful. But I’m sure there may be some fun in this even with a few subscribers."
df98dg,NTA for feeling resentful about the situation.  He's getting to benefit from your sacrifice which is just inherently unfair and your feelings seem perfectly justified to me.  Your parents probably should have thought this through more and treated you both more equally.
df9afy,"YTA.

they paid for it, not you. way to make a day that was probably frustrating even worse."
df9ipe,"I mean, you’re all sharing a room. It’d be weird if they didn’t get sick. You’re not some criminal mastermind."

df9pwh,"NTA for being upset buttt..

Sulking won't really do anything for you.."
df9rno,"NTA

She shouldn’t have looked a gift babysitter in the mouth. Also given how she behaved last time with the dance bag situation it might be time to set some firm boundaries with your sister about how she needs to treat you if she wants you to keep babysitting."
df9snp,"NTA! If you lose her trust she'll tell no one, you keep her safer by being a knowing adult she can trust and call."
df9tgj,"NTA. This is indeed a hill to die on. 

Just make sure you are around when MIL inevitably tries to scold her, and to put her in her place (which is outside of your house, in case you're wondering where's the place of someone violating the privacy of their hosts)"
df9w9v,Sorry but all I saw is the scene with Andy and Michael when he's doing the baby talk. NAH. Nothing wrong with speaking on what makes you uncomfortable. You just can't expect or enforce somebody's behaivor just because it makes you uncomfortable.
df9xgp,"NTA. However, she is correct. The EAP is meant to be short term. Ours is only 3 sessions then they are supposed to refer you to a long term counselor. I think you needed somebody to talk to. Have you tried getting a regular therapist? by the way not all counselors are comforting all the time. It’s part of their job to challenge you once in a while. Mine definitely lets me know when I need to re-examine myself. I think maybe you could ask the EAP for a referral for a therapist that specializes in anxiety."
dfa0om,"NAH - Buy a new pan and keep it in your bedroom or ""away"" from him, he can use the old one. If he was never told not to put that one in the dishwasher it's not really fair to charge him for a mistake he didn't know he was making."
dfa27z,"NTA - the parents had no reasonable expectations you would know that information, Santa the Easter bunny and tooth fairy are common tales, but house hippos no.... only if you are Canadian and grew up in the 90s would you know about them, and as a PSA.

Also, off topic, not going to lie to this day I still want a house hippo and hate the PSA for giving me false hope. Now I’m relying on science to make one.  So that PSA is the real asshole here."
dfa3oz,"NTA. That dude is in love with you, though."
dfaftg,"NTA. It's his child, too. He's barely slept? Neither have you. Oh, he has a headache? That's great. You don't stop being a father when you get a headache. Tell him to suck it up. Extreme exhaustion and discomfort are just a part of being a parent. 

Source- I'm a father of two."
dfahw6,"NTA - Fuck that guy. He can't free ride off of your hard work.

You should rent the vacation place with AirBNB when you aren't there and actually earn income. A great friend of mine does this with his mountain cabin and does VERY well. He has a lady that he pays $75 a week to clean the place after tenants leave because he lives 3 hours away.

He will probably just fuck the place up.

At this stage of the game you need to be focusing on your own happiness and not bailing out a mechanic who refuses to work."
dfave8,"YTA and so is your husband. His mother can apparently find it in herself to visit her grandchild, so what is his excuse 15 years in? You can't force him to have a relationship with his son, but you don't seem to be exactly encouraging it.

Why exactly would the mom have encouraged a relationship with someone who is a drug addict or a drunk or whatever he was? I wouldn't have wanted him around my son either."
dfaxjn,"Nta, you have no obligation to do any of that. Tell her straight up, to either stay close to you or watch out for the bus."
dfb45o,"YTA. You had a disability and your parents reacted appropriately. If they had perfect knowledge, yeah, they would've reacted differently, but they didn't.

You can consider going to community college and working for the tuition. I know it's not what you wanted, but as long as you plan for next year's applications on time, you'll be fine.  Considering you only got average grades, it'll probably be good for you."
dfb6br,NTA at all. I’m Hispanic and was raised speaking English and Spanish and it’s common courtesy to not speak Spanish when people that don’t understand it are in the conversation.  Usually if we say something in Spanish we immediately translate it.  I thought this was common knowledge.
dfb7xj,"NTA - Your parents put you and your sister's lives in extreme danger by keeping you out of the school system and the medical system (possibly skipping vaccinations) and that still carries over now that they are elderly.

Your Dad made the sensible choice and said ""fuck this shit"" and now your Mom is up shit creek without a paddle. She either needs to take care of her self or face the consequences.

At this point, the best thing you and your sister can do is make sure you raise your children better than you were raised and protect your own mental health from your mother to ensure you can live the best life you can.

I don't know what her issue is, but you're not an asshole for saying ""fuck this""."
dfbapc,"NTA- Tell her you will pay if she does one of the following:

1. Find a paying tenant to live in her room the other 4 days each week.
2. Move her shit out of the apartment and give you full access to her room since you are the one renting it for those days.

According to her logic the above two options would make things fair."
dfbb0f,"YTA

Sorry kid, but it’s time to let go. Just because your sister did some things that were “unfair” to him, doesn’t mean he had the right to cheat on her. It’s sounding like you are making excuses for him because you have such good memories of him. You would absolutely be betraying your sister and everything she went through. 

You need to talk to either your sister or a counselor about how to work through these feelings. And if your sister says to go for it, then by all means. But if she wants you stay away from her cheating ex-husband, you have to respect that."

dfbt4n,"nah...but I think you are starting to learn that truth is relative...one persons clean might not be another..same with having people over..to some, having people over a lot means every night and 3 nights a week is a slow week for them...savvy?"
dfbvdk,"NTA. Kinda. Yeah they should have been on time, hell in all my college life, I’ve only been late to a class once. But the people who had a valid reason for being late (Doctor dude) should have been let in.

I’ve been reviewing movies as a pastime for little over 2 years now, concentrations cannot be broken that easily."
dfbxqg,"YTA -- 

Your insecurities are not your gf's problem.

dfbyhf,"YTA- You should let her log in and see if it impacts your bandwidth.  Just do an internet speed test.  If there is no noticeable impact, no harm no foul.  If it slows down your connection then she needs to buy a router.  Even the cheapest routers now days are fast enough for 2 connections."
dfc02a,"NTA, I thought you literally forced him to walk out. Even if it was about the disability, people’s insecurities are their own problem, not yours."
dfc1jn,NTA. Seems like they ended the friendship first.
dfc2ni,"NAH - I don't really think there is anyone in the wrong here just 2 different perspectives. I can see why you would want to keep it, giving you a visual reminder everyday of what you've overcome. As for her that's just paraphernalia on display in her house. And she might be right about it giving people the wrong idea especially relatives or people who don't know your backstory. Hopefully I think there could be room for compromise here. Maybe keep it in your room or a spare room and not in a high traffic area (assuming it is), or maybe on a shelf that is out of the way, or maybe keep it in a keepsake box that you can look in when you feel you need a reminder?  Best of luck to you both and congrats on your recovery."
dfc4nb,"NTA I feel like on reddit I can’t stress that enough. 
Now I understand she’s your mom, however, is she paying for your school?
If not, then YES let her know. If you don’t want to do small group or whatever, don’t. College is all about trying new things and growing you into an individual. Notice, not what your mom wants you to be, what you want to be.
If she does pay for it, well I’d try to break it to her just not so intensely. Because you don’t want that school loan"

dfcrke,This probably isn’t the right sub for this. You are extremely obviously NTA for trying to help your friend get help after displaying red flags.
dfcx5g,"NTA. The agreement about you being the only one to do chores was based on your period of not working, under the assumption that you were well enough to do the chores. Now that both of those conditions are out, there should have been some redistribution of the work. But to not even clean up the litter box? And leave that all for you to do when you recover? He’s definitely TA here."

dfd9x7,"ESH. You are both insufferable pricks from upper middle class families that are trying to one up each other. For what it’s worth though, 40k is not “climbing up the corporate ladder” that’s basic entry level pay. You sound jealous even if your friend is a bit of an asshole."
dfdajw,"NTA. here and there is one thing, but they’ve hijacked the group chat to showcase their every relationship up & down, the mundane and all things in between. it’s annoying and a bit rude, but also kinda bizarre at this point and getting uncomfortable. idk how you’re gonna get that across without stirring up some shit, tho. but no, NTA."
dfdb3x,"It’s your body and therefore your choice. He’d only have to know about your pregnancy if you chose to keep the baby.

You could tell him if you want, but I don’t think it’s really necessary."
dfdeho,"Surprisingly this is NTA. I went into it expecting some homophobia, but to be honest this is a valid concern any parent should have with a child getting married.

dfdj6s,"ESH. You both procrastinated/didn't do things, and you both seem more interested in point scoring (I did this, but they didn't do that!) than actually completing the task or remaining friends. People drift apart and if that's fine with you, that's obviously fine."

dfec1s,I didn't know it was legal for 6 year olds to get married
dfei3y,"This is a hard one. I think action needs to be taken, especially if this dog’s life is in danger and you have called authorities multiple times, but you can’t just grab the dog from the yard. My disingenuous plan would involve waiting until the dog gets out, locating it several blocks away, and bringing in a “lost” dog to your SPCA. They’ll reach out to contact the owners, and your neighbors will need to pay a fee to retrieve their dog. Play dumb and if confronted by the neighbors act like you honestly didn’t recognize it because “why would their dog be so far away from home after you bought a harness and other items for them out of the kindness of your heart” (even if the kindness was on behalf of the dog and not the people). 

My plan would mean YWBTA, at least in the neighbors’ and your family’s eyes (since they think you should leave it be) and from a moral standpoint of lying is bad, but sometimes it’s important to do things even if you have to be an asshole. This way you’re protected legally, and the neighbors will hopefully learn a lesson without having it out for you afterwards."
dfem2d,"NAH, I'll admit it's very strange that she would do that. But she can change her name to whatever she wants to. Also you are allowed to be angry with her for this. 
Your mother sounds very strange to do something like this."
dfesfz,"NTA. Dude your mother is belittling you and it sounds like she wants to keep you down out of jealousy. Either that or she maybe wants to spend time with you on these walks. But I would never go on walks with her if she’s going to talk to you like that. 

The best thing you can do is keep going to the gym and get fit and prove her wrong. Don’t let her talk to you like that either, stand up and defend yourself. Though don’t stoop to her level next time"
dfevdl,NAH- Not your fault that you didn't know someone was deaf and sure you worked it out in the end so no problem.
dfevo9,"NTA, but try talking to some other people too. Who knows, you might find a group you fit in with better."
dff4ig,"NTA

It's not like you're asking for 50/50..

A proportional split is ok, although I'm shocked at how high your bills are. If you earn 5 x more than her, then pay bills 5:1 (Divide the bill by 6 to work out how much she should contribute)

I would have said N.A.H. but the fact that she wants to contribute nothing towards her household... TA"
dff8d5,"YTA - not for smoking weed (that’s a choice you are entitled to), but for doing so knowing that this challenges your partners fundamental values and beliefs to the core.

What it says is ‘I value this activity/recreational habit more than our relationship’.

Why? Because you have gone from being compatible to incompatible almost overnight.

It suggests you value getting a little high over being on the same page with your partner.

There’s no reason for you not to do whatever the hell you want, it’s your life. But where you were in this together, you’ve now chosen to engage in something that you *knew* would drive a wedge between you.

Where was the communication? Did you speak to her about this before hand? Include her in your reasoning, seek her opinion and input? Does it have to be weed? Are there other ways that you can relax?

You seem to have essentially given her an ultimatum. Deal with it or leave. And that sucks."
dffl05,"YTA said every mother, father, sibling, friend, anyone in the world you told you would call when you got home safely but didn't.

dffr8c,no lol NTA. judging by your description of her/her views i don’t blame you. it’s your facebook you don’t *have* to add anyone/share everything with them
dffs6b,"NAH. Just because you haven't heard from them or recieved anything doesn't mean they aren't thinking about you. If you're the first person from the unit that has been deployed then maybe it hasn't even occurred to them to reach out in some manner. 

The two things that you are taking away from this lead me to believe you aren't an asshope either. You are self aware and you aren't doing anything that would make you an asshole. For me, the thoughts and feelings are not what truly makes an asshole, it's the actions that stem from those feelings. You are taking these negative feelings and turning them into positive actions. You're the opposite of an asshole."
dfg1ve,[deleted]
dfg7j5,NTA But it sounds like you really need more help in learning how to live with/be in a relationship with an alcoholic. I’ve been there and ultimately decided he wasn’t worth it. It was best decision I ever made.
dfg8p7,NTA. Fuck that guy.
dfg924,"ESH. She should have left you alone when asked. But your reaction was way over the top. Forceably taking her phone and then throwing it back at her is way more than what was necessary.
 
And frankly, having a screaming meltdown at her for ""trying to pick up MY boyfriend"" just makes you look like a jealous mess. You embarrassed yourself and probably your boyfriend. 

Also, if his youtube appearances are connected to his work, it probably won't help his career to have a girlfriend who responds to female fans by forceably confiscating their phones and screaming at them because ""MY BOYFRIEND!""."
dfgcct,"This is complicated because your header asks if you’d be the asshole for not WANTING to watch the dog. Which you wouldn’t. But in your question you ask if you would be the asshole for leaving the dog alone, which you would. If you don’t want to watch the dog, tell your bf no. Don’t abandon the dog. YTA"
dfgfns,"ESH - Them for not inviting you or even telling you, you for being horribly passive aggressive and making her day all about you."
dfgfny,"NTA. I know everybody is gonna say ""YTA HEr HOUsE hER rULEs,"" but I seriously think that is a cop out answer that simply shouldn't be used in cases where it's impossible to move out.

I simply can't imagine having to go through what you had to go through. Both of your parents and nearly your whole family is nothing but a dysfunctional shitshow (with your mom having no choice but to take drastic measures), and you have to deal with the consequences by being denied the privacy to even take a break from everything, under pain of being kicked out."
dfgg89,YTA.  Part of being responsible is also having consistency.  “But I was responsible at this period” doesn’t cut it.  What if there was a family emergency and you weren’t available?  Should have kept your phone on loud and in the common area as it’s charging.
dfggbl,"NAH for raising the topic, but something about your post leaves me scratching my head, and I hope you can explain it.

When you say you want to ""ask your partner to relocate"", it reads like you would be expecting a simple ""yes or no"" answer. Like you want to say ""I would like to relocate to be closer to my family and get their support, can we do that please?""

But I feel like the conversation you *should* be having is ""I don't feel like your family are that invested in ours, and I've been thinking about how it might be nice to relocate closer to my family - what are your thoughts on that?"""
dfgj02,"ESH. She shouldn't have kept pressing. You suck because there are 1,000 different ways to tell someone that the people who make them exclusively sell to the people in their community and won't budge on that. You chose a pretty dickish path here yourself.

> I told her no, and she asked for the contact information so she could commission a pair. I told her no again, that the person who makes them is very particular about who she makes them for. She kept pressing me, telling me ""Well let her make that decision!"" 

She shouldn't have kept pressing. But, given your extremely vague answer, ""let her make that decision"" is a reasonable response.

> I got tired of this and told her, point blank, this person will not create or sell anything for you because you are white. 

This vs. ""she/they exclusively make the beads for members of their cultural community, sorry."" What do you think is the better response?"

dfgnl7,"YTA.  You also sound ignorant, naive, and selfish.  




You are underestimating how hard it will be to travel from the US to Malaysia when you are 8 weeks postpartum, especially if you have to have a C-section.  You are going to spend that first 8 weeks getting your baby on to a schedule both feeding and sleeping and you will be exhausted and you will be likely still be bleeding profusely. 



More importantly, travelling with an 8 week old to Malaysia would seriously endanger the baby's health and safety.  The CDC and WHO recommend the following vaccinations for Malaysia: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, typhoid, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, meningitis, polio, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis), chickenpox, shingles, pneumonia and influenza.  Your 8 week old will barely have enough vaccines to protect it at the grocery store, let alone flu season airports, airplanes, and a place where serious diseases are transfered through water.  




Speaking of water, how will your baby be fed?  Formula using local water at risk for Hepatitis and Typhoid?  If you are breastfeeding before you go, you'll lose your milk while you're gone and it will be painful.  If you aren't breastfeeding, hopefully your baby will take a bottle from anyone and not just you, otherwise your baby may not eat until it gets desperate.  It is not uncommon for baby's to hold out eating until it's their mom feeding them.






Now you're not just staying in the foreign country with your baby, you are leaving it there with strangers to it.  You are it's mother and you are responsible for it's health, safety and well-being.  If your baby gets sick while you go off gallavanting around Asia, will you be able to be contacted or be able to get back to it quickly?  





Frankly, this a stupid and selfish risk.  If you wanted to travel Asia with your husband you should have done it before you had a helpless baby to care for.  Your baby will know that you are gone and will be distressed and may not know you when you get back.  





Maybe your parents should come visit you after the baby is born and you could wait go to Malaysia when your baby is old enough to be vaccinated and can be left with family for 2 weeks with out it being detremential to it's development and well-being. 




I sincerely hope you are underestimating the connection you are going to have with your baby.  I have never met a mother who has wanted to leave her newborn to go on vacation for 2 weeks.  A weekend, maybe, but never at 2 months old always later.  It is highly likely that you'll change your mind about leaving the baby to go on this trip and then everyone will try to force to go anyway because ""you promised we could keep the baby"" or ""we've already paid for it"" or whatever and then you'll be angry, resentful, and miserable.  You'll be going against every instinct you have when you leave your baby and it won't be healthy for either of you.  This is a terrible, stupid idea."
dfgr49,"NTA.   I think, but your story was a little confusing.  Did the lady think you were turning but you weren't?  Cyclist like this give other cyclist a bad name.   Cyclist on the road should obey the laws of the road, riding around cars stopped at a light is a no-no where I am from.  If you passed them before the light, they should have stayed behind you at the light.  If you did not pass them and they were stopped at the light first, you should have stayed behind them and passed them when you started moving again."

No offense but this seems really one-sided with the only real effort coming from you. Comparing to other situations I’ve seen., The only reason he’s staying in contact with you is because he benefits from it. Even though it will hurt, and you may be scared of being alone, I would leave him look for someone that will love you as much as you love them.

Also, seeing as he said ‘don’t complain please’ and you keeping yourself silent and walking on eggshells around him about your own feelings. RED FLAGS everywhere darling, red flags EVERYWHERE. 

I would go now before he does and leaves you more sad than you already sound now.

dfnoo4,Why not just ask what she wants? Base your decision then on what she says?
dfnwbh,"Gonna say NAH. If she doesn't realize she's doing it, then she isn't losing anything by being more cognizant of her behavior at work and you have the right to ask her to do so. Just be polite and professional about it, and you should be fine."
dfnwy8,"NTA, you stood by your principles and I commend you for that. A lot of people would find it offensive (I do and I'm white). The stereotype is one born of xenophobia. 

>“You’re white, so you shouldn’t be offended for other people.”

Also this is just an excuse to say you shouldn't call other white people out for racist behaviour which is just incredibly shitty.

You gave them your ultimatum, they chose to do a racist character instead of having you. That was their choice."
dfo0vd,YTA. You’ve been together for a few months! She’s his bestfriend probably for years. Get over yourself.
dfo306,"NTA

He was driving a car when it was in an accident. It is really kind of you to only ask for half. 

Your sister does sound like she is being an asshole. 

Ok... solution time... tell the other option is to make a full insurance claim and the insurance company will go after him as the driver... you were just looking to save them some cash."
dfo37o,"NAH. She understandably needs to talk about her health issues with someone, especially since she's also scared and doesn't know what's wrong. Your feelings are also understandable. You're scared to lose her and also caretaker/compassion fatigue is a real thing. It's hard to support someone going through health issues."
dfo3wi,"NTA because I don't think Ryan is upset because of his behavior causing you guys to be upset. He is upset because he was backed into a corner and forced to apologize. If Ryan went this long acting like a dick and ignored all attempts to point his behavior out to him he isn't sorry. People don't change like that. I also don't think the two emails for the price of one is showing much ""effort"" or sincerity. 

You guys were his emotional punching bag and he wants you back"
dfo5u8,"NTA 

Being friends with someone who is severely depressed is hard. She is leaning on you hard as a support system which is not fair to you."
dfo62t,Get a lawyer. ASAP
dfo83l,Of course you’re NTA. You’re protecting other kids and probably saved him from poking himself in the eye. Well done. Don’t give it another thought.
dfodfg,"Obviously not an asshole, but I’ve always wondered who actually orders the filet o fish."
dfof0u,"ESH - it didn't have to be confrontational but conversational... not unless this has been an ongoing thing. 

You asked him if he knew anything about what you liked and your father simply told you to be happy he bought you lunch... 

I'm going out on a limb here and say this wasn't just about lunch but about the fact that your father doesn't know who you are and didn't consult you as an adult but as a child. He dismissed your preferences and said he got your ""favorite"" when more so he just didn't want to stand in another line. Sure this is a free meal and on the surface it can be perceived as such and quickly judge you as an asshole. But I think you're not... 

If my guess is correct, your dad and you need to have an honest conversation as to who you are now and who you've become and to respect your personhood. There are times parents forget that their children are adults."
dfogzb,"No, NTA.  You are making sure that they are fed and watered, people are coming to check on them a few times a day and they are spending time with them.  Also, your dogs get to stay in their own familiar environment where they are comfortable.  There is nothing wrong with that arrangement."
dfohok,"NTA-Ask him nicely to improve his hygiene 

Don’t be public or, rude about it because that condo be embarrassing for him, if he doesn’t fix then move 

I had a similar situation to you, but the kid was an ass and did nothing but try and argue with me so I eventually just moved"
dfojbk,NTA- just say it’s cramped and you need some space
dfojgu,"NAH. I don't think that's the way to communicate from either party, but I also don't think that anyone involved is an asshole. You seem to care, but you never mention something like you actually force people to eat (if you do, then YTA), you were just asking if M had eaten that day and that was it.

A has their issues and didn't communicate them properly, but it's kind of normal to react when a triggering topic is floating around and maaaaybe they had some stuff on top of it too. They didn't curse at you or acted like a demon spawn, so I don't think they deserve to be called assholes either.

I would recommend talking, like people do, and ask if they feel comfortable (or not) with you asking them if they ate that day. If they don't, just respect it and stop, if they don't care, well you can go on."

dfoo0s,YTA.  Who are you to judge what they do with their money?
dfoooy,"When I was on Weight Watchers years ao, all of us women envied the one man in our group who seemed to magically melt away the pounds every week. How did he do it, we asked. He said his wife did the shopping, cooked all his meals, followed all the WW rules, packed his lunches, made his snacks, weighed his portions. And he credited his wife 100% for his success. ""All I had to do was eat,"" he said with a shrug. 

NTA"
dfougc,"YTA simply because you lied and that is the correct answer to the question you asked. I'm not happy saying that, because there are so many more underlying red flags to this relationship that SCREAM that you need to seriously reconsider living with this toxic person and their toxic habits.  I don't know your relationship or the details, but reading this post I am positively rooting for you to get the fuck out of there, right now.  Abusive relationships are hard to quit unless you do it right away.  And even then, they're still hard to leave."
dfov1x,"NTA, I don't understand why her first thought upon hearing you wanted to be present with your baby was ""you must think we're going to do something to the baby"". That's such a jump to make and it sounds like she's blowing it out of proportion."
dfp1pe,"NTA. What a creep.

The whole thing is a good read, but what we're talking about here is ""The Creepicus Complainicus, of the genus 'Saddest Panda.' His cry is '*Why won’t someone just touch my wiener*?' ” 

You've told him to stop, and he hasn't stopped. In your shoes I'd probably give him one last chance, but frankly you don't owe him that. I'd tell him ""You've been too touchy, and I've told you before to knock it off. If you don't knock it off, I am not going to be hanging out with you any more."" and if he responded with any irritation or anger, anything but apology, I'd cut him off then and there."
dfp1yq,"You're NTA.  Your sister put you in a totally untenable position.  

I have colleagues who work with families who were referred to CPS.  There's a belief out there that CPS are a bunch of mustache-twirling villains who delight in stealing children.  It's not true, CPS is going to work to make sure your nephew ends up in the best possible situation (which you clearly aren't) and will try to get your sister the support she needs to be able to parent her child."
dfp293,NAH- but please reach out to local rescue or find a national one online.  Its a tough decision but there are avenues for help.  I work with an organization nationally that takes in a certain breed of dog and uses donations to help them out.  Please just consider doing some research before you make the choice.
dfp4tb,"NTA. If other students had been disruptive in class, I imagine he would have asked them to leave so as not to negatively impact the ability of others to learn. You are paying for his time, and he is responsible for running a class where you can be successful. He should not have his kids running around the classroom."
dfp4xk,Technically NTA because it's your reputation / good word on the line if he fucks up.
dfp57q,"NTA. The dress completely adhered to the weirdly specific dress code, and it’s freakin gorgeous.

That said, in the future I’d let your girlfriend trust her instincts. It is a very stand-out dress, so I see why she hesitated. But like...*nothing* justifies this level of reaction from your family."
dfp7vo,"NTA

Maybe just leaning towards you since this happened to me on twitter, won a raffle, then he never did it, took on more and more art, even free stuff.

You don't wanna do it, don't say you will. Heck, I even did a raffle (albeit just paying for the art), and I delivered."
dfpaek,"NTA. You really need to get rid of this unpleasant character ASAP. He's only gonna get worse the more he realises how much you and husband will put up with. Oh and FPS start using your freaking dishwasher, man. At least while he's under your roof, put everything in it every night, then you don't need to worry about the germs."
dfpd44,"ESH. Just say no if you aren’t a good enough friend to do it for free. Meanwhile he’s a...raging anti-semite?

And I guess you are willingly friends with one?"
dfpebo,[deleted]
dfphe9,"Dude, don't. YWBTA.  Not because the dude doesn't deserve it, but because the landlord is trying to do things the legal way and you might fuck that up.  I get that it's beyond frustrating and inconvenient for you, but it is what it is.  Just try to be patient and let the legal eviction process happen.  You confronting the guy will only cause more problems and could potentially be dangerous for you."
dfpnyx,"NTA, but as long as you are under their roof, you have to obey their rules.  It sucks that they have such backward, sexist values, but you aren't going to change that.  Move out as soon as you can and support yourself, then you can do whatever you want."
dfppu6,"NTA. On the one hand you gave up a sizable chunk of cash due in large part to your emotional attachment to a physical object. But on the other hand, the family you sold it to will garner much more utility from it than an investor. You did what was best for the people, and I want to live in a world where people matter more than the bottom dollar. Thank you."
dfpxat,"Ouch sounds like he isn't on the same page with where you are in the relationship if his instinct is to get you a $20 sled when you get him a $600 snowboard. 

How long have you been together? And how did you find out what he is getting you?"
dfpyky,"So she smeared shit all over, you made her help clean up her mess, and made sure she was cleaned up properly after? And your dad told you that you were abusing your daughter? Fuck that do not let people get away with making character attacks like that. NTA"
dfpz1i,"NTA, they’re choosing beggars. That said, they aren’t going to understand that and will still think you’re an asshole for doing this"
dfq2ys,"NTA

Seriously? He loses the key and then wakes you up bc he wants fastfood at night? And THEN absolutely destroys the front garden? Wow

He couldve just taken your keychain and moved it regardless..."
dfq57l,NTA I do the same shit with every ex friend or ex girlfriend and the couple ex boyfriend's (except the 2 that ended peacefully with no hate to each other) and tbh alot of times I genuinely do completely forget about them. They are ex friends/partners for a reason why let them back in your life
dfqaid,"YTA why even be in a relationship if you’re never going to prioritize anything above your family? Honestly, just go stay with them forever. You’ll be happier and she can be with someone who actually wants a life with her."
dfqbw6,"NTA. As someone who actually does have those kind of life-threatening allergies, when people exaggerate them unnecessarily it makes it harder for people like me to be taken seriously. It really may be a matter of life and death for someone, and I really hope he realizes the stupidity of inflating/making up an allergy for attention.

By all means have him get another test, which will hopefully reconfirm it’s nothing to worry about."
dfqcni,NTA. Political opinions should not conflict with family relationships. He should apologise and I hope that this situation gets resolved. Political believes should not turn family against each other!
dfqdxb,"NTA

They’re definitely alienating their students instead of fostering an environment where their students will ask questions and want to learn from them. I’d never go to their office hours or raise my hand even if I witnessed this from a TA. 

As far as them complaining about the class and friends seeing names that definitely sucks but I’m sure their friends don’t care about names just that they’re making fun of someone and are laughing at someone else’s expense.

Can you change classes or talk to the professor/school about it? It’s unprofessional at the very least and should be addressed in some manner with them."
dfqf78,ESH- the whole point of group projects is to learn to communicate and work as a team. All of you failed at that. You deserve the bad grade as much as everybody else.
dfqg6f,"ESH- your friends should not call you ugly, that’s just plain rude. You should not put people on the spot by asking if you are attractive.  Pretty is so subjective, you are pretty to some people and ugly to others. Don’t make your friends chose between lying to you and being rude."
dfqgem,"NTA. Not sure how old you are but this sounds like some middle school bullshit where they don’t want to give you a clear answer but want you to keep asking them questions, also if they have to get their friend to tell you instead of telling you themselves you should just stop talking to this person"
dfqhk4,"NTA. Your due date is tomorrow. He needs to be a good parent, and that means taking care of his pregnant wife in her final days before delivery. If he really needs to blow off steam, he needs a foolproof plan for what happens if you go into labor and he isn’t there.

ETA: Him blowing off steam should only be a 30-60 minute thing one time. No way should he be gone longer at this point. And you should not be alone (not counting the 2yo) at all."
dfqopo,"YTA this has nothing to do with food being ethnic or not, you should just be straightforward and say what you actually mean “I don’t care for that food, thanks though”."
dfqvxz,"ESH, she was all the way the asshole and I was fully prepared to be on your side....and then you stopped to her level, maybe even a bit below. She hurt you and you dug the knife in deep in retaliation. I get it, I really do, but yes, everyone sucks. Congratulations on the job btw!"
dfr166,"NAH, it's a nice gesture, but unfortunately media (movies and television) has made it into this wonderful moment, when in all actuality, it can be uncomfortable and definitely inappropriate. 

Good call OP!"
dfr3u0,"NTA, if his computer is so expensive that he can't afford to replace it it would make sense to treat it carefully and store it away from danger.  
This will hopefully help him learn to take care of valuables"
dfr5u5,YTA for the way you put it. You basically said they should roll over and die because they outlived use.
dfr7he,Well even if you don’t move it then vendor probably won’t cause that’s not part of the agreement and they’ll leave and you’ll have to reschedule and wait even longer. So it’d actually probably be easier to just move it on my opinion and get it done
dfr8cw,"YTA. When i was 14 I literally did exactly this and i regret it, if you want start saving some money for a computer but don’t take it out of your savings, as cliche as it sounds you will be thankful you saved this money when you are 18"
dfrala,YTA - honestly it sounds like you’re taking advantage not the other way around.
dfrbab,He’s punishing you because you don’t want to sing? NTA.
dfrdh0,"NTA - I think you handled it perfectly.

However, not everyone that is staring at you is staring because you're different. You put art on your body. If it is interesting or beautiful it's going to draw attention. I have caught myself staring at an intricate piece before. If you hung a painting on the side of your house people would come and stare at that too."
dfrdwn,I’m very biased here because I do the same thing and also have someone who gets angry at me for it. NTA
dfrfh7,"Nta

You are definitely NOT the asshole here.
Your father made some decisions and for that he lost you're respect. HE made those choices, and the outcome is what he made it. Not loving your father anymore doesn't make you an asshole. It makes him the asshole for his actions which lead you to not love or respect him."
dfrgjr,NAH. It's not worth putting yourself through a bunch of financial strain for a wedding. But tell him as soon as possible so he can make someone else best man.

dfrkuk,"YTA big time. It would have been fine to just say no when he initially asked, but rescinding your acceptance is very rude and insulting. Telling him it’s because you found someone better is far, far worse"

dfs5s3,"NTA.

They can't have it both ways: claiming that you're still a kid that can't handle adult life and then relying on you to do be the adult or the trip.

I somewhat understand their frustration: from their point of view you sort of used these foreign countries to ""break the law"", which they disagreed with. Still, you're an adult now, responsible for your own actions, and you don't have sit around and be harassed by anyone, much less do their bidding afterwards."
dfs5xr,"NTA, I wouldn’t even bother with a gift though. Or send her a card with a cat on it."

dfsbu5,"NTA, but I also couldn't be friends with someone who could knowingly do that. Granted, she's not the one who made promises of loyalty to his partner, he is. But there's something to be said for basic decency and standards. Involving yourself might make your own living situation difficult, so I understand not doing it. However, if for whatever reason you do want someone like her in your life, you'd be well within your rights to draw hard boundaries and tell her you don't want to hear about him at any point.

I got no solution for you, but I don't think anyone is being an asshole."
dft1u0,NTA.  This is the few days out of your entire life that is all about you and your wife.  You have every right to defend it tooth and nail.  You said he has tendency to get violent.  You have every right to say who you want and not want there.  Maybe this will get him to wake up to his problem and the ramifications.  Have a lovely wedding without worrying about who will ruin it.  Congratulations!
dft2lv,"ESH i used to work retail and it was always so frustrating watching people come into a building that’s about to close... especially if you’re just going to use the bathroom.

On the other hand it wasn’t your intention and the employee didn’t need to use forceful language and/or be rude about it."

dft9zo,"Don't confront him. Do tell the doctors.

The truth is, there ARE supplements that help repair myelin. Acetyl L-Carnitine, for example, has been shown to do so in numerous peer-reviewed studies conducted by universities and published in reputable  journals. But not all doctors are up-to-date on research.

It also can be deadly when mixed with blood thinners.

If your friend's dad feels strongly about what he's giving her, he needs to approach the doctors with reputable research and convince them it's the right plan.

But for her doctors to not know what she's taking is dangerous.

*Note: This is not medical advice. I don't know if it's ever been studied for transverse myelitis. Just an example of a supplement that has been shown to help certain conditions that affect myelin."

dftdge,NTA bordering on validation post. You literally did nothing but exist as a person in a relationship. How could that possibly make you the asshole?
dftf46,"NTA

I am very sorry your parents reacted this way. You sound like you are putting in a lot of effort to do the things you enjoy. It’s good you reached out to your parents. Don’t write them off entirely, your dad probably though of raising a softball playing kid for decades and to have one get there and then stop may put him in a spot where he’s acting in emotional instead of rational ways. They may still not understand how much wearing the clothes means to you. Maybe the way to think about it is less they don’t support you but they aren’t supporting you in exactly the way you want.  Maybe they don’t know exactly what you expect out of them. I bet if you clear this up things will get better. Good luck"
dfthzt,"NAH

It’s a fine line to straddle. You are entirely right to set boundaries for yourself and don’t just say yes to avoid the guilt. You have to stand up for yourself. But there may be times you get asked if you can babaysit and you do have time, saying no out of principle would be an asshole move. Just keep communicating your boundaries and set expectations"
dftm6a,"NTA, it's a horrible situation to be in, but yes, the niece should know they have a sibling somewhere. Could someone else in the family help with the communication? And the niece will need support as well and it could be a very difficult time for everyone.

dftm8e,So.. the phone doesn’t wake her up but magically she is able to use it as an alarm. She needs to put it on Do Mot Disturb or set an alarm like an adult.
dftou8,"NAH It wasn't certain if the baby was definitely your nephew until the test results came back. However you can't have a relationship with a newborn unless the parents consent so you should ask the baby's mother if she's okay with you sending a gift. 

As a side note, you aren't estranged from the baby. That word means you used to have a relationship or be close."
dftpar,"This situation sucks, but NTA. 
They at first seem to be altruistic and generous.  This is a false understanding—they had hero/savior complexes (co-dependent = like saving, being needed, being the hero).  Bc as soon as a tiny comment asking to tone it down, they full-force against you.  
A normal person, who had gone a bit too far, would’ve rolled eyes at you and dropped it. 

If it were me, I’d reach out once, again express how appreciate their kindness for housing and treating like family, but I’d never apologize or criticize them. I’d do letter.  Then you’ll have 100% no guilty conscience. 
Otherwise I’d hang w Carl and never mention and pretend it never happened and let him tell his family to shut up."

dfvral,NAH - but you need to know lies can be hard to keep up with. It isn’t to late to be honest. You could tell her you put it up to prevent it from breaking. It was expensive and you want to keep it in good shape for when you really need it.
dfvvil,"YTA

I can see why others think NTA though but for me;

1 - this guy has had a life-changing injury, you are the only person he considers a friend. Be a decent human being and go visit him. He must be extremely lonely. 

2 - The cause of your breakdown in 'friendship' was issues he has no control over, esp as a young child - he might have changed - you won't know until you try. 

You are not obligated to visit him, in any way. But being nice to people is something we should all try to do more of."
dfvww6,"NTA.

If she misbehaves and you've already made the promise then follow through.

You can all go as a family when she starts behaving better.

dfwjse,"NTA

I use this lesson parents teach their children on adults who don't know how to treat other people, ""If they don't know how to play nice, they don't get to play at all"".

Your aunt isn't communicating with you in a respectful way, so don't communicate with her unless she does. The next time she acts aggressively, I'd let her know that you will no longer be responding to her when she behaves this way. She'll freak out, she'll tell your mom. Stick to your guns.

You're an adult now. There's only so much control she has over you, even if it doesn't feel like it. You have to re-train her how to treat you and draw firm boundaries"

dfwsri,"ESH, I know it’s frustrating seeing your friend put up with being treated like shit, but you being cold to her is just gonna push her closer to him. She’ll realize in her own time he’s a piece of shit, but in the meantime just be a good friend to her. But also, don’t feel obligated to keep giving her advise. Tell her she knows how you feel about it and let it be."
dfwvkt,"NTA most everyone laughed in my theater during that scene, I also laughed when he dropped the gun."
dfww9v,"It depends on how you are addressing it with them, honestly.  Do you show them the budget to teach them how to budget, and show them that lean months require sacrifice, or are you aggressive or even passive aggressive with them ""well, if i didnt have to support you i could afford expensive shit too?!?!""

Its important to teach your children how to budget by leading by example, without burdening them with your problems.  If you dont want the ones who are working to have the advantages of living with their parents then help them get an apartment together that they can afford independently of you.

Im going YTA, because jealousy is an ugly look on anyone and is probably driving the tone of your conversation away from teaching them how to budget for themselves and more toward martyrdom."

I know it will be difficult, but nobody said things in life would be easy. This is as much your grandpa as your grandpa was several years ago. This is a part of who he is now and as painful as that is you should experience it. He’s suffering, your family is suffering, you’re suffering and if what your brother said is true, that this could be his last birthday? I think you will deeply regret not celebrating it with your family. I’ve had several family members forget who I am, it never stopped me being there for the fleeting moments that they knew. Even when they didn’t and were in too much of a drug haze or sleep to recognise we were there, we were there. Go and be there."
dfxs12,"Honestly, ESH. I don't think that your wife should be threatening to quit her job because you wanted to take a nap.

dfxywx,"YTA. You listened to a girl tell you she isn't ready for a relationship (with no disclaimers to indicate that she'd be down for working towards that), tried to kiss her anyway, and then bombarded her with messages trying to get her attention and asking her to hang out again after you already violated her boundaries by trying to kiss her. Whether out of ignorance or apathy, you're being way too much here and you need to leave her alone. Honestly if I were in her shoes I'd say you're too much trouble and lose any interest at all."
dfxzlu,NTA. That’s extremely unprofessional of her to ask coworkers to borrow money and help with rides. I’d bring it up with your manager.
dfy15x,"NTA - Screaming ""To Hell with you!"" is hardly keeping tb Bible teachings... Remind her of the following:

Corinthians 6:14  
Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?

or

Colossians 4:5-6  
Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time. Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person."
dfy1ng,"NTA

She threw the other women under the bus because he didn't victimize her. 

It's also possible that he DID fuck with her, and her self image can't tolerate thinking about it or having anyone even *think* that maybe she got her position not for being a good worker but because she bent to his perversion.

I'm not saying she did. But I can see her fear that people might start to wonder and she's trying to derail it."
dfy3qr,You're BF needs to take care of this issue not you. NTA

dfylwt,">i turn a blind eye to meat industries and still eat meat 

ESH. Obviously you shouldn't eat food you find morally objectionable, for any reason. Here's the thing though: I'm no PETA-head, but factory farm animals (the ones you turn a blind eye to) are treated horrifically. You bothered to learn about what makes meat halal and now choose not to eat it because you find it morally repugnant. Good for you, but it lands as a bit racist that you only apply that standard to halal meat and not other factory farmed meat."
dfyomy,NTA.  It doesn't sound like this needs to take place in the middle of the night on their porch.   I can't imagine planning something like this and not thinking about how it will irritating the neighbors.

dfyr8n,NTA my god people are so soft these days. Like if i get a tattoo of Donald duck all of a sudden I'm offending the duck kingdoms all around the world
dfys5u,"NAH- if course you’re annoyed, but your roommate does not have any obligation to run your errands. She sounds flakey, but not an asshole."
dfysee,"NAH- but you and your fiancé need to figure out how to communicate. It sounds as if your actual concern is that he does not have a full time job right now, while he seems to see his delivery money as being a contribution to the household."
dfyxkn,"NTA, call the cops about the noise and also say you are concerned with how the father screams obscenities at the family and overall how he treats them. I would not be shocked if that father would abuse any of those family members, you could potentially be saving them from abuse, or future abuse."
dfz1pb,"YTA.

Maybe you’re right, maybe you’re not. Do NOT, under any circumstances, test that theory. Especially since you admit you have a biased view of her.
Every time you see her, she has breathing issues? And supposedly her allergy gives her breathing issues? Are you really not seeing the connection here?"
dfz1xy,"YTA

unless you curve the whole class, it’s not fair that you artificially inflate one kid’s grades just because he TOLD you he’s TRYING to get into top schools. You don’t know who else in that class is also doing the same, trying just as hard, and earning the same top marks in all their classes. 

If students are completely mastering your material and NOT earning near perfect grades in your class, that’s a fault with your system and it should be amended in everyone’s grades, not just one student’s."
dfz64a,NTA - The real AH here is the person trying to force your boyfriend into an unwanted friendship. Her husband wants her alienated so it’ll be harder for her to leave him. Have one honest conversation with her stating as much and let it drop. If she chooses to let herself be manipulated that’s on her and not you.
dfz8wh,"YTA

Tbh, I'm surprised that you are so inattentive towards your own girlfriend, that you don't even notice her being ignored so blatantly and rudely. You are supposed to support your girl.

In any case, not greeting someone just because she is a woman is such a wild concept to me. I and everyone in my circle gets greeted at least with words, and often with handshakes too, despite being woman. In your place I would not associate myself with someone who is so backwards in their worldview that they would ignore a woman just because she is a woman..."
dfzdm7,"NTA

That's super weird. Normally I suggest the actual relation of the in law handle discussions with their family not a spouse. However, in this case your husband is hurting and I think it is fine to step in with a polite 'My husband would never bring this up, but it really upsets him so I'm saying something.'"
dfzgmc,"NTA, but be prepared for drama. Weddings can bring out the worst in people"
dfzhac,[deleted]
dfzi7d,"NTA

She wants to take credit for the gift, and with the way you described her, there is a big chance that she is gonna milk this if you let her pay. If she wants to be part of it so much, just let her buy seat covers, air freshener or something similar that's within her budget and could be used for the car. This way she technically was part of the gift, but you can easily seperate her part as ""me and my husband bought you this car, and that accesory for it is from your Mom"". Nice and civil.

Edit: because so many people can't get over the fact that I wrote ""air freshener"" together, I put a space there. You are welcome."
dfzmvq,NTA and your office manager is TA. If you share then the office manager has even less of a reason to stock supplies and you are going to end up buying everything for the office. If your coworkers are upset you don't share they can either do what you are doing and bring in their own or they can complain to the office manager about being out. Sounds like they won't order until there is enough of an annoyance from complaints to order anyway.

dfzzg0,"NTA but... your brother is awful and his behavior indefensible.  The ""but"" comes in because unless there's a lot more to this story you only have to deal with his BS for 3 days a year and those 3 days seem to mean an awful lot to your mother.  Your mother has done a lot for you, including giving you an apartment so if you could find it in your heart to view this as something you do for her it would be nice.  It's reasonable to be infuriated with your bro, though."
dg01r0,"NTA 

Assuming what you say is true, your review was accurate.

Unless the falling out was over your gf doing something absolutely horrible, then it's unreasonable to assume you can't be there at the bar."
dg05gj,"I think YWBTA if you made that call without following up with the manager first. I think since you were asked to be a witness, it wouldn't be out of line to ask questions about the follow-up. Explain that you're confused by the inconsistent application of policy and consequences with regards to substance possession/use at work, and that given the nature of your job you are concerned about potential repercussions of your coworker being impaired. Perhaps your colleague has a medical prescription or some other extenuating circumstance, and you can work out a way to make sure you can count on them to be fit for duty.

If your manager isn't willing to have that conversation (assuming you approach it in a reasonable, calm way) I think that's when it would be appropriate to escalate your concerns."
dg08np,"NTA I definitely think you should say something. This kind of thing can become very racist and culturally insensitive, and kids need to be taught early on that that's not acceptable. Speak to the teacher or principal. Don't be accusatory, just voice it from a place of genuine concern."

dg17ip,"NTA, because you're probably going to save them one heck of a legal bill down the road. If someone injures themselves on their property, even if they weren't supposed to be there, they will likely be on the hook for medical bills. If it comes out that they were intentionally booby-trapping the walk, they'd get hit with additional penalties. The way to do this is to put up a fence/gate with trespass warnings."
dg1985,YTA. Art is a totally different field. Not every artist is succesul but more doctors are. Also your sister said although she disagrees she would support you and you should follow your dream while you plainly slapped it on her that she shouldn't do thi what that she said to you.

dg1vqd,"NTA

I think all the people who are going off about how you should have gently informed her not to do that don't really understand panic responses. You saw a baby in potential danger and you stepped in to stop that danger as quickly as you could. 

That being said. 

Now that the crisis is over, you should absoultely go apologize to her and explain calmly that shaking a baby can seriously hurt them, and that yelled to make sure she stopped immediately."
dg2d9a,"So you and your parents are lying to your brother because you're mad at him for not being as attached to your family pets as you? How dare he not like the same things as you to the same degree? Now he deserves to be the black sheep of the family and be excluded from important news! Seriously?

Of course you are. Say it with me: COM MU NI CATE. Put on your big girl panties and use your words.

Edit: I'm done with this thread. But I've got to say this for anyone who finds there way here: The kind of feminism on display here is the exact kind that is causing people to lose confidence in the cause. He is allowed to say no to condoms. She is allowed to say no to sex without condoms. Both are okay. She is choosing to deceive him, which is not okay."

""My girlfriend has a hard time getting and staying pregnant. I know! I'll crank up her stress levels, because stress, being one of the major known causes of miscarriage, is s great thing to put on my girlfriend right now! Weeeee!""

Seriously, dude, grow up. She's allowed her opinions, and so long as she's not being a thorn in your GF's side, it's a big nothing.

Further, you don't get to dictate that unilaterally. You're not God-emperor of the baby or your girlfriend. You're Dad.

Be there for your girlfriend, stop getting caught up in petty bullshit."
dg2y4w,"NAH

dg2zof,">Things were going so well with my family at the moment and she didn't have to dredge up the past but she did

no offense intended but that's the kind of logic abusers use to silence people.... ""so what if things were bad they're good now so why do you have to bring it up"" 

rather than getting angry and lashing out at her for being open and honest why don't you guys do some self reflection and consider her feelings instead of trying to shut her down because ""things are good now so you don't need to stir the pot"" 


>But it's all in the past and we've all moved on

it doesn't sound like she has.... maybe instead of dismissing her you guys should make an effort to help her reconcile her past?  you say she wasn't around much even before she moved cross country. maybe she hasn't had the time to rebuild those relationships from her past for whatever reason. 

yeah YTA

I mean seriously? 

so you all just don't give a shit about how she feels at all.... I can't imagine why she would feel the way she does /s"
dg30uv,"NAH *because* I think you meant well, but I also think you were a little naive. Of course using and owning second-hand items is perfectly acceptable, and also a great way to save money, but not everyone is going to feel that way when it comes to gifts for big holidays. 


Obviously the kid isn’t going to care (the dress I wore for my 7th birthday party came from a Salvation Army but it was mint green and shiny so I loved it), but there is a lot of societal pressure to buy “new” things for a birthday, and even though thrifting is once again “trendy” among certain crowds, it’s also still heavily stigmatized in some circles. 


Hopefully when your niece is older you can pass on your thrifting ways!"

More importantly, it’s not within your budget. Ask one of them by text to bring beef if they want it. I think this is not worth worrying over."

dg4ytj,"NTA. I worked with a client with borderline personality disorder and eventually, I ended up quitting that job because even though I knew that she sees things completely differently (black-and-white thinking) and that I shouldn’t take any of it personally, it was exhausting and started to wear on my mental health.

dg56ns,"YTA.  Let me point out a flaw that you have, so you can improve yourself: You're rude and arrogant.  

If someone wants constructive criticism from you, they'll say so.  If they don't ask for it, then you need to get off your high horse and just be friendly with them the way they are...or if you think they're too flawed for you, go make friends with your mirror."

I'm not sure what agency is best (Better Business Bureau, Gas company, etc.), but I feel like someone should be notified so the problem can be fixed once and for all."
dg5fv3,"YTA for a few reasons, humblebrag not even being one of them. Did you ask their mom if this was okay? Being that you're an absent father, you should've talked to her before such huge gifts. Also, making them battle it out between two big gifts is completely A-Hole worthy. Tell them they can choose if they want the watch or the car and if they both want the car, then buy both a car."
dg5g1n,"NTA. You didnt ask for this and it isnt your fault - you just needed help. A similar situation happened to me when I was around your age, its never fun and can make you lose a lot of trust both from and for others.

Feel free to reach out if you want someone to talk to <3 life does get better, it just takes a while sometimes."

She clearly doesn't understand that not everyone is fortunate to have parents wealthy enough to dish out $3k a month to them, or to just go out and buy them a new car.  Hopefully after hearing your remarks she starts to understand that."
dg5rdn,"NTA, she sounds like a thundercunt for going off on you for something like that, and she might have blowing up on you for her own personal gain."
dg5scd,NTA. She can't bully you for your orientation then demand you go out of your way to protect her when she's scared. It's not like she was in danger at the moment and you ignored it. You just didn't go out of your way for her and that's your right considering how she treats you. Hopefully this was a wake up call for her. You don't owe her shit.
dg5som,"ESH.

She sucks because you should never hit your spouse (I saw you mention that on your original post before it got deleted), and for your son's sake she should try harder to make things work where you're at.

You suck because you literally didn't consider your wife's input when moving to another country. That's crazy and controlling. This is supposed to be a partnership -- you are not in charge. She made it VERY clear she didn't want to move to Germany, and you unilaterally decided to do it anyways.

I suggest therapy. You both need to work on your communication skills and be nicer to each other."
dg5sve,NTA. Those aren't friends. I wouldn't pay the last $300 either after they kicked you out like that.

dg5uqj,"NAH. Some people are great at gifts and some people just suck at them. My boyfriend is like your girlfriend. He's terrible at gifts. At first I was like you, disappointed that 'he don't know me and doesn't know what I like' but I looked at it from a different perspective. I love him, the gifts he gets are so random and out of nowhere I never know what to expect. I love it. Its so him and I wouldn't change it for anything in the world. All I'm saying is that maybe it isn't about the gift at all.."

dg64wq,"NAH, but I think your gf was trying to tell you that as a white male, using a different colored emoji ranges for poser-ish to appropriation.

Is it dumb?  of course, this is an emoji.  But I think there's more layers to that these days.  You'll see it in fashion and music especially.  What's the line between cultural appreciation and cultural appropriation?  As a white male, it's a social standard that you've had the freedom of the default up until now and to jump and use something, albeit small like this emoji, smacks of another example of blaseness in taking whatever you want even if it wasn't really meant for you"

dg6bhq,"NTA. You don't have to hang out with people whose company stresses you out. By what you said, you weren't rude or mean to her, so I don't think you've done anything wrong at all.

Also has she even mentioned that you guys haven't hung out, or tried to see you? Cause if she hasn't, I reaaaalllyy wouldn't lose any sleep over it."

dg6m7n,"ESH.

Obviously, what they're doing is unfair and ridiculous. This is not the 1800s, but apparently shunning is still alive and well.

But also, you're 28 years old. You should be financially independent. And it's not fair to have your 70-year-old dad struggling to pay bills because you want to manipulate him into seeing you. That's not how relationships work."
dg6pv5,"YTA

If you dont talk to her, one of two things will happen

1. You never propose, she questions why
2. You do propose, and start your marriage unhappy

Not talking about marrige when you both want to get married is such a bad start"
dg6riv,ESH— you both suck for getting married without having this discussion.
dg6t73,They’re butts not buds.
dg6v7c,"YTA because ""I don't want to do these things anymore and instead relax on my days off and do the normal chore list."" This makes it sound like you don't really want any part in planning the wedding that YOU agreed to. I'm betting that your fiance and her mom are doing more work than you are, and it's completely appropriate that they try to keep you involved and ask you to contribute and help out. I understand you didn't want a big wedding, but ultimately you DID agree to it instead of compromising on maybe like a medium-sized wedding. You should be less concerned about you getting to relax and more concerned with making your wedding day a wonderful celebration that your fiance will be happy with; it's a huge day for her, for you, and for both of your families, and it only happens once. I think it's okay if you ask your fiance if you can do a little bit less, but make sure that you discuss it properly and make sure your fiance is getting time to relax too."
dg6vpk,"NAH.  Some people just don't mesh, it happens.   The only thing that stuck out to me is that it sounds like you open up by telling people your struggles.  You may see it as letting them in but they probably feel like you just dumping your emotions on them.  If you want more friends, make a point to listen more than you talk and dont go too deep, they're not your therapist."
dg6w8s,"YTA. You are NOT listening to the teacher. You are excusing the equally horrific actions of the British government, which include hanging people and throwing bombs into houses with children in them. Keep in mind, half the people killed by the British and loyalists were *civilians*; half the people killed by separatists were army officers, police, or other armed combatants (from Malcolm Sutton, I believe). At least the IRA knew who to kill instead of attacking everyone.


The IRA had reasons for their actions; whether they were excusable or not is a different question. If you had sat down and listened, you might've learned what forced the Irish to take desperate measures.


Honestly, you sound like an uneducated brat who refuses to look outside their worldview. You need to learn what caused these Troubles, and that includes listening to your teachers and treating them with respect."
dg6yqz,"I don’t think there is a clear-cut answer here. Your father has the right to set the terms for his own wedding. However, you reserve the right to not attend if you feel uncomfortable, especially with your transition being so recent (at least for your family). However, if you don’t go, your father will be upset, and you say that you will not be comfortable to attend without support. 

I’m gonna say NAH, but you should still see if there is a way to come to some kind of compromise. You bringing your mom, someone he seems to be comfortable with attending his wedding, would be a good option."
dg73go,"YTA - she didn't want a statistical response, she wanted you to tell her you loved her. 

Being technically right doesn't mean you're not an asshole."
dg75u9,ESH. You’re dumb for trusting someone you know you shouldn’t. She’s dumb for letting her family steal. Get a new girlfriend.
dg75zd,JOEY DOESNT SHARE FOOD
dg7e3d,"I may not have the popular opinion but luckily all opinions are allowed. I’m sorry, but I think YTA. 

Do you trust your boyfriend? Does he go to strip clubs often? It’s just one night and he is a grown man. He isn’t trying to hide it from you and as long as he is going to a reputable place, no touching is allowed. So I think it’s only going to be a big deal if you make it one.

Still, of course you have the right to your feelings and some people hate strip clubs or porn. 

Do have other reasons why you don’t trust him and any opportunity he might cheat on you? Or does he seem to have solid character and you just don’t like it? Is there a pact that you two can make about this that will make you feel better that can maybe even help you grow closer?"
dg7ea9,"ESH. Seems like a total battle of egos.

I get that you would get upset when you're called out like that, a totally natural reaction. To then go on and just fling shit at each other like that is just plain immature. At some point, someone has to be the bigger person"
dg7fgt,"NTA.


You're not a professional and this is what your friend needs. You cannot give up your time and energy for zero compensation. This is not a knock on you, but sometimes people who aren't trained counselors accidentally say really harmful things; that's why she needs someone with training.


You are doing what is best for you and, in the long run, your friend. Hopefully, she'll see a counselor and realize you were trying to help."
dg7jkc,You would be TA if you ghost him. It really sucks when people ignore you. It makes you feel shitty and confused because there’s no explanation or proper closure. You would not be TA if you explained why you’re uncomfortable and why you think it’s best to stop talking to him. Good luck!
dg7ncc,"YTA based on your explanation in the comments. As long as what she’s wearing is within the dress code, it is absolutely none of your business. There are one of two explanations here: you bring up how men perceive her and how others talk about women behind their back (which is asshole behavior by itself), so this is seemingly you being sexist on how women have to “prove” themselves in the workplace, or you’re sugarcoating it as this not being “professional” when you’re actually just being insecure of other men possibly oogling at her. Either way, this is possessive behavior. Your wife can dress however she wants as long as it is, again; within the work dress code."
dg7pe4,Nta. Can you buy things that you can store in your bag or at school? If he eats it he should replace it.
dg7pns,It’s really weird that no one sees a problem with 8-12 year olds being out after midnight and thinks you’re an asshole. The noise cutoff where I live is 10pm but I wouldn’t expect it to be coming from a bunch of tweens. NTA
dg7tvh,"NTA if she can't perform basic functions of her job then management needs to know. Being at the front desk also requires at least some social finesse which she doesn't seem to have either. Overall, it's just not a good fit for her.

I can also see how eventually this will negatively affect a guest's customer experience if it hasn't already."
dg7v0d,NTA-you paid her for a service and she is not providing that service.
dg7w49,NTA. Dude was using shared grief to groom you into a relationship. Ghosting was a good move.
dg814q,"I feel like NTA, because a few things on their side don't add up.

How did their friend suddenly find a 9 month old ""found dog"" facebook ad? The dog's response gives me the same impression - surely if they just lost him he'd be really excited to see his old family?

What did the dog look like in the photos though? If you found him 9 months ago and they lost him 3 months before that, that could be enough time for him to start looking rough."
dg838m,"I can't even judge this post because it makes me so depressed.

EDIT: Nevermind. I just saw that letting her live in the house was in lieu of paying child support and alimony. Why didn't you include that in your original post? That's a pretty big detail to omit. YTA. Absolutely."
dg86zf,"YTA if you think that this is something she can just decide to stop doing and just treat you super great then go back to feeling depressed later... when it's more convenient. She's dealing with a major, long term depressive episode and you're complaining about not being paid enough attention. Sure, it'll be hard for you but you're missing the point of you think your lack of attention is, in any way, nearly as devastating as a mental health issue."

dg8cr9,"NAH they are trying to be helpful to everyone by ensuring the gifts that are given are needed and appropriate, and you enjoy the thrill of the search. No one is wrong or an asshole. Me, personally, I loathe shopping and would greatly appreciate a list to fulfill social convention, but you like it and that’s ok too. Politely explain you had some other ideas, and you appreciate the thought, but you’d prefer to keep your gift to yourself to make it a surprise."
dg8j30,"I'm going to say NAH, it seems like you just didnt communicate the research you did prior to your bf and that might have reassured him while instead it looked to him like you forged on ahead without giving him another thought."
dg8l75,"NTA. She should not be in student housing regardless. I don’t think you should talk to her PO, but maybe speak to the people in charge with your building.

It sounds like you guys tried to make it work but her feelings stopped her from enjoying anything on a birthday. I'm sure that you couldn't avoid your work arrangements unless she misunderstood that. But I feel that her talking to other people negatively about you guys like that instead of sorting it out isn't really friend like. Do as she asked and you could always say that's what she told you guys to do."

Nobody should put up with that sheet."
dg95h0,"I would say NTA. Normally parents do not owe tuition, but you guys did have a verbal contract. He gave you hope, and a chance to imagine a specific future before taking it away from you.

dg97kv,You're obviously NTA
dg98yf,"Ask her whether she wants it chucked or moved into smaller containers and tell her it's because you need the pot available, no reason as to why you shouldn't be communicating with her about this. I guess my response would be YWBTA because that's no way to go about this situation."
dg9921,NTA. He damaged your property! He should be the one who has detention.
dg99ad,"NAH: you want to sleep, he wants to rev his engine. Rather than texting him (since you say you've known him for a long time and since you have his number, I assume you're at least on basically friendly terms) I'd suggest that you go see him on your day off, catch up a bit, and then mention that you work 3rd shift and when he revs his engine for that length of time at that hour of the evening, it disrupts your sleep. It's so random that he would be doing that every night at the same time. Perhaps there's an explanation and you can figure out a solution in which everyone's needs are met and no one has to be an asshole."
dg9c3h,NTA he is married.
dg9d7d,"NTA. Your house, your boundaries. If your mom tries bringing her over again don't let anyone in the door, and make it plain why. Based on what you've said here continuing to associate with her and her husband will only cause you stress and anxiety."
dg9g55,NTA fuck them and every family member messaging you. It is *your* wedding and your reasons are completely reasonable. He had a lifetime to earn the honor of walking you down the aisle and as the one who willing chose to leave your life he does not get to choose when he has earned that honor.
dg9h60,NTA for using the coupon but if I were to use a coupon like that I would’ve split the cost of the meals for both so each are paying half of one meal.
dg9j4e,NTA. Dude you felt scared. You did what you had to do to protect yourself in that situation. I wouldn't have sent all the texts but that is appalling behavior for an adult. The car in front didn't cause anything and he was lucky he did that to an old lady and not anyone else. Where I'm from that would have gotten him beat up or killed and he needs to know how serious that is.
dg9k04,"NAH - So it's pretty normal to be nervous around a newborn baby. That goes double if you've never held one. It's like jumping into the deep end of a pool without swim lessons. I was pretty nervous when I held my baby for the first time (though I think you may have me beat.)


But it sounds like you have people who are willing to teach you when you are ready. Until then, watch, learn, and be willing to admit that you're still nervous. No shame in waiting a bit to try something new.


Honestly, all you need to know is to support the head/neck and to relax a bit. But be open to it, and you'll get there."
dg9spq,">I can see the misunderstanding, but my reasonable explanation should have cleared that up. 

Your explanation wasn’t reasonable.  Not to her.  Who needs to have “coup d’etat” translated?  Everyone knows what it means.  Your “explanation” came off as an excuse for you to stare at her chest.  Of course she was upset.  She shouldn’t have insulted you like that, but your response was way over the top, especially considering that your behavior is what started everything.

YTA"
dg9stc,NAH just talk to him. He may be more comfortable spending money on himself because you openly say you’re a frugal person and don’t like spending money.
dg9ycx,"Going against the grain here: YTA. I get wanting to save a life, but as a fellow SD handler... Adopting a dog from a shelter will definitely increase the likelihood of a wash, which is the last thing she needs. Mixed breed and shelter dogs can make *wonderful* service animals, but they often end up being too skittish or reactive. This dog isn't going to just be a pet for her. This dog is going to be her *lifeline* to a more normal life. 

My first service dog was a shelter dog from an organization, she was great... But my second service dog I got from a breeder and trained myself and he is far superior in his skill and more attuned to me since I was able to work with the breeder and pick a pup with a bomb proof personality who worked well *for me*.

If you want to save a dog you can look into sponsoring a dog from a shelter, bit stop inserting yourself into your girlfriend's decision for *her service dog*."
dga02d,"NTA. The younger brother should NOT have been hassling the dog like that. I don't know how old that kid was, but a lot of kids know better not to kick and shove the dog.

Your mom reminds me of mine. She sounds like a narcissist so you’ll always be TA in her eyes."
dga9t3,"NTA. The other person probably just said that to let you down easy. Don’t stress about it. If there are one-sided feelings, then you are doing each other a favor by not having any relationship. If that person truly is pressuring you to be friends, (perhaps out of guilt?) then they’re being the asshole."
dgabw9,"NAH though your friend isn't entirely innocent, I wouldn't say her behavior is quite assholish. 

You came to the wedding, brought gifts, and went to the reception. You weren't obligated to stay for the whole reception. Personally I doubt the bride even cared that you left- she had a lot more to worry about. Don't sweat your friend being mad. She'll get over it and I don't think you even did anything wrong since, as you said, she had the chance to leave and chose not to."
dgagms,"NTA.

You didn't know it was permanent and had no intention of doing this purposefully.

To be honest though, it was kind of a dumb thing to do, and she's right to be pissed.

She is taking good care of a car she loves. You even said she takes it for maintenance, and she has the money to keep it maintained. She's fine. 

The fact that it's a '79 makes it an antique (anything over 25 years is often considered ""antique"" or ""classic""). It sounds like a sweet car, and your mom sounds really great. 

Old cars do funny things, sure... but it's not going to spontaneously combust. New cars break down, too. Her car is FINE. And if breaks down, she'll get it fixed.  Get over yourself. 

Who the hell are you to tell your mom to get rid of something she loves?  You have a right to voice your opinion, and you've done that. Now take your damn place.

You berated him for not being supportive, then got mad because he was irritated that you hung up on him, then continued to treat him like shit and play petty games... Silent treatment, really?

Apologize immediately and profusely for being a huge ass."

dgbtkd,"NTA

He borrowed money and also stole from his child. If he actually is sorry about that, he’ll have no qualms with paying you back.

If it happen again, and the usher won't do anything about it, ask for a refund from the cinema for your tickets instead of losing your cool. You'll feel better about yourselves and you'll get to see the movie again... hopefully with more appreciative fellow audience members."

In fact, your girlfriend is being the bad kind of selfish by implying for you to give up on something that will make you better instead of supporting you in this great chance you've been given.

You may come back when it's over and try with her again, if you feel so inclined, but you will not be given a chance to go abroad like you've been offered again. That's a much longer shot.

If that's the ultimatum you've been given, walk away. She doesn't care about you, she cares about the idea of the relationship and she's comfortable in it. Go and have an amazing time abroad."
dgcmqj,"Nta but next time, you need to send a message saying you can't go"
dgcokf,"NTA
this isn't about trust, this is your privacy. explain to him that you won't give him the password. honestly, you don't need any reasoning."
dgcq48,NTA. She's trying to cheat the reservation website and didn't give you everything the advert promised.
dgcqsi,NTA. It's your girlfriend's issue to sort out with her roommate. Presumably there are separate bedrooms involved?
dgcrje,YTA. Your parents gifted you a very expensive trip. The least you could do is partake in some activities they want to do as a way of saying thanks and showing your appreciation.
dgcut8,NTA. She asked you for advice. You told her only facts. It's not like you just gave your unasked opinion.
dgd9bp,"NTA

But you are being an asshole to *yourself* by staying with this utter leeching loser."
dgdbvs,YTA. You aren't entitled to his friends business. Respect their privacy.
dgdj5z,"NTA Dee should have asked you directly, but she didn’t because she knew it’s a big ask of the girlfriend of a distant family member."
dgdqko,"NTA

Your dad left your brother 50K, good for him. 
He left you the house. It’s 100% your decision what to do with the house. And since you sold it it’s 100% your decision what to do with YOUR money. Nice of you to help your sister out. Your brother is being a dick."
dge560,"You are NTA you're a teenager. And you're human. It was 6am not noon its reasonable to have not gotten up. 

You're living in a verbally abusive situation with adults who cant/wont take responsibility for their own actions. Your father got mad because hes an angry person not because of you.

 He will never admit that to you but he blames you to rid himself of any guilt or consequence he would face should he accept that he is TA. 

If your grandfather is any better maybe you amd the dog could just live with him? You should have to face this abuse daily. Life as a teenager trying to graduate is stressfull enough."
dge609,"NTA. We disabled people are still just people. You didn't make fun of him for being disabled, you just made fun of him like he was anyone else. That's being inclusive. People who're complaining don't know how to treat disabled people like regular people"
dge68u,NAH -- try talking to her and letting her know that it bothers you. You would be the asshole if you demanded she tie up her hair.
dge6he,Talk to your bf. This way you can know what he thinks instead of what we think.
dge76w,"NTA. You are never the asshole for staying away from toxic people. Blood doesn't mean they get to treat you terribly, or that you can never leave. Blood means they're supposed to treat you well."
dgebjn,YTA- making the kid a Chiefs fan is only setting him up for a lifetime of disappointment.
dged00,Very confused as to what kind of person let’s their kid vomit in the middle of a fast food place instead of taking them to a restroom. Also why the staff wouldn’t have said anything to her about it. NTA.
dgeesf,"Yta

Omg this is a 3 year old. Imagine if you were in your uncles shoes . Not only does the daughter of the person you have lived with for a long time hate you your brother is kicking you out of her birthday party . Stop sucking up to your 3 year old daughter ."
dgegwn,"This...something about it doesn't sound real, to me..."
dgejiw,"YTA if you havent even attempted to clean this stuff. Your story sounds sketchy to me; you had thousands of dollars of merchandise in one bag, and none of it was in packaging, was protected from the puke, or is capable of being cleaned?"
dgesdg,NTA. Their behavior is very unprofessional and it’s wasting your time. The fact that no one is taking this seriously is a big problem. It seems like you might have gotten scammed.
dgeu0q,"This is the most insane, petty, benign issue I have seen on this subreddit. ESH. Watch Kill Bill Vol. 2, if anyone says they don't want it spoiled, tell them to get out. Seriously, what in Christian hell is wrong with you guys? Just watch the damn movie for fucks sake."
dgew9n,"NTA, funerals are for the living, not the dead. If it's not going to bring you closure and comfort then there is no reason to attend. If you haven't already though, maybe consider seeing your grandmother (or talking to) and saying a sort of goodbye while she's still alive?"
dgexgf,"NAH, but fyi, wearing a mask does nothing to protect *you* from infection. Surgeons wear then to protect the patient, not themselves."
dgeyrd,"YTA starting from here:

>By choosing the destination wedding, you are letting your guests know that they are \*not\* important to you and that their attendance is \*not\* a priority.

Before that it was perfectly ok."
dgeyty,"eh.. nta.. but know that your fellow students will likely see you as ""that guy"""
dgf03n,"NTA!!! 
Your parents need to understand that you have things of your own to deal with. They can’t expect you to be a 24/7 helper just because your mother doesn’t want to get a temporary helper. I hope you can resolve this quickly. I get that you’re under a lot of stress right now. I hope it goes well."
dgf64r,"NTA - you need to completely cut him off. He needs serious help. He is self harming to keep you around. Stay far far away.


Edit: a word"
dgfdm9,NTA. You should screenshot all of this and report it to everyone he works for and is associated with. He’s a fucking creep.
dgfh2m,"Nta you pay rent you deserve not to be woken up in those hours of the night, talk to your building manager/ landlord"
dgfhw1,"NTA  


Did she give any reasons for not going?  Also, your marriage is ending anyway so why not just tell her you're taking the kids on the trip with or without her.  What's she gonna do, divorce you?"
dgfkt3,"NTA

Your grandparents should be honest with your dad. By not telling him, they are setting you up for a LOT of drama after they die, and that's not fair to you.

Your dad shouldn't be spending recklessly and counting on inheritance money to come in and fix everything. That's ridiculously irresponsible.

Everyone in this situation is an asshole other than you."
dgfqcd,"NTA your mom has same major anger issues if she's breaking down doors to get into a place where someone is sleeping. 

The only time I could ever see that being a rational thing to do, is if she perceived you to be in imminent danger
 Wtf."
dgfstk,"NAH she probably is trying in her own way to reconnect. But you’re an adult. I’d do so in a gentle way if you must. However, I have found with my mom (who also loves unsolicited advice) it’s either best to tell them “okay” and leave it at that or respond with “well I do it this way” or “this has worked for me” 

But whatever works best for you is certainly the way to go."
dgfurd,"NTA. It sounds like you and your fiance worked out your plans. Why he involved his family is beyond me. If your flying home to be with your sick grandmother, why would you fly back a couple days later. He can handle packing the boxes."
dgfv6d,"NTA. Flip the table. What if the company was relocating in two months? They’d have no issue letting you go. It’s just business. Work the job, do well, put your notice in. Standard two weeks is enough. Your rationale? “My family has had unexpected news about a new start in a town we’ve dreamed of living in.” Nothing wrong with that."
dgfvpe,"YTA. 
From the sound of it she is putting in alot of effort into this, while you are just blowing her off. I understand not wanting to or not feeling it but that doesn't mean you can just string her along. Don't be rude to her, just be firm. ""Hey i understand that you are excited for us to be best friends again but we are not who we were, we are stangers to each other. I don't feel very comfortable with how quick you are trying to jump back into the old times."" If you want to be friends ask her to take it slow, a few conversations at a time, video chat her or something. Or if you have no interest in being friends then tell her, but don't continue to blow her off like that. It is rude as hell and if the tables were turned you would be hurt that she was treating yiu that way."
dgfw4k,"NTA. You don’t owe them anything. I’m sorry you can’t legally get married, but congratulations on your partnership!"
dgfy5m,NAH. Except it's kind of shitty your friends won't help you figure out how to get involved.
dgg19h,"INFO: I'm assuming that your coworkers know that you're hard of hearing.  So if so, have you mentioned to them that you have difficulty understanding them especially in a loud environment, so they need to be clear, concise, and loud when talking to you?

If they are aware of this, NTA, because you have explained your disability to them.  You've already been discriminated against for it in previous jobs, and you've also been excluded from conversations in all aspects of life.  They're assholes if you had a conversation about this and they still choose to not be accommodating.

If they are not aware of this and/or you haven't had a conversation that you need them to speak to you in a better way, then NAH because I highly doubt they're doing this maliciously.  It's more out of ignorance but nothing personal against you."
dgg3vb,"ESH

Your relationship with your GF (Ex GF?) sounds toxic as hell.  And if you keep getting wasted and cussing people out, maybe you should stop drinking and start trying to handle your problems while you're sober."
dgg3zk,"If your worried about stuff being on your record for petty shit, don't get involved in petty shit. 

If you're gonna call someone out be damn sure you are ready for the consequences."
dgg562,"YTA. 

You fantasise and want a relationship with your brother built on a fantasy that is never going to exist so rather than the relationship you have you just want to throw it all away?

This is akin to trying to force another person to be in a relationship with you when they just want to be friends."
dgg8qq,"NTA, but your father sure is.

People who say mean things and then claim they were only joking?  Those people are assholes."
dggcrv,"YTA.

Doesn’t really matter whether they use the money for a skateboard or not you broke their property so you pay its value to them in the form of cash or a new product.

I also don’t really understand how you though stepping on a plastic kids skateboard as a fully grown adult was going to end."
dggd53,"NTA. I’m sorry, but your dad is a fucking monster. GO VISIT YOUR DONKEY FRIEND."
dgge75,"NTA her calling you a “fun-sucker” shows that she was expecting you to pay, When obviously you don’t have the money. If she really wanted to do that she could finance it herself, And It really sounds like she is taking advantage of you and you should stop giving her money especially since you have barely any yourself"
dgggg6,"NTA - but I perceive you’re asking for more advice than an asshole or not rating.

My advice would be - talk to your boss about this before talking to HR. Get their perspective."
dgggti,NTA he doesn’t pay rent or do anything toward helping with the bills. He wouldn’t let you eat the groceries he bought so it’s only fair he doesn’t benefit from the things you have. Your roommate should absolutely not give him a spare key.
dggh97,"YTA clearly didn’t communicate with him you wanted him to plan, you plan it last minute and who has a Bach party on a Wednesday lol"
dggjjk,"YTA you knew what the procedures were when you shopped there. It was your own mistake that caused this problem and you won't own up to it. Having to wait for them to print a new receipt for you wouldn't have taken that long, and now you definitely look like you were stealing something. I'm sorry your wife had to deal with that. Also, you're setting a fantastic example for your kids that the rules don't apply to them."
dggktm,"NTA.  I suspect something is going on related to therapy.  Possibly something your friend realized about herself, and now she is overcorrecting."
dggnj1,"NAH - It's your problem to deal with, and you should deal with it however makes sense for you, but you also can't necessarily expect him to go along with it when HE isn't comfortable with it."
dggoik,"YTA

Every other weekend is such a small amount of time to see your dad and your boyfriend has the chance to be there for her. I get your disappointment, but if you force him to choose between you and his five-year-old, he should choose her!"
dggp6z,"YTA - good lord, she's not your nurse, she's your girlfriend. You can take care of yourself for a little while"
dggpkb,"YTA. 

Your entire reasoning for not wanting to go now is because you'll be indoors eating turkey with people that you'd otherwise be ok with outdoors eating hamburgers with."
dggpu0,"NTA

And I don't believe this dog is going to go to her mom's after a month either."
dggqr0,"I have 60 euros in my bank account, I can’t relate to your problems at all. 

To me YTA for sharing your horrible rich person problems"
dggr90,"NTA

They expect that a large majority of their invitees won’t be able to show up - that’s part of having a destination wedding, especially an expensive one.

It would have been rude and probably hurtful to decline at that point. At least now you have all the info and can send along a card near that date to congratulate them."
dggrdm,"NTA. 
That would annoy the hell out of me."
dggs3o,"NAH. He asked, you said no, he moved on. I don't see why this is even a post to be honest."
dggwd2,"NTA. If he was really trying to rebuild the relationship he shouldn't have ambushed you like that. This isn't just about ""We won't be here for long."" It's the fact that he purposefully withheld the information about where you were going from you. I assume he didn't tell you because he knew you'd be uncomfortable with it in the first place, and he was hoping that you'd just go along with it because of the last minute pressure. He needs to sort out his own priorities if he's going to try to make this relationship work"
dggwy8,"NTA

I'm sure Jen's parents are happy to have an honest opinion of the town they're considering moving to."
dgh26s,[deleted]
dgh9w7,"NTA, but I would suggest you check that the coaches have in fact gotten with this guy specifically as opposed to these generalized email bulletins, before you go above their heads. But if they have and this man is a problem? Go right ahead."
dghfyz,NTA - You're not her mother. She can speak up about her own dietary needs. BK has veggie burger options if i recall correctly.
dghgmp,"If you can't share it with your partner, why have it up for public consumption? 

Verdict: YTA"
dghgvt,"YTA

1. Midnight is too late to call
2. You could have waited with her so the whole ""oh no, poor alone female"" argument is kinda lame
3. You could have planned this out in advance"
dghlvm,"ESH

She shouldn't have taken your drink but dude, don't kick people."
dghmhs,"YTA

Declining to cook meat is a reasonable limit for a vegetarian. She was willing to help you, you could have suggested a meat free option or, if you were so hungry, eat something your dad prepared.

Your sister doesn't owe you a meal with meat."
dghnf8,"YTA.  If someone is sold a stolen car, they still have to return it once that is discovered.  Just because they became annoying doesn't make you keeping something you know was stolen any more right"
dghsvd,"ESH. his mom and your boyfriend should not allow him to live this way and should have more expectations of him. That being said, you should be discussing this with your boyfriend just the two of you and he should be the one dealing with his brother and mom. Nothing should come from you directly. It’s his family not yours. I get how hard it is because I have issues with my in laws. But not your monkey, not your circus so to soeak"
dghug8,"NTA

She let you know that your relationship isn’t important to her. No reason to continue investing in it."
dghwhx,NTA.  This is not a child-friendly building.  She should take that into consideration and look to move to a place that's more appropriate for families.
dghxsl,Ehhh light YTA. You have these lunches monthly. You’re essentially feeding your wife to the wolves. You’re a partnership and is it really that hard to miss one lunch for the sake of having your partners back?
dghzgw,"NTA - It's incredibly easy to become accustomed to the bullshit that is a job saying 'you're leaving us hanging in the wind' and feel bad but the University clearly doesn't care about your department and won't until something fully breaks.

Use your sick days, take your FMLA, and leave them hanging!"
dgi2z8,Nta. He called you a liar unprovoked.
dgi8pu,"NAH - just because he's nice and a good friend doesn't mean you need to put yourself in a position that I imagine would cause a lot of anxiety. I'm sure he'd understand

That said, it does sound temporary, is there any compromise that would be acceptable for you? Like limiting the rooms that the dog is allowed to be in or maybe you split days/weeks having the dog with another friend or something like that

If you can accept something like that, tell him that you'll do it if no one else is able to take him"
dgi9ba,"NTA, you’re allowed to have a history."
dgi9lp,"Eh....ESH.

His behavior wasn't appropriate *at all*, she should have told him to knock it the fuck off, and although you had good intentions there's a better way to handle the situation."
dgib9n,"NTA - You're not responsible for your friend's toxic friendships, you are not required to be in a performative friendship."
dgiblq,"NTA. From what I understand, he used a racial slur and then attempted to avoid consequences by tossing it up to the brain damage he has suffered. 

As a 60 year old man, he is accountable for his own actions. All of them. Unless he is truly unable to control the words coming out of his mouth, he needs to take responsibility for what he said, not worm his way out of it through a doctor's note."
dgidmm,"NTA like, at all. You were quiet and didn’t make a scene, and that’s enough respect. The work place is not the place for your coworker to bring religion into it. So the person leading the prayer is out of lines in my opinion. If others were glancing and giving disapproving looks, then they were also disrespectful for not “fully participating”. And the coworker who said you were in the wrong is actually wrong for expecting you to participate in something you don’t agree with."
dgifha,"I'm going to lean towards NTA.

Your fam are obviously assholes, but if your boyfriend is okay with sharing then it's okay. As someone from a family that's shitty to my lovely partner you don't need to cater towards their whims"
dgig20,"NAH, bless you and your social awkwardness. You’re under no obligation to take anyone but I apart from the extra 20 minute drive I don’t get why you wouldn’t want to."
dgihu7,"YTA, let her have fun with it. If she's not good enough, she'll find out on her own."
dgim9z,"NAH. Of course they want to have sleep overs, but it's okay for you to say no, too. 

I will say, do keep in mind that they are going to have sex somewhere. Not allowing sleep overs in your home won't keep them from having sex. But that doesn't mean you have to make it easier. It is risky for them, after all."
dgiob8,"NTA. It's weird to invite a guest to someone else's place without permission, and doubly so if the person isn't even there.

You don't know this person at all. It's even worse if they hooked up."
dgiu2v,"YTA and it's shocking to me that you could ever come to any other conclusion. 

A) You're entire basis for disliking her is that she's attractive. Let me repeat. **You're entire basis for disliking her is that she's attractive.** 

B) You (rudely) blew a tinder date just because you wanted the opportunity trash Tori who has done nothing but be attractive around you. 

C) you hid behind 'just being honest' when your gossiping got back to her as if you'd been upfront instead of

D) pretending to be her friend for years while harbouring this huge rage boner 

E) Then you call her 'bitchy and aggressive' for calling you out 'in front of the whole team' despite just confronting you on your own behaviour. Hey, she was just 'being honest'.   


For some reason, you've fixated all your frustration onto this person. Maybe girl's like Tori have treated you badly in the past. Maybe you initially liked her but knew she'd shoot you down. Maybe you just resent that good looking people have an easier go of it than the rest of us. Here's the thing though: **she hasn't done anything to you.** You let your anger towards her ruin a date and you're about to let it ruin your friendships. Because let's be clear: people don't pick their friends based on seniority. It doesn't matter how long you've been on the team. They're going to side with the person that is a) pleasant to be around and b) didn't do anything wrong

So **apologise**. Because this isn't worth losing everyone over. If you continue down this path don't blame Tori that your friends ice you out. It'll be on you."
dgixsj,NTA. Don't lie. Period.
dgixyk,"NTA

Talk to your landlord.  U need 24 hour notice before his friend shows up. Also if he wants respect he needs to show it"
dgiy3l,"NTA

Distance yourself from her, and beware others like her. 

Also, helping people is kind, but there's a difference between guiding and doing their work for them. You'll want to find study partners that understand reciprocity and genuinely make an effort."
dgizdw,"NTA. Firm and complete NTA. Your body, your choice. He’s not the one who would have had to carry it for 9 months and pregnancy can be expensive and carries at lot of risks. 

You did what was right for you. NTA a thousand times over."
dgj0iz,"ESH

Don't be friends with him if he sucks.  Otherwise be nice to your friends.

Edit: He is also 13.  Kids are stupid.  You'll look back on yourself in 5 years and just shake your head."
dgj1jd,"NTA

Sounds like a mental health issue in his part. Your options are only boundaries for protecting you and your family."
dgj3i6,"Sounds to me like he had no idea what his computer was worth until his friends say something along the lines of ""You sold it for how much?!""

Seems like this is a life experience that he will learn from. He made a sale he deals with the consequences. NTA.

Edit: I would however, at least respond to the guy and decline the suggestion, not just leave him hanging."
dgj4iy,"I don't really have a judgement for this one... Personally I think he should suck it up to support you.

But I find it odd that, for someone who's apparently camera shy/anxious, you don't seem to be respecting his own anxieties."
dgj4uf,"NTA, it takes two participants to have a conversation. If he wants to talk, all he has to do is respond."
dgj7q2,"NTA. They aren't looking out for the safety of their clients.

As an aside, you mentioned you could sue if you were in the US. I'm not a lawyer, but to my knowledge in the US, normally you need to have gotten a more serious injury like a concussion or broken arm in order to get any good money out of suing for something like that."
dgj81z,"NTA. Basically what you said in the last sentence...you weren't invited, so you made plans, and that's that. If your GF is hurt by this, then she needs to know that's a CONSEQUENCE of them changing their minds last minute and not your fault. Life has consequences."
dgje60,"NTA.

You had every right to call out their racist behavior and comments."
dgjeo4,"ESH. This one is situational. If you're not working then yeah, you should be responsible for the house. He has no right to make you a servant and should understand you were out for the day. So if he's working and you're not, the house is 100% yours right now (as in dishes, laundry, etc). If he's like eating a sandwich on the couch and leaves his trash for you, then that's just unreasonable and unfair."
dgjezs,"NTA - Your concerns are very valid. Moving in only because ""signing a lease is not ideal"" is a TERRIBLE reason to rush things. Not even going to touch the issue with his kids. That could be trouble as well.

Just be careful how you approach things with her as you don't want seen as trying to come between them."
dgjgap,"YTA for accepting their money and not paying them back. Why are you okay with taking money from your housemates, but not from your own parents?"
dgjjgb,Yta the world doesn’t revolve around you. Best the learn that sooner than later.
dgjrwp,"NTA. Your mother is being emotionally abusive to both you and your sister. That she blames your sister for being abused is abhorrent enough, but that she would attack you over being depressed makes her even lower. You and your sister deserve a better mother, but since that won't happen, I'd suggest going to r/raisedbynarcissists to get some tools on how to deal with yours. Grey rocking would be a good skill for you to start using. I am truly sorry you have to deal with that woman."
dgjtxp,YTA you worded that way because you wanted it to hurt. Cruel of you and if you don’t think you’re an ass you’re dense  af or a troll lol
dgjybp,"NAH but I really understand her discomfort. I imagine she already feels a lot like a third wheel in the apartment and now she even gets evicted from her bed.

I wouldn't push to make her sleep in the twin."
dgk0ta,"Your roommate is committing crimes left and right, potentially implicating you as an accomplice, endangering you on a daily basis, and your problem is tidiness?????"
dgk4ip,"ESH. It takes 2 people to walk into each other, both didn't look or step aside."
dgk74h,"You’re definitely NTA. 100%. That being said, if you continue to do that to these people, I see significant car/tire damage in your very near future."
dgk79q,"YTA but only because of your response to being asked to be a part of it, not because you didn’t want to go. There are a LOT better ways of communicating than the way you did."
dgkb70,ESH  Why are you getting more cats if you've got a cat chucker in the house?
dgkesy,NTA but maybe don't plan meetings on a Friday afternoon. That would piss me right off
dgkgu6,"YTA. You're being petty and passive aggressive for no reason. I personally love well-done steak, and my boyfriend teases me and makes fun of me for the ""hockey puck"" steaks he makes when he makes steak for us all of the time. You don't get to dictate someone else's food preferences, and trying to strong arm him into liking food the way you like it is just weird. He doesn't want his steak well-done, get over it. Why not give him some of yours, if you wanted him to try it that badly, instead of trying to force him into making his whole steak the way you like it?"
dgkj08,"If you have concrete evidence, NTA. She deserves to know."
dgkl3c,NTA and actually this is your parents fault not your sisters.
dgkoms,"If it's the last one YWBTA. If it s your daughter who was the last one there, would you want her to wait there by herself?"
dgkq3y,NTA. He had a responsibility to make sure those animals were taken care of while he was gone and he neglected to do so. You were nice enough to think about them in the first place without being asked. The most you can do now is apologize for trying to help and try to come up with a solution in the event they are both gone for a period of time again that works for everyone.
dgkqgx,"~~I-NFO: How old is he?~~

Edit: He's 23, so YTA. He's old enough to decide for himself.

PS: Just so you know, your comparison doesn't make sense. Boycotting a restaurant and boycotting a country are completely different things."
dgkzln,I think you need /r/legaladvice.
dgl1bq,"NAH- she’s just trying to be nice and you’re trying to be nice in fact, ESA (everybody seems amazing)"
dgl1m2,"It depends a little on the job. Does it take a couple of month to learn YTA. If it is just a job you can do without them investing a lot of time and effort to teach you i’d say it doesn’t matter. Btw, where in europe are you going to study?"
dgl2wa,"YTA, I get why you're frustrated but he was still on a phone call. It wasn't like he was chatting with a friend. You have to let this one go."
dglah2,"NTA

But why is she calling you for money if you don't know each other very well? Possibly an indication that people that know her better declined to loan her the money as well...."
dglamm,NTA because ditching all the people working on the show for one of the last rehearsals would be an asshole move.
dglc2w,This feels like a validation post
dglc3s,NTA - it sounds like you are still a minor aka not an adult so it is not on you to raise those kids. It sucks what happened but it's not on you - your step-mom and dirtbag sperm donor screwed up. If you had stayed it would have also impacted you - you have to live your life.
dglcxh,NTA. Situations like this are why leases are able to be broken.
dglh4m,"NTA, Amanda is an adult and can make her own choices."
dgli9q,YTA. You told somebody you wouldn't do X. That was a condition of her moving in. You did X. You broke the vow you made.
dglk3z,"NTA

It's totally possible to be friends with one of your exes. But if she's gotten mad at you in the past for it (even if you weren't really), then she's being a hypocrite.

And don't be afraid to talk to her. Your feelings matter, and if she's not understanding, do yourself a favor and bail."
dglm41,Kind of sounds like they know each other from somewhere. That's just a guess though.
dglnsm,"NTA

Fuck his brother for being an immature little shit"
dgloq7,NTA your mother is strange
dglq34,"NAH- there’s no reason to go into every grimy sexual encounter you have ever had.  Being open with your spouse dose not need full disclosure, especially if it is a painful memory you don’t want to think about."
dglrkb,NTA. Group projects are the worst.
dglspj,YTA. One fart escaped. That’s uncontrollable but then you sat there. On top of him. Laughing. And *repeatedly* farting on him again and again. The continuing to do it is what makes you TA
dglsq1,"NAH, but you’re being very selfish. Does she have access to a vehicle while you’re at work to even get out of the house?"
dglw2k,Where's the party? Its in our minds
dglz56,"NTA - not at all man, your friend is acting .. interesting. Kinda sounds like she likes the attention or pity they get from asking for food. 

You did the right thing though. You saw your friend going to school without any food so you worried about them and tried to help them out. That's nice, your friend should be more appreciative."
dgm0rj,"Yta.  He is 7. If you just said ""I am in here"" he would have stopped and all this BS avoided."
dgm1nf,"NTA. She can ask for help, but she’s not entitled to it. Everyone goes through crap and still has to take care of responsibilities. Either suck it up or go to therapy, but she has to take care of her own stuff."
dgm44o,"NAH for asking them about it..

Having a rational discussion seems like the most acceptable thing to do in this situation"
dgm4uy,"NTA, however i think reddit is not the best place to ask for advice on what to do considering your dad is old school eastern european.

What redditors think is the right thing might create some problems in your home and with your dad, which you are too young to deal with right now."
dgm9tf,Obviously NTA.  She should be better at reading who wants to chat.
dgm9w1,"Nta.  If she is miserable, she can move."
dgmblz,"YTA,  FFS she made a mistake and it's $25 that won't put you out. Don't keep a friendship spreadsheet."
dgmcwb,NTA. You are an adult and are living life as you see fit. You aren't lying to them. It's not their business.
dgmg0m,NTA. This is a perfect example of why working with family can be problematic! I strongly suggest getting another job (if possible) ASAP. If she does this once and you cave she's probably going to do it again.
dgmkm5,"YTA

How did you expect your daughter to safely learn how drive without ANY form of teaching? Hope that the driving fairy blessed her on some fateful day? Maybe she'd wake up one morning with perfect driving knowledge? Was she to go on a quest to find the scroll of driving only to realize in was in her all along??"
dgmpgd,NAH. But maybe once in a while ask if you can invite Emma. You never know they might hit it off.
dgmze8,"NTA, but don't abandon him. I know it's not you who's being distant about it, but if you hold your stance and he stops talking to you, you've let her cut you out of his life and made him more alone. 

Try telling him you don't want to be around her without him. You'd prefer not to hang out with her, but you'll do it if he's also there. Start calling her out when she's abusing him. When they're arguing and she accuses him of yelling, pipe up and tell her that he hasn't said anything. Start keeping a record of the things she does. When she gaslights him, when she abuses him. Write down the date and time and a description. We tend to let little things slide and don't realize they've become a habit. Show him exactly what she's doing and how often.

He needs all his friends in his corner. I know it sucks to watch it happen to a friend (I'm literally watching the same thing happen to my friend right now) but you can't let him go through it alone."
dgn1k2,"NAH

As far as I’m concerned you can have your party wherever you want, but if you’re expecting people to pay for their own meals you shouldn’t be surprised if they don’t show up to pay for a meal they don’t want. I can’t imagine many vegans being thrilled about being invited to an expensive place that primarily serves meat and dairy. Sure, they can find something on the menu, but would you but it’s understandable for them to opt out. 

Also, just a side note, if you’re going to move the party to a place that’s a lot more expensive (that’s not obviously going to be that way) than normal it’s a nice gesture to mention that when you invite them. Don’t make them ask."
dgnjro,YTA if you're keeping other people up all night when talking to your gf. Go outside or sit in a car or something while talking to her.
dgnm7k,YTA it may be illegal but that doesn’t mean it’s harmful. Just tell them it smell bothers you  and ask them to ventilate a little better. Why do you feel the need to get them in legal trouble?
dgnok9,"YTA. Yeah you can stay longer, but it’s a couples trip. It’s kind of harsh to just send her home on her home and stay on yourself."
dgnqju,"NAH. Just talk to him. Tell him that you still care about him as a friend, but sometimes get uncomfortable with comments about your looks and whatnot. Explain that you know he doesn't mean it in any flirty way, but you're still new to this and am trying to figure out how to handle it. It's your own problem that you have to work through, but explaining the situation to him will make it easier for the both of you."
dgnxew,"ESH 

Start taking smoke breaks. You don't have to smoke yo take a smoke break."
dgo6pt,YTA respect her boundaries.
dgo8oz,"YTA. She's not a plot of land you can stake claim too. There's also going to be othe people she talks to and other people interested in her. You gonna have quiet words with them too?

She has opinions and a choice of who she talks to herself which you've not even cared to consider.

Also yes you are being insecure and jealous over your friend even talking to the girl you like.
It's an unhealthy attitude and you're best nipping it in the bud now, whilst you're young."
dgo9ug,"NAH. You can't dictate what kind of funeral he should have, but you can tell them how much you're comfortable contributing and leave it at that."
dgobdy,"YTA

There are other people in the building. Be responsible and use one washer and one dryer at a time max. Don't screw other people over because you forgot to do multiple loads of laundry."
dgoc3a,"NTA - She makes you miserable, it’s as simple as that. Of course you’re not an asshole."
dgoekj,NTA but I would just let it go and chalk it up as a lesson learned.
dgoiyh,"ESH- you for bringing home a completely random woman whilst having a girlfriend, your girlfriend for making threats of cheating and the girl for kicking her friend out in favour of a guy she just met. 

Even though your intentions were nice with the other girl you have to have seen that it seems odd to take a random woman to your home? How would you feel if your girlfriend had told you that she invited a stranger man back to her home?"
dgok99,"YWBTA. That's a pain and in many places tips go into a pool to be split so you could be stiffing everyone involved. 

Don't get me wrong it's cool but also I wouldn't want it."
dgons3,"NTA, but you're in the wrong because you're expecting one person to fix what is obviously a systemic issue. In my experience shitty employees don't just miraculously appear overnight, they need shitty managers who allow or even condone their behavior. You're trying to chop down a tree and thinking it'll turn a forest into a beach, it won't. You can't change people and you definitely can't change a whole company, all you can do is change your employer and make tracks."
dgou4r,"I'm gonna have to go NAH here tbh. I don't blame your boyfriend for being mad, this is a pretty big award. But also something that reminds you of unhappier times. Some may think it's silly, but we really cannot help how we feel and the connections we make to the objects around us. You have been supportive, and this award is something that you at least tried to live with for a while before realizing you couldn't. Is there someplace he can move it to that would still be in the public eye, but where you often don't go? Like his place of work or something? I can definitely see why he wouldn't want to just move it to the basement or storage."
dgoxlz,"NTA. Also, wtf. Kay has some serious growing up to do.

""I don't want to be around anyone I don't like"" ? 

Seriously? How is this person getting through life without being around people she doesn't click with? 

If I had a dollar for every time I need to be around people I don't like I'd have a slow but steady additional income."
dgoyp5,Well while fondant looks nice it tastes like shit so she has the right idea !
dgoyz6,"NTA. Keep living your life. If you're slamming stuff around and playing loud music that's one thing, but you're not. No need to neglect your chores."
dgp095,"NTA- It’s your home, your rules. And he’s acting like a child. No reasonable adult would throw a tantrum because you didn’t do them a favor"
dgp3gw,"NTA- Your friendship didn’t end because of the joke, it ended because your “friend” tried to get you in serious trouble for something that was not your fault. You are right to be upset and not want to involve yourself with someone who would do that."
dgp4yd,"I openly admit my bias here. I watched my grandfather go from ""oh you poor thing"" to ""you lazy bastard"" within a few months.

Your father cannot eat. This is the most basic of life sustaining requirements, and it affects him on every level. Studies show that the free breakfast and lunch program gives kids so much extra brain power, they can raise their grades within a few months.

So when your dad says he can't do anything, think about his situation. Think about the fact that his body is starving him- is punishing him when he eats. This is incredibly difficult.

That's not to say your mom is having a cake walk. She needs support. She should reach out to doctors, other family members, and support forums.

You mean well, and you probably didn't know all this, so I'm saying NAH."
dgpa7j,"YTA. 

You are upset that they didn't drive a 6-hour round trip so that they could spend an hour talking to you? Seriously? That might be appropriate if you are 6. Not when you're 18 and living away from home.

It would be okay if you were a little bit disappointed that they didn't plan better. But crying all day long and refusing their weekly phone call? Grow up."
dgpf43,"YTA. I don't understand why you just guessed how much longer you'd be working there.

>the new girl (who was very cute btw)

Dude. Not relevant."
dgpn7u,"NTA 

If you ask him not to email. But if the assignment is done find a diner with wifi and send it."
dgpnug,They aren't asking anything of you or putting you out. They seem to want minimal time with their grandchildren but still want some. So a soft YTA just because I dont think they've done anything to deserve being completely cut off.
dgptpj,"NTA. I mean is this going to become a thing? We will have to make accommodations for anyone who wants to do anything? 

Can I play for the Celtics? I suck at basketball, but I’d like to be on the team."
dgpxn2,"NAH, from a guy’s perspective the best thing you can do in this situation is give a yes or no answer. By telling him what you said, it’s sending a mixed signal. I’d much rather hear a “No, Boyfriend, that would make me uncomfortable. Please don’t do that” over a “No, but it’s your decision” or similar answer."
dgq0jx,"NAH, as long as you were kind and patient with her, which it sounds like you were. She was upset, and frustrated with herself, not with you. She was struggling greatly in something that the rest of your group seemed to fully understand and probably felt like a insecure about herself. Taking the time to try to help her understand what is going on does not make you an asshole, and feeling insecure does not make her an asshole."
dgq1np,NAH. You didn't do it on purpose; it was an accident caused by two people not paying attention to their surroundings.
dgq1wf,"NAH -- I think it's common for roommates to comingle dishes and kitchenwares, so your roommates aren't being TA for using your things. It's also okay, whether it's reasonable or not, to feel squicked out by them using your stuff. I think it would be best for you to start keeping your kitchenwares in your room, though. If it's in common space, it should be for everyone to use, I would think."
dgq5dk,"NTA. What a fucking ingrate. You sound so gracious, making room for her despite your living situation, paying for her taxi, ticket, driving her around, giving her a phone, like! Can *I* stay with you?! Lol. And in return you got *that.* Wow. So sorry. NTA."
dgqe08,ESH.  Take the bus and tell your relative to download Uber.
dgqhit,"NTA,
But, to make a comment about something else in the post

>He says he’s not sure if we can afford it but if the breeder can offer us a deal then maybe we can swing it.

Is probably not a great place to be. If you are having doubts about being able to afford both, it's best to just get one that you know you will be able to properly afford. Anyway, sorry for the unwanted advice, ur NTA"
dgqisw,AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
dgqp6q,"**NTA**. Regardless of the cultural context, they’re clearly exploiting you."
dgqs6m,NAH- for asking. They certainly don’t have to agree. If you don’t like it talk to the boss.
dgqx3q,YTA for saying it like you did.
dgqyo6,NTA. Cutting toxic people out of your life is super healthy.
dgr1ff,"NTA
Humans don’t own each other."
dgr22x,"NTA. As someone who also did 23 and Me, and also AncestryDNA and MyHeritage (adopted at birth), the other person can also see you on their list. Go ahead and message them, just know that they may not even see it, so don't be offended if you don't get a response!"
dgr4lw,"NTA
Boss shouldn’t have mentioned it if were going to train more.  That’s a big burden. 

I sorta feel bad for her bc it is true that some people are very bright, only take notes, never say a word (Clarence Thomas);  while others never say a word bc they’re struggling to comprehend and keep up. 
Hope she gets tested or evaluated somehow before fired."
dgr573,YTA. You knew she was self conscious about it and then you make that comment. Being drunk isn’t an excuse.
dgrb8c,"They can't enforce that. They can refuse entry after the start time, but not block exits unless hazard are outside or some special circumstance. Just stay till you see all the people you want and leave. What are they going to do take attendance? lol

NTA"
dgrroi,"YTA

4 additional hours of driving weighed against what will likely be an indeterminate length of time for your spouse to defrost.

Spouse's mistake? Yes. Your fault? No.

Then again, splitting the driving over the four hours, and making the best of it. Spending time together, and finding humor in the situation.

vs

Spouse making the drive alone. Stewing in anger and frustration. Irritation at herself for forgetting the items, replaying the course of events...remembering that originally the plan was to use her car.

The hotel would still be used, and you'd still attend the celebration, but making the trip with her was a great opportunity to bond with your wife, make lemonade from lemons, and go above and beyond.

Personally, I tend to take the long view. What's MOST likely to be the thing that stands out to her about this trip in the years to come? Is she going to remember that you bought the hotel and planned the trip? Or is she going to recall feeling embarrassed and making the trip alone?

Your priorities may be different and that's fine. This is a situation where your actions are technically without fault...but technically right is a far cry from feeling emotionally at peace with a given course of action."
dgrvov,"NTA 

He needs to ask her himself. It's cheesy and creepy to ask a kid to help you get a date."
dgrx34,NTA. You would actually be an idiot to not do this and invite drama into your life.
dgs3t6,NTA. Fuck those people
dgs4iq,NTA. Fuck em. Make sure you get your check though.
dgs58b,"NTA - bro he needs something more than milk

Edit: He is WAY too old to be doing stuff like that. Because of his age he committed a crime by breaking your laptop screen and your sisters phone."
dgsb0o,"ESH

You both sound miserable to be around. I hope your neighbors didn't have to listen to your bickering"
dgse3z,"They blamed my mother for her not flying out to visit him, even though he is the main source of income between them and didn’t ever give her the money to fly out to him. They never said anything about the woman he chose to cheat on my mother with.. Maybe I should’ve added this, but he(my father) stopped paying the house payments(they make together) and I’ve been dipping into my savings to pay the house off for my mom. But at the same time, this post is about my grandparents and not my dad himself so I didn’t feel like I needed to add that in.."
dgshw8,"YTA - that was an extraordinarily arrogant and patronising thing to do.

Think of the worst thing anyone ever did to you. Now imagine someone else patting you on the head and telling you you're being childish and unreasonable for not being over it.

Are you this insensitive and pushy in other areas of your life?"
dgsitz,"NTA

I don’t want this to sound unnecessarily harsh for you OP, but he’s dead, he doesn’t give a damn about a party he’s not here to attend. I think he’d care more about his kid eating."
dgsl40,NTA - it’s the same as an empty movie theater and someone sitting right in front of you
dgsmiq,NTA- your phone number shouldn't be given out to anyone without your permission
dgsqox,"Idk man. I think you should be allowed to watch your show, but come on man shes your partner. She probably is excited to talk about her day and has no one else to talk about it with.

Years down the line, your tv shows wont matter, but the connection you have with your wife will. 

And tbh, by continuing to do this, even tho it might seem small to you, is just pushing her away from you, and maybe that connection with your wife will be gone."
dgssfm,I would never ask a roommate who pays to live somewhere to pay more for a hotel. YTA
dgsuys,NTA. Guy was being an asshole.
dgsxqw,"NTA. And your mother should be encouraging your brother to send out applications himself, not trying to get you to do the work for him. You can always say that your work has a policy on nepotism and you don't want to violate it."
dgsz7q,"NTA, he published wrong facts on YT and you corrected him. He is overreacting."
dgszm6,Why do you even need to ask? Come on bro.
dgt3zy,They sound awful and your dad sounds weak as piss. NTA
dgt8sw,"NTA, some people truly aren't worth your time, and J sounds like one of them if he feels compelled to call you out over something he felt doesn't fully understand."
dgtc08,"NTA

While I can imagine being a step parent can be really difficult, she's gone about this completely the wrong way. It sounds like even your dad has had enough of her too. 

I'm glad he stuck up for you and refused the cruise."
dgtd1j,"NTA (although may need more details).

I love that she was yelling at you for crying and then she started crying."
dgtelc,NTA. I find it weird you go and stay at the hotel with her in the first place tbh.
dgthgh,"NTA, but just say sorry, pretend to be her friend (otherwise you risk isolating yourself from your other friends) and then cut her out of your life when you leave school."
dgthub,NTA.  Your dad is who raised you and he had no involvement in your life.
dgtqpe,"NAH. But you're absolutely right that you need to have all of the uncomfortable discussions before having kids. A marriage/relationship counselor can be a neutral place to discuss these topics. I'm not sure that you'll change his lazy nature, though, you're right. If he's naturally inclined to lay around all day, that's not going to get better when he's sleep-deprived and emotionally exhausted from dealing with children all the time. Healthy habits don't suddenly develop when you have kids - that's hilariously opposite."
dgts6t,"YTA.  She's on minimum wage, topped up by benefits because even the government thinks she doesn't have enough to live on, and you want $80 that she hadn't budgeted for because she's not psychic and wouldn't know you would be requesting that extra cash.  

She didn't even turn you down. She is willing to go into debt to provide this for you and your response is to criticize her financial acumen? Talk about entitled asshole-ism."
dgty7v,"Then your SO is TA. 8 months pregnant, swollen feet and struggles walking for extended periods of time. How is this even an issue? It makes NO sense for you to go."
dgtyzt,[deleted]
dgu0u4,"NTA,your hubs is engaging in avoidance behavior.He seems to just be a lazy ahole.Why do you let him engage in this kind of juvenile behavior"
dgu3ed,"NTA, it is a dick move. Don’t bother doing anything about it though. Just tell her it is a dick move and that’s it. Also, next time tell her that the onus is on her to find someone to fill the ticket, not B."
dgu4a8,"NAH - I think your wife's reaction is coming from a place of fear, if your sister's kids needed cancer treatment, would you rob your child of his future and go into debt? By taking a bullet for your niblings, you would leave your own child fatherless? You aren't an asshole if your answers are yes, but you might have different priorities, and your wife might be realizing that she thought she had an equal partner in providing for your child's future and now she's scared you're going to split the college fund 3 ways and spend your retirement account taking care of your sister."
dgu7sw,"NTA.

He gave you money he owed you, albeit not enough, he still owes you money so he has no right to demand it back. 

If you had the money spare when he demanded it I'd have given it him and told him his ticket is being sold, whilst expressing my frustration at not being paid back. 

But you don't have the money so even that isn't an option for you."
dgu9bi,NTA.  It’s a bit insulting to offer flower girl when her family members have important roles.
dgu9jx,"NTA - if he can’t take someone asking him to act like an adult in the workplace, forget him. You’re better off."
dgubdg,"ESH, you definitely should not have sped up, I mean wouldn't he have let you in anyway? 

But a fifty year old male security guard should have more sense then to run up on a woman in a dark parking garage. I mean, most of us train for this shit from an early age- make sure we have our keys out, between the fingers, personal alarms or taeke whistles, being aware of our surroundings, etc. 

Maybe you can apologize for speeding up and explain to him how he scared the crap out of you, and you can both learn something."
dguenj,"NTA

For some reason people see babies as bandaids instead of humans.  You are the onlybperson she actually needs for now and the only people you need are the ones you know will be supportive."
dgught,"ESH you missed the messages and are saying that nobody mentions you, which in fact isn't true. But at the same time he shouldn't get angry at you for missing a few messages and leaving a chat dull of pretty much strangers to you."
dguk0s,NTA. Georgia was given the option to leave with you. She choose not to.
dgukqt,"NTA, but your in-laws are HUGE AHs. What makes them think that your parents are obligated to offer any money?"
dgul9f,[deleted]
dgulj4,"Your husband should be standing up for you. This whole situation is just ridiculous. Someone needs to cut this idiot off. It should be your husband, more than you. You are NTA for telling your husband he's not welcome."
dguott,YTA- those aren’t “masculine” traits and you come off as extremely sexist. I’d avoid you in general let alone if you were by brother who just told me I looked ugly
dgus0l,NTA the company can take legal action if they found you doing something they pay their employees for
dgusbx,"NTA, you were under no obligation to get the kitten from Lilo, also it sounds like you were supporting someone local, not some big puppy/kitty mill, she has no right to call them ""the worst of human filth."""
dgut49,[deleted]
dguuf9,"NTA. If you really are his best friend, part of your job is to tell him when he's being an idiot, not just go along with whatever he wants. Getting married again a few months after a divorce is asinine."

Once a year is a good amount for family photos, but once every several months? That's unrealistic."
dguz2z,"YTA next time just be honest, ffs. Just tell them you can't hang, you've got too much work. Ignoring and lying (saying you were almost done when you were nowhere close) are obviously asshole moves."
