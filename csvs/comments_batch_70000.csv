dhio14,NTA Is she expecting everyone to give her rides everywhere when she travels as a family? That's odd. Is there no public transportation?
dhip6u,"> maybe I have a problem, maybe I’m addicted to sex or pornography, this are question I don’t have the answers to

These might be questions you should find out the answer to. 3-4 times a day is a LOT of sex, even for the beginning of a relationship. And correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like at least once you were watching porn on your phone while in her company? Also, live cams are not the same as regular porn given the interaction component and I'm not surprised she's upset about those especially if it's a recurring issue.

I'm gonna say YTA because it does sound like you have a real problem and you seem to be aware that might be the case, so get evaluated and get some help if you need it."
dhipqr,NTA. You're allowed to make noise in your apartment.
dhirwi,"YTA, obviously. You moved away from your children and started a new life without them, and then have the audacity to get upset that they resent you for it. You don’t think the 18 and 17 year olds you abandoned needed you as much as your 5 year old does?"
dhitby,"NTA

What the hell...she purchased a gift for herself, not you."
dhivxy,[deleted]
dhiwcu,NTA because she could have been a big girl and used her big girl words to let you know she was intending to get them and was only waiting for someone to come reach them for her.
dhiwjl,NTA surely it's disrespecting her religion more if you pray even though you don't believe in it?
dhiyn5,"NTA - As a person who grew up with a father who was *a bad person*, **morally, and ethically**, but not abusive, or necessarily criminal, I understand. I don't want my father in my, or my child's life, either. You have the right to say ""This person causes me harm"" / ""This person is toxic in my life"", and choose not to interact with them, and any attempt to undermine this is basic manipulative gaslightling. It's mildly abusive, and not okay. Your boundaries with your family are not strictly speaking her business, if they are no longer part of your life."
dhj02y,"NTA, you want to talk big like a man expect it back"
dhj2gd,"I'm gonna say YTA, but hear me out. You are of course not the asshole for having this sensitivity or communicating / enforcing this rule. 

HOWEVER. People are sensitive about sex and their bodies, even men, and the way you wrote this post is pretty... insensitive. I get that your nose is hypersensitive and I'll buy that, but that isn't common, and so what your boyfriend is going to be *experiencing* whether you intend it or not is your constant disgust with his odor / genitals, especially in instances where he showered only hours prior. That's going to make him feel hurt and likely defensive, especially if you speak to him about this as abrasively as you write about it in this post.  

If you care about your partner and your relationship, you'd do well to exercise sensitivity about this subject with him, and try to find ways to make it (1) clear that this is your thing and not about him, and (2) make it sexy - remind him to shower so you can go crazy on him after, or join him in the shower once in a while. 


To be clear - he has no right to be pushy about sex and try to get you to do things you don't want - but you should also take care not to say things like ""tough luck"" and ""I want to wretch"" in reference to this issue if you want to have a healthy & loving sex life with this man."
dhj38r,"I’m leaning towards YTA. Even though your dad bought the cat for your family, you forfeited your rights when you didn’t care what happened to your cat FOR YEARS. During this time, your cat was taken care of by another family who seems to care about it much more than you do. 

Also, if you truly worried about your cat, you wouldn’t have let it outdoors laissez-faire like that. Indoor cats are from disease and accidents and can live a fulfilling life with the right care and entertainment."
dhj47i,"NAH but it's not really a big deal to throw in your well wishes even though they're repetitive. If you feel like saying ""happy birthday"" is too chorus-y, switch it up. Ask them if they've had a good birthday, if they're doing anything to celebrate."
dhj6ux,"NAH. He’s a little kid who was trying to be friendly, but didn’t know better. You could have used a nicer tone, but he needs to learn that’s inappropriate, so no big deal. Just try to be nicer if a similar situation every arises. Remember they don’t know bette rand they’re just trying to be friendly. They should absolutely be corrected, but preferably in a nice tone. I don’t blame you for accidentally snapping though because nobody wants someone grabbing their belt and it can be a very instinctual reaction."
dhj7ue,"NTA. If everyone is aware of your birthday, than it's not your fault you don't want to spend the day of YOUR BIRTHDAY with them. Your partner knew your plans, he's the asshole."
dhj9c3,"So you'll continue justifying driving against the flow of traffic, which you know could cause an accident, however unlikely it might be, because it's more convenient? 

YTA. Please stop before you seriously injure someone."
dhjalp,"NTA, she was way worse in that situation, getting very personal. You made a throwaway comment that happens online all the time."
dhjayw,"NTA. At 2, Ava won't enjoy having to sit still and be quiet (if her mom bothers to tell her so), and she's too young to remember it when she grows up anyway."
dhjbhd,"YTA but only a little bit - all the way through I was wondering if you'd even bothered to ask if she could come  - seeing that you didn't and vaguely know you should have is what landed me at my judgement. 

If you hadn't done the international thing I'd agree it's unreasonable for her to want to go on every trip with you, but that's clearly a huge hurdle in your relationship that you're both still recovering from - during this recovery period you do have to make a visible concerted effort to make her feel wanted and included. 

She was specifically excited about accompanying you to out of state tournaments, it's not like you can say she wouldn't have been interested

I kind of sympathise with her too - I had a similar but different thing happen and while I'm ""over"" it it still takes effort not to blow up when they talk about the trip

Also, this is totally unsolicited advice, but this far into a relationship, where travel is an important emotional topic, you might do well to start checking in with her before you say yes to things. It might lead to less friction - instead of just saying yes to your friends then telling your significant other ""I'm going on a trip next weekend"" it would be far more considerate to tell your friends you need to check your schedule, finding out if there's a way to bring your girlfriend along unobtrusively, then go to your gf and say ""some tournament friends have invited me along to a tournament to cut costs, but there's only one spot - do we have any plans I'm forgetting about next weekend because I'd really like to go"" might get you wayyyy farther"
dhjhaj,"NTA. However if this is someone you still want to be friends with you need to be really careful in passing across this message. I’d say have the conversation one more time with her letting her know, that if this pattern continues you would need to have your space back explaining the situation with work and all."
dhjiq3,"NTA but it's kind of besides the point. There are clearly systemic staffing / management issues there that you sticking around to serve wouldn't have helped, especially while injured and recovering. 

If your GM / corporate don't understand that there's a larger issue and instead want to pin it all on you not working your 25th hour in 48, then this isn't a place you want to be working anyway."
dhjlnv,"Yes YTA, holy hell.

Your stepson is suffering from an embarrassing problem and is twice as frustrated as you that he can't control his incontinence. Instead of being helpful and understanding, you're upset that he's upset about something he can't control. 

And make no mistake-- him saying that he's ""been doing it on purpose"" is a way for him to regain some semblance of control over his bladder. Instead of seeing it for the cry for help it is, you're ""fed up."" 

And you want to buy him pampers instead of toys to humiliate and punish him. That's a *child.* And you're a huge asshole."
dhjmal,"ESH. Him for just being a jerk, you for reinforcing stereotypes that literally get dogs killed."
dhjmi4,NTA. You agreed to stay on for a time to help them out as a show of good faith. They're punishing your good deed.
dhjpuv,"ESH. You knew she didn’t want other people to see the picture and you sent it anyway. Even if you didn’t think it’s a big deal, she is self conscious of it. Also, F2 probably felt bad about accidentally sending it out, which is why she may be siding with F1. F1, in my opinion, is blowing this way out of proportion, but maybe she has a really good reason for hating that picture we don’t know about. 

I would apologize again and say you didn’t know how much it would bother her and if you had known you wouldn’t have sent it. And that you value your friendship and would like to move forward. If she is still upset after all that time and a second apology, I’m not sure what to do."
dhjqbb,"Your partner cares more about competing with their siblings than taking a comfortable, financially sound next step with their partner. I hope you think twice about marrying this person."
dhjs9o,"NTA, not your fault he choose to go no vacation not pay down his debt and let it grow"
dhjsok,"NTA if he'd booked it just for himself and cancelled with less than 24 hours notice there are barely any hotels that would have given him a refund, why should you pay extra because he cancelled?"
dhjtdl,"NTA. Look, you are *definitely* overreacting. A cooked turkey heart is gross, but not cry-in-the-bathroom traumatizing. Your grandmother should have apologized as it was a mean thing to do in light of your sensitivity to gross things, but it was a *joke.* Next time, just verbalize your feelings instead of resorting to giving your grandma the cold shoulder."
dhjuxz,"NTA; at first neighbors were right to not let you in seeing as they didn't know who you were. After that they became very petty and imo, bitchy. For your sake I hope they lock themselves out of their flat one day."
dhk2ex,NTA - Having autism doesn’t mean you can be a shitty person
dhk2vh,"NTA. 

It's called Monopoly, not Corporation. It's literally meant for 1 single person to win, not two or a group. It's one thing when it was just between the both of them, but when it starts affecting other people's ability to win the game, it's too far."

dhkb4p,"Definitely YTA, and I think you know it based on your attempt to justify why you took the money in this post.

EDIT: your double TA now that we know that this guy giving you money has a crush on you."
dhkcj3,"You’d be the ass if you weren’t annoyed by this guy.  There’s one in every cohort. Talk to the instructor about it. It’s not really your place to pull him up unless the instructor has given him the hard word. If he still keeps it up, you mind have to band together with other students to shut him down.

dhkf8p,"NTA. She seems insecure about your relationship, probably why she's being controlling. That ain't ok. Also what's the point of keeping streaks just to keep streaks?"
dhkg7b,"YTA

Your fiancee doesn't want to spend the night with you before marriage.

dhkoj5,"NAH as long as you’re supportive and don’t make him feel bad about transitioning.  Basically you’ve just found out that the person you knew for a long time doesn’t really exist and that someone else was under all that, which can be difficult to wrap your head around.  It’s nobody’s fault but it’s understandable that you’d be upset"
dhkpru,"YTA - Saying it to his face, not over a post on social media, would have been a lot better."
dhksqf,"NTA if you confronted her. It could be best to do some kind of intervention though, since you say she's a hot-headed person."
dhkv4t,"ESH, she was being irresponsible, and you took it a bit too far on the language. I understand that you are scarred from the death of your friend, I really understand that, but you also have to understand that you have to control and respect. You could’ve scolded her and told her your concern, but ask yourself this, was the insulting and profanity really necessary?"
dhl2mw,"NTA.  You are not responsible for supporting your mom.  Because your mom is being unhealthy about it, and I am a mom of kids about your age, I’ll say what she should be saying: Go out and start your life with Kat and don’t worry about home because that’s not your job.  Don’t spend more than you earn, try to build up a decent savings, and be sure to take care of your health even though it seems like you’ll live forever now.  Don’t be a dick and make good choices.  Try to leave a positive mark on the things you do and the people you encounter.  Never ever make a decision based on fear or guilt.  Best of luck to you!"

dhl6ox,"NAH you can ask but she is within her rights to say no. Fragrance sensitivity is a thing, and in-between now and the wait for testing (assuming it's like my situation and you're looking at a 3 month wait, lol) you can be doing more in the mean time to manage the situation. 

1. Take a non-drowsy anti allergen in the morning. Every morning. I also have a daily nasal spray.
2. Get a cortisone cream to alleviate the itching symptoms.

dhld36,"NTA. From the sound of it, they called you just try and get a ride, not to actually see you. If the first thing they said was they needed a ride, they should accept your price. If the Ubers were, in fact, $100 then $45 is still better than taking an Uber. Seeing as they hung up after your response I feel like they were lowballing you and just wanted a cheap ride. Bad friends are the ones who try and take advantage of a friend, they're the ones that need to reevaluate their values.

Your father had well founded fears about you being on social media at a young age. It's not that he doesn't trust you it's that he cannot trust others and being young you are vulnerable prey. No way is this an insult, just a reality.

dhr3fv,"ESH.... But could also be ""not the asshole."" 

The kid sounds like he needs to get his shit together. He's a ""beer and pretzels"" gamer at a serious table. I think you need to contact your DM and explain everything calmly, and request that the DM communicates to the other player that he needs to ""buckle down."" 

Still, it wasn't cool of you to lose it on him in the middle of the gaming session. You were right to say no, as it is your character's property. But you should have waited to go OOC until after everything was said and done.

You might even just contact him directly and explain everything to him while you're calm.

I understand how frustrating shitty players are. Good luck."
dhr4ut,YTA. Not because you didn’t pay for their stuff. But because you cut in line (even if someone else offered) and then bought all the bagels that were left. This means people who were there before you and waited in line now won’t get any bagels. That’s really inconsiderate of you.

Ignore the text or say you are not their limo driver. Be firm and they will eventually stop asking. However.

dhsfiu,"YTA. You sound like one of those people who describe themselves as ""brutally honest"" which in reality just means they are an asshole to people.

There's a nice way to communicate this, and a mean way to communicate it. A nice way could be something like ""I'm not comfortable calling you dad and I don't think I will ever be, but I'm very happy to have you in our lives.""

A mean or cold way could be ""I'm never going to call you dad. You don't replace my dad. I won't ever consider you my dad because you aren't my blood.""

I doubt either of them ever expected you to call him dad but you didn't have to be such a dick about it."
dhsirv,"YTA- you didn’t even warn your husband you’d thrown out the margarine, you didn’t have to throw out the two tubs you already have, just finish them and move to a different brand. You went a bit psycho for no reason and I don’t think you’re in the right."

Based on that, I’m inclined to believe it wasn’t a bad storm, and you’re just whining because of some rain. Also, if you can’t drive a bike in rain, why do you have it?

At age 11 kids should definitely know that stealing and breaking things that don't belong to you is wrong.  At 5, maybe a bit less, but still that's a terrible excuse.

You know you're being manipulative.  And having worked in construction myself, if he tells his boss he's too tired to work and it might be dangerous for him and others, most bosses will send him home and not pay him.  He's right that it will set a bad precedent for him and his reputation.  People don't want to hire workers they can't rely on, and it's on him to make sure he's fit for work everyday.  Telling his boss he's too tired to work doesn't mean he gets sent to a desk job for the day, it means he gets sent home and maybe fired.  You're trying to fix the wrong problem here.  It's his sleeping habits he needs to change, not telling his boss he's tired."

On a side note, you should ask yourself if this dude is worth being in a relationship with. Some people are late a lot, some people smoke weed a lot, not really big things on their own. But he just sounds like he has a huge lack of motivation and is unwilling to change (and upset by you helping)"
dhtg7s,"This might be booed and downvoted a lot but to be completely honest, I dont give a rat's furry little derriere.

You have a NTA here. I used to be obese all through highschool, basically entered and exited puberty well above any form of ideal weight. To clarify I was never near the morbid line, but was still large enough to cause lasting damage to my skin and most importantly to my joints, I was basically raised to believe that I should eat as much and as often as I wanted and that would be fine.

As much as being candidly called fat by my father at that point would have hurt, being allowed to destroy my health was much, MUCH worse. I had to really develop health issues to get a hang of myself at the age of 21. I'm a pretty fit guy at the moment but that kind of fat does lasting damage and people who glorify it are much worse for society and the individual, compared to those trying to ""shame"" you into shape.

Keep on through with your efforts to help your daughter, if you truly believe she might be going through emotional issues go-ahead talk to her, if it's not straight forward enough for you to handle it on your own, suggest therapy, it will show when she's older and she will be very grateful, I wish you the best of luck with your endeavour, wish I had someone like you when it mattered."

dhv0ag,"I've worked in animal behavior for over 2 decades. 

I can tell you that as hard as it is for you to see your dog put down, it's harder for your dog.  Dogs ALWAYS look around the room trying to find ""their person,"" so I always try to encourage owners to be there in their pet's last moments. 

We can't hide from sad things. This very sad moment is part of what you signed up for when you welcomed a pet into your life. I know it is heartbreakingly sad. There are few things in life sadder. But almost everyone I've ever spoken to about it (and I've done studies on this) has said ultimately they were happy they could be there in that moment for their pet, and also for the other family members who were there. It is better to be sad you did something, than to be sad to missed something.

I can't make an official ""asshole"" judgment either way... nobody is an asshole in this situation. I do hope you'll attend, and your mom, your other sibling, and your dog will all appreciate it from their hearts.

I'm so, so, sorry you're going through this. 💗"

dhv11i,"NTA

It's a conflict for you. Honestly this is smart on your part as it would add an extra layer of contention in your relationship."
dhv20u,"NTA. Your mom seems to view her [estranged] family as *hers*, and is angry that you're building relationships with them independently of her. She probably is losing her sense of control over the situation as a result. Clearly she didn't care about seeing you regularly or *ever* seeing her niece until the two of you were creating a relationship not defined by *her*. (I'm guessing this behavior is not out of character for your mom, and she's generally someone who wants to call all the shots in her relationships?) The parting shot of ""I'm used to my family disappointing me"" is the wording of someone who is used to behaving manipulatively, though it's almost laughably transparent in terms of an attempt at manipulation.

All that to say, your mom sounds like she has a highly dysfunctional outlook on family relationships, and you should probably keep her on an information diet regarding future get-togethers with your cousin and aunt. Given that your mom is estranged from that branch of the family, it's not like she's likely to hear about them from other channels anyway, so this is probably the best way to keep the peace.

Edited to add: I agree with other comments here that your mom sounds like she may have narcissistic tendencies. It might be worth looking up personally checklists and seeing if the described traits track. Of course, you can't diagnose someone yourself on the internet, but after I figured out a particular relative of mine was (likely) a narcissist, it made it *so* much easier to understand their behavior and deal with them."
dhv4f1,NTA. the situation is dangerous for your health.

When you're house-sitting it is always the responsible thing to do to ask for permission before bringing over guests.  And no, just because he didn't specifically say ""No"" doesn't mean it's ok.  That's some immature thinking on your part and something manipulative people pull. That's on you.  So not only did you invite someone over without asking first, you also got naked in his jacuzzi with your BF.  So of course he's going to drain it and be pissed.  You already broke his trust by bringing over a guest without asking, so why should he trust you when you say you didn't fuck in his jacuzzi?"

Particularly as you don't believe in the whole godparent thing.  I'd tell them both there will be no godparents period."
dhxt1r,I'd phrase it to your parents like you want to instill responsibility into your brother. You could clean the room if they'd like but you really feel your brother will learn more about personal responsibility if he has to clean up his personal messes. Framing it like you want to help your brother grow as a person instead of wanting to avoid chores.
dhxxo0,"I’m going to go with ESH.  Based on what I just read it seems like you both have some communication issues and lack of coping skills. While I can completely empathize with your situation as I’ve been in similar ones, I think you also need to learn how to not force your expectations on other people. He obviously needs to learn how to communicate with you about what he needs in those times as well."
dhy0k1,"NTA.  Why would your friend assume you should miss work and take care of his dog when you don't even like dogs?  You had no control over the bus not taking his dog, so that wasn't your problem to solve, either.  Your friend needs to grow up and take responsibility for his own dog."
dhy19k,"YTA. 

You are being insecure. She will not be “groped” - it’s ACTING. 

Everything on stage is made to look real, when it is in fact not."
dhy1t4,"NTA Why on earth he'd burn a migraine trigger is beyond me. He has to take more care and ensure he only uses the right stuff.

 I have specific food triggers and my husband wouldn't dream of using them in cooking, which is pretty analogous to your situation.

Hope the migraine gets better soon"
dhy6kb,"NTA, you have all the rights to be angry. She walked out and then expects you to just let her back into your life as if she did nothing wrong? That's fucked."
dhy7zq,NTA.  This keeps you alive.
dhya63,YTA you have care right? She doesn't leave you hanging? Get over it?
dhydpc,"By doing that am I not sending the message that it’s okay for her to be disrespectful towards me? I was willing to talk to her when she called for N’s bday, she hung up on me."
dhyjc5,"NTA 

You know what you want for a good reason, that’s all there is to say."
dhyjqu,"YTA

I notice you left your age out... lol

But yes, getting mad at not getting free thing always makes you TA.

There are any number of reasons why they might not want you to have a phone, they are valid to them.

Did you get a job?  Offer to chip in?  Or just ""why no gimme thing??"""
dhynd8,"NTA she's 23 she's got to get it together sometime.

Diapers in the floor? 1 diaperleft in the floor 10 minutes after changing is too much for me. I can handle sloppiness pretty well but not that."
dhyqbl,"ESH-kinda

They suck for choosing such a stupid hill to potentially literally die on

You suck for trying to police your friends amd being insistent after their refusal, even with the best of intentions.

You can lead a horse to water, but you cant make it drink"
dhyqh7,"NTA. I understand the resentment for your father all too well. Your wedding is your day, remember that. Do whatever you know is going to make YOU happiest on that day. Good luck:)"
dhys27,"your age is glaring. yta. your brother is 3yrs old! he’s a toddler! of course he’s a brat lol. newsflash: you are also a brat! stop hurting your baby brother ffs. he shouldn’t be doing chores because he’s a fucking toddler! you should be doing those chores. also? i know you’re 13 and still a child but like... nobody believes that “i changed this summer!” 

good heavens i feel for your poor mother in my soul."
dhytba,"It's (at least) the second day in a row you were going to have sex and you stop in the middle to complain she's not interested enough in you??

I'm too confused to even give a judgement."
dhyv5t,"YTA but only because it’s been 2 years. Next time, don’t wait until you’re leaving to report disgusting behavior and don’t accept in action from HR or management after reporting it. As far as his wife goes, she probably already knows."
dhyyov,"NTA. Call up your brother and agree on an exit plan. That way no one gets stuck holding the proverbial bag. Then you both need to go over there and lay it out for her:

- Neither of you will be taking care of her after x date. 

- She needs to work with the hospital/insurance/whoever to arrange weekly assistance. 

- She needs to spend her money wisely and treat people kindly because neither one of you will be back as her caregiver.

Call and visit her as you see fit and take care of yourself."
dhz0t5,"YTA, it wasn't an emergency. It wasn't life or death. Your mum was trying to make you feel better most likely."
dhz365,"YWBTA for taking someone else’s dog. That’s not your place at all. That’s just stealing someone’s dog.
 
NTA for telling mom. She needs to know he’s not in a safe space."
dhz4ah,"Lol, wat?

Your fabric analogy is spot on. NTA"
dhzdwz,"NTA for not telling your friend, her parents were the ones with valid information on her condition, location, etc and anything you told her would only make her stressed without calling her parents for more information anyways. However, YTA for not accepting your judgments and arguing with anyone who disagrees with you."
dhzr7l,"I would be more concerned as to why Sam is being allowed to run roughshod through the workplace unchecked, particularly in light of their racist comments. 

You might not have a formal HR department, but your higher-ups need to know.

NTA."
dhzrd1,"YTA, 100%. ""She's pretty because she doesn't have something you have and want more of."" Your girlfriend wanting piercings isn't going to mess her face up, they're temporary and most leave minimal scarring at most if she *decides* to take them out, but it's just that--her decision. Do you hate piercings more than you like having a girlfriend, because you're on your way to being single, or at least I hope so, for her sake."
dhzrth,"YTA, always consider the weight of your words, especially when you're taking about events as important as your wedding. You may have said it flippantly and not meant anything by it, but she heard that your anniversary meant nothing because it wasn't a big milestone."
dhztfm,"Yeah I was trying to remember that, because I don't want my son to be left out and go without. But I also don't want him to be like my neices who have said ""is that it?"" After opening all their presents. It's tough to find a middle ground."
dhzukl,NTA. it's not that hard to explain to kids. I did when my daughter was about the same age and saw a gay couple on TV. She was just stoked to find out she could marry her favourite teacher now lol
dhzumk,NTA and I’m with you. Not funny.
dhzw31,"YTA- 2 in 3 people have tattoos now , at least in the western world. Only ""nice guys"" see women with tattoos as anything other than just that."
dhzw3s,"NTA...not even sure why you’d think you were, totally ok and nothing wrong with your thought process here."
dhzxn6,"NTA, but if you want to be completely free and clear, just ask her if she wants it back. Chances are she probably doesn't--she can't return it at this point, she can't re-gift it with the note (unless she were to remove it, too), and it's just a reminder of you and the breakup."
dhzy5m,"NTA, you had no bad intentions. You didn’t see him, if he was waiting on that spot you probably should have moved but you didn’t know and he wasn’t consolable. he was grossly overreacting. He shouldn’t have been screaming and yelling at you repeatedly but the line “fucking asshole with your brain in your ass” is hilarious! You did the right thing it’s best not to get involved in those types of confrontations."
di00uq,"NTA simply for reporting inappropriate behavior in public to a security guard. 

But your detail about their disabilities/perceived disabilities makes me super uneasy. You are definitely an asshole if you reported them for any other reason than what I stated above. Ask yourself, would you have reporting two people without disabilities making out?"
di0309,Please try to write actual sentences instead of giant run on sentences that are a jumble of words. That said. ESH. You for being glad at a family members health issues. And him for forcing you to do things you really didn’t want to do. That’s what it boils down too. You both suck. Stand up for yourself and don’t play. Worst case he grounds you. Big deal.
di07w3,You’re not an asshole for denying him separate lines. YTA for how you handled it. You could have just said there’s one line and you were next. You don’t need to be rude right off the bat.
di0bc1,NTA. Your parents’ lack of financial planning isn’t your issue to solve.
di0bvn,"ESH. First, you don’t drop your child off without assuring they make it into the house and you at least see an adult. Second, you don’t make plans without clearing them with the person they’ll effect. Third, you really should’ve had your phone charged."
di0e96,"YTA. No one has to say a prayer if they don’t want to. And it’s not even your kid, so you overstepped. 

In my opinion, the correct “teaching moment” would have been to tell him that he doesn’t need to pray but please be courteous as the rest of the family does."
di0fft,YTA. Stop being a brat. She was probably ready to be done with the day.
di0jao,"NTA. Break up with this guy. He is keeping you secret for a reason, and it is not sustainable. 

Honestly, I'd go to his fam and introduce yourself as the GF. The fall out will tell you why you're a secret."
di0n2l,"NAH

A lot of people offer things and then regret those choices or get wrapped up in their own thing. It sucks, but it happens.

Just shoot her a text -

""You once offered to do my hair and makeup, which I'm super thankful for because you're amazing at it. Theres only 3 weeks to go, I still need a cut and dye, and we haven't gone over options and I'm kinda stressing out. 

If youd rather not do it, or dont have time, it's okay honestly, I just need to know so I can organize something else. If you can though, can we get together and talk things over? I'm free X, y, or Z. If those dont work let me know some options for you.

Thank you again!"""
di0p14," > i've never been the type to work hard in school

Honestly YTA.  It seems like you didn't even try.

Also sorry about your Dad."
di0tii,"NTA but at what point are you going to learn and close off access to your accounts and stop giving him money and pay your own bills? If you don't put your foot down when it first happens, you're basically saying it's okay."
di0yzw,"Your parents are dumb

NTA"
di0yzz,"NAH - You can ask him, but don’t expect to get a good response. I would go with the “conditions” rather than asking him to outright NOT smoke in the apartment. Explain why it’s bothering you and see if there’s a compromise that can be worked out. 

Regardless - it’s his apartment and he can do what he wants, but the same can be said for you. If you’re both paying an equal amount, it’s fair to want to set conditions, considering you have logical reasons behind it."
di0zog,"NAH, he's 16.  He probably doesn't even want to be at the party.  Let it go, this isn't a fight worth having."
di118v,NTA but last I checked people in the military get paid so I don't understand why you have to pay for everything.
di11ex,"NTA -- Is he that childish that he can't spend a couple of nights without you by his side, while he sleeps, knowing he has a contagious illness? Sounds like a selfish dude."
di121p,Nta if she can't take care of them she don't deserve them. Just imagine what the inside of her house looks like. Her health is an issue as well
di12a5,"NAH. I don't know you but I'm going to be direct. If everything you're saying is true, you might be depressed. He wants to help but doesn't know how. I'd advise professional help. It can get better but you may just need a little extra help to figure out how. Nothing wrong with that."
di136j,"YTA  People accidentally spell names wrong sometimes. Hell, my Grandma ordered my Grandpa's headstone with his name spelled wrong on it (this was 3 years after his death, so it isn't like she was in the throes of grief). 

People make mistakes. What is the big deal?"
di15tf,"This definitely seems like a validation post since no one would actually call you the asshole.

If you want advice, you need a different thread. Truthfully though, you should focus on protecting yourself. She's hurting you. Ask her to stop to protect yourself. Her taking her anger out on others or threatening to leave the family is not on you."
di16on,"NTA. I’m amazed she even tried to justify not paying you back. If you ask to borrow money, especially 2,000 dollars of if, you should be planning to pay it back that day."
di18jp,"NTA: Welcome to an issue that every person (mostly adults) juggle with all of the time. It is your resource and your choice on how you want to use it. There will be times you will choose to give, times you give when you really shouldn't, and times when you really don't have the resources to give. For me, the hardest decisions are the times when you decide to not give; especially if/when the resources are there.

I find it rather mature of you in already seeing a pattern with this person and understanding the balancing of resources you and others are having to juggle to continue in giving to this person. Especially in contrast to their efforts in providing for themselves.

What will differentiate between you coming across as an asshole or not will be how you move forward and their receptiveness to it. As a friend, be honest and straight forward, compassionate in your delivery too. Try to not make the other person feel bad and never use hurtful terms or expressions. Being in a position of need often is a vulnerable spot. You may have to choose to do different things, free things, if you want to continue doing things together.

Lastly you may find that this is not a friend you would like to continue to have due to what is important to you in a friendship.

None of this is easy.
Good luck and hopefully you have a situation where this friendship only gets stronger by being honest and thoughtful in how you move forward.

:-)"
di18us,"ESH. 

You’re NTA for not buying him a gift, and he’s TA for questioning you about it. But you’re definitely overestimating how generous you’re being for buying him a beer, and totally TA for asking him to pay you back.

I’ve sent you a Venmo bill for my time."
di19g4,"NTA. She uses the n-word openly in a public profile. It's not a matter of, what if her profile were private, because the fact of the matter is that you *don't* know what she keeps private, you only know what she puts out there, and what she puts out there is abhorrent.

Plus, even if that weren't all the case, she sounds like a brat. Not calling back after three calls, and then being irritable and demanding an explanation from you? Nonsense."
di1bxz,"NTA... But you should know that depending on what career you want, there might be a grain of  truth to what they said. Some professions/companies can be much more restrained in what’s okay in terms of tattoos, piercings and hair dyes than others."
di1f7p,"NTA

It sounds like you both agreed she would be home by 3 because you have to run to work for an hour. You can’t leave kids alone, so she has to get home. Her making it home by 4, you needing to spend an hour at work, and her having to be at work by 5 does not add up unless one of you is taking the kids with you. 

She can always see her friends next week. 

She honestly sounds more manipulative, trying to make you feel bad for expecting her to follow the agreed upon time."
di1f7w,"> I told the doc that I had a wedding I had to go to, but he told me don't go

You asked your doctor if you could go to the wedding and he said no. Did you tell the family member that and she still chewed you out?

NTA"
di1j11,"Your mom should have called first.

NTA"
di1m5l,You’re boyfriend is TA.  You didn’t know. I don’t like people touching my stuff without asking
di1pts,NTA.  Your parents didn’t try to take you to a different dentist at a young age to figure out the issue?  How awful.
di1rhh,"YWBTA.  Say nothing about them possibly over-paying. Whatever they paid, they were pleased to do it. If you say anything, it could be read as you're thinking the gift is cheap since you'd be pointing out how inexpensive it can be gotten for.  If they paid the lower price, you would be putting them on the spot. Keep the gift if you like it and my vote is to say nothing."
di208s,"NTA. We have the same issues, my wife has to be up at four to leave by five every morning for work. She sets her clothes out in the en suite bathroom before bed and changes and test ready in there while I sleep (I work from home and don’t have to be up until 8) 

Works great. She gets up, gets ready and is off to work and I never wake while she is. 

And likewise when she’s off and sleeps in, I change in the bathroom or out in the house to let her sleep. It’s all about compromise and doing that little bit extra for the one who doesn’t have to be up so early."
di20gz,"I think this is the wrong sub for this. This is a complex friendship and mental health situation  there are no assholes here, so NAH."
di229x,"NTA.
You clearly feel close enough to knife to consider them a friend, and from what i gathered from the setup, you arent supposed to know people very well in the groups. It seems like you were only following the rules. I suppose my only question is is there a punishment for being conflicted? If not, then you are 100% NTA"
di23yo,"Yeah, YTA. It’s not the oppression olympics. No one gets to be the winner."
di24pt,"This reeks of teenage insecurity... however NAH. You’re not an asshole for wanting to talk to friends. She clearly feels that their is a precedent for this request, as she consults you about the same thing. If I were you, I’d focus less on if you’re an asshole and more on finding out why she’s insecure."

di2bc6,"NAH yet, I don't think.  She doesn't have to feel comfortable, but maybe sometimes that means she has to wait.  If you're not in a rush, feel free to say ""sure"", if not, say ""sorry, I'm in a rush, you'll have to wait for the next one"".  

I don't think that her phobia automatically gives her priority over you, but this is something that a) won't come up that often, and b) isn't that big of a deal unless you decide to make it one out of principle.  In which case you'd kind of be an asshole."
di2c4h,"NAH - I've been drugged at a bar before and I have indeed gone to the bar after, however the friends I went with didn't know it had happened to me and I couldn't talk him out of the bar without telling him the story.

My real question is why do you want to go to this bar so bad? Is it made of gold? Are their drinks so strong you see god? Are you curious what kind of bar people get drugged at? 

Just think on that, and then make sure K doesn't find out, no matter what. It's been a year but if they didn't catch who did it it's not long enough for the wound to heal."
di2gwq,"YTA he's clearly self-conscious about his posture. Let it go. Talk to him about it in private maybe, or just let him live his life. 

I'm self-conscious about my posture (which isn't even that bad, though it used to be) and when anyone tells me to stand up straight, it makes me want to slouch more to hide. 

Also, you suck for being so concerned about being taller than him. If you like him, like him for him, not his height."
di2jvr,"NTA, He shouldn’t be lying to you or going behind your back. 

However don’t forget the old saying, there’s 2 kids of people in this world: people who watch porn, and liars."
di2prv,"NTA at the end of the day she may just drive anyway but you can’t stop someone from doing what they are gonna do. But it sounds like she shouldn’t have a license and it’s not you making that call, it is a professional. She needs to accept her limitations and she has options but she is gonna do what she is gonna do."
di2rep,"YTA

you wouldn't be going for Steve, you're going for your sister. He won't be hurt if you don't go, she will. If the two of you have a decent relationship, don't throw it away over this."
di2uj0,"NTA. If you want to partake in drugs, cool, but you can’t expect to be able to do it in or at someone else’s home."
di2wua,"NTA? Honestly you’ve saved up the money for this trip and made the plans. It sucks that you can’t be around for your brother’s homecoming, but as long as you let him know not to expect you and that you can call, I see no issues."
di2x1r,I'm going to go with NTA on this one. It was a holiday. You should be celebrating with your loved ones. Plus he should have asked you how you felt since you guys were celebrating the holiday together. He ended your plans without asking and left.
di2xxx,"NTA. Dropping in uninvited is rude in most cases, especially if she expects you to feed and house her and her son. You’re justified."
di32fa,"NTA!  She is being manipulative big time.  What if she got cancer...well what if YOU got cancer, what if I got cancer, it could happen to any of us, but after the age of 8 the ""what if"" game gets ridiculous.  She seriously sounds like a tween here!  

This is not the time for that talk, and it's not going to even be resolved in one talk.  You two should go to a family counselor and have that 3rd person to help lead the discussion and hopefully get things accomplished.

The loss of anyone you love is devastating, including animals.  I have lost several humans that I was extremely close with, who I loved dearly  (including my younger sister and also my best friend of 22 years) and had unbearable pain, but the loss of my dog was JUST as painful, if not more.  It hurts and you need time to mourn your loss.  Dont ever let anyone tell you that losing a beloved pet is less important than other losses."
di33n2,"ESH, you’re both acting like children."
di351z,NTA. It’s your life to live. They are being overbearing.

di3sse,"ESH, though i suspect you know this.

You admit your actions could have caused an accident. Sometimes, you just gotta lets the assholes go. Takes less time and effort vs having to manage traffic while cutting off someone, at least IMO."
di40s8,Very very very obvious NTA. Forget all about J just never ever talk or think about J again. He gone. Yeetus deletus him from your memory and never look back
di42aw,YTA. How can you ask for her opinion and then yell at her for giving one? She didn’t even seem to be harsh based of what you said she said. You can’t force somebody to like something by “ trying harder”. If I was her I’d want nothing to do with the book either after that.
di43gl,"NAH I think you should have told him to ask the people behind instead of just saying ""no"" tbh"
di43mz,"NAH. 

Scheduling conflicts happen, it's a reality of life. 

Whoever's you choose not to attend be sure to send them your apologies that you can't attend, a congratulations card (with money if it seems appropriate, but not required.), and maintain interest in things like wedding photos. 

If it's your sister's wedding that yiu choose to not attend, do keep in mind that it may look super bad to outsiders and there may be drama. Like, she already sounds a drama person but now you're backing out of being a bridesmaid *and* not attending her wedding in favour of attending a friend's? It sounds like you don't get on with her side anyway but this may make things much worse. 

Again, totally up to you NAH no matter which one you choose but you choice should be with proper consideration to the possible social consequences no matter how bullshit those may be."
di47x0,"You’re NTA. Not even a little. One thing I learned real quick while treating my mental health is that family accounts for like 80% of people’s mental health problems. They put a lot of unnecessary stress on us, and in fact are the ones who are selfish. It actually sounds like you did the smartest thing for you and your mental health. I hope you and your dude have a great holiday."

di4l1l,"YTA.

>Maybe it's because I(30yr M) grew up before flu shots were a thing

Just no. Flu vaccines have been around for more than 50 years. I'm a little bit older than you and have got one every year that I can remember.

And the vaccine is just as much for everyone else as it is for you.

Get the fucking shot."
di4nvr,ESH - I'm as surprised as you that she found this hurtful but I don't know why you started shouting at her either
di4tmh,"NAH. 

You wouldn't be an asshole, but please, please take my word for it (as a total stranger on the internet) that you should go to your friend's birthday. 

Colleges have parties literally every weekend. You will have so many more opportunities to go to college parties. 

Your friend sounds like she's having a tough time. I would be. And you're her best friend. She'd appreciate it if you came. 

Five years from now, looking back at this, do you think you'll regret not having gone to this particular block party? Of course not. Do you think you'll regret skipping your friend's birthday? If you think that's even reasonably likely, you should go."
di4wgi,"NTA. Maybe you should have spoken up and said, ""Hey, this isn't very fun if we don't actually have to try."" He shouldn't have called you stupid or childish, though. Who wants to drive 2.5 hours to have your boyfriend peek over the mazes? Takes all the challenge out of it. I'd be disappointed, too. But the real issue is you told him you felt a way, and he sorta invalidated it."
di520j,NTA but why go at all? Stay home and make an even bigger point.
di52vx,NTA - did he invite his friends to dinner at your place without even consulting you? He can't be offering people your car and food. That's not how it works.
di57tk,NTA for reporting him. I don’t see what Molly having a husband and kids has to do with anything though.
di5d0m,"Yeah, you cancelled therapy that you need, i'm sure that will teach them!

You're only hurting yourself, who cares about them or what they said? Get back in therapy if you need it."
di5dfj,NTA. they should’ve carried their own weight just like you were trying to. group projects suuuuck so I dont blame you for choosing to do it yourself
di5pac,"NTA She sounds very needy and that can be very draining.  And she’s being very dramatic saying she could have been in the hospital - sure you would have heard - her family would have told you!

di5y1u,"Eh this is tough. I’m asian but adopted but I have asian friends who grew up in this type of household. It’s tough. 

I’m gonna say that ESH. And I don’t mean that in like a “you’re terrible way.” You’re teenagers and this is a mistake that I can see a teenager making out of anger and frustration. I know talking to her rationally won’t make any difference to how she thinks but being passive aggressive is definitely not the right tactic either from the results you got. 

But your mom is being unreasonable even by some asian parent standards. It’s just cruel for her to kill your brothers self-esteem in this misguided effort to get him to do better. Chances are if you hasn’t intervened he would have alienated himself from her anyway. 

I think you and your brothers best tactic is for you both to sit down with her and tell her this kind of shaming won’t change behavior. Let her disagree and yell if she wants. And the next time she berates him or you, just nod and say “mm-hmm” and basically don’t give her anything to use as ammo.

di638s,"“I sometimes can be overly harsh by saying what I think about people before assessing if it’s worth saying.”

Is that an oblique way of saying you can be a bit cruel sometimes?

ESH.  

Your friend sucks because he attacked you first.  He probably knows you don’t like him.  If he had a problem with your behaviour he should have confronted you in private.  He was a dick about how he handled it.

Usually I believe you shouldn’t dish it out unless you can take it, but you crossed a line.  If you had said something about his annoying personality then that would be fair game.  He can’t help having a lazy eye, it’s totally out of his control.  There's nothing aesthetically wrong with having a lazy eye.  A lazy eye just looks unusual, unusual isn’t bad.  Thanks to people like you he probably has self-esteem issues about his eyes and you touched a nerve.

I would say your friend started it, but I don’t know whether you’ve been sending him passive aggressive signals that you don’t like him.  You were both assholes, but by crossing a line you almost absolved your friend of his assholery and claimed the crown."

You act like “the hard talk” is something every mom has with their daughter; it’s not. That was heartbreaking to read.

Your income is the household's income. Expenses are the household's expenses. This is why you're in a situation where your husband thinks that when he starts earning more money, you two don't need to sit down together to decide what to do with it. Financial disagreements are the #1 cause for divorce, so if you cannot get on the same page with a communal budget, communal expenditure/savings goals, and an agreement about yours work/life balance, you're headed for the cliffs."
di7puy,"NTA. It sounds like your sister isn’t so much asking if her fiancé can stay with your family so much as demanding it. This is especially concerning since it seems like your family has not even met this guy virtually. If she had provided a proper introduction and asked you to accommodate someone she is close to, I might be more inclined to see her side of things — though even so, things get tricky when the entire relationship is online.

Not even close.  If you went away for a long 4-day weekend and left your husband in control of everything that goes on in your household, could he handle it?

It will affect your health in ways I'm sure you've done research on, and will require you to make a number of changes in your habits and lifestyle which may very well affect your partner. If your partner is not okay with these changes and isn't comfortable with being with someone who is a surrogate, that's totally up to them. If you choose to go forward with this plan, then you should prepare for the consequences that your partner may not want to continue your relationship. 

Every relationship is allowed to have a deal breaker, and if this is it for your partner, then you may have to give up this dream for the time being or altogether. There are plenty of other ways you can go about benefiting other people that don't necessarily have as much of an impact on every aspect of your life - look into volunteering opportunities, donate blood, etc."

Edit for afterthought: in some cultures, it's customary for the paying party to refuse compensation, and for the compensating party to insist. After a bit of push and pull, whoever decides to give up first resolves the end of the paying conflict. Not sure if this applies here, but after asking enough times you can probably rest the ""debt"" safely with a clean conscience. Then again, if like a year later these people ask you for the money on the next vacation, that would be a true AH move on their part."

didyzs,Why not just say you miss hanging out - just the two of you and see what he says. You don’t need to bring up his girlfriend. He’ll likely just get defensive and you’ll really ruin it then.

And this is coming from a male who doesn’t know how to do this delicate stuff either. The way my wife and I do it is by splitting the duties: she washes and dries the clothes, I fold and put in bedrooms.

It’s all about specialisation."
dieg1a,"NAH. She can't help having a real phobia, and you shouldn't miss your friends wedding because of it. 

And seriously, she felt *vulnerable* after? This sounds attention seeking to me. She's an adult and she's back down on earth. She doesn't need a babysitter."
diej5s,"NTA

You really need to go to r/relationships for some advice. This is not a relationship advice sub.

But, for what it's worth, she is not a great friend if she feels lying about flunking a key class is a harmless prank. Then, when you push back, she calls you too sensitive. But, when you question the friendship compatibility issue, she starts crying and saying you've never treated her like a best friend. 

Is being a best friend involve lying to make a joke and calling you too sensitive because you didn't find it funny?"
diekui,"NAH (besides the toxic BF of course)
I was in your friend's place once. I know my friends were close to ditching me after two years of this shitty relationship. (He practically made me cut contact with them). I remember I would even get angry at my friend when she'd tell me to leave him, because ""she didn't understand"". Bullshit, I was in so deep I didn't see reason.
But they stayed, and helped me through it and I can't imagine my life without them. I'd probably still be in that toxic relationship.
On the other hand you do have the right to put yourself first, because it's your life not anyone else's, and you deserve to be happy, too... Depends how much you care for your friend I guess, and if those situations really make you miserable. It's really not a black and white kinda situation."
dielnd,"India's huge. They have hundreds of individual ethnicities, languages, and regional cuisines. Butter chicken might be popular outside of India, but there are far more dishes that locals would be familiar with. And that's assuming your friend of Indian background even grew up with Indian food in their youth. 

It'd be like asking someone from California, who's never been to Philadelphia (and never seen or tasted one) to explain a Philly cheese steak. They \*might\* be able to make a guess based on the mentioned components, but that doesn't begin to describe the process or the taste. 

So while it might not be outright and overtly racist, it's insensitive and rather naive to expect your friend to immediately know just because they are Indian. At the very least, it can be annoying to be the token (insert ethnicity here) to answer any and all questions about said ethnicity."

If you don’t want to hang out with Joe, you don’t have to. You can cite whatever reason you want to, or none at all; you’re not obligated to spend time with anyone.

However, let’s be realistic here: 4 months doing mostly nothing may seem like a long time, but when you just graduated highschool, it’s not. This will go on as long as his parents let it, which I suspect will not be much longer unless they’re fairly well off.

It’s his choice to do what he wants with his life. Maybe he doesn’t know what he wants to do yet. Maybe he’s depressed and doesn’t want to do anything at all. Maybe he needs to stop smoking weed. There’s a lot to speculate here. When reality sets in, it will hopefully change his mind. 

If you end the friendship now, don’t expect to be accepted back when he gets his shit together; doing nothing for 4 months and having your friends abandon you as a consequence does not showcase a great depth to the friendship.

I think he should do something with his life too, but it’s not your responsibility to make him think that. The responsibility is on the people he’s leeching off (his parents, I assume)."

dig7bj,"ESH. You need to learn to cook. It’s an essential life skill and it’s kinda a huge turnoff to have a partner that can’t even cook 1 dish. Seriously, make it your goal to learn to cook ONE dish. It can be something easy. Search the internet for “easy 30 minute meals” - while it won’t take you 30 minutes the first time, I think it’s inexcusable that you won’t even attempt to do something like that.   

Second, he sucks for how he is handling this, and how he is not helping in upkeeping the house at ALL. 

You guys need a serious conversation about chore splitting"
dig9dq,"YTA - Look at it from his point of view, you've just cut contact with no explanation whatsoever.

You couldn't have known and it's not really fair to make you do it again when it's your turn to sleep (especially since you already said you'd do it the next day) but wife is obviously struggling with juggling home responsibilities and baby. 

Just try to give her a hug when she's less cranky and tell her you'll take care of the household stuff  on your day off. Make a list of chores that fall to BOTH OF YOU and try to get as much of it done as possible. She'll appreciate the extra effort."

digfx7,"NTA, if she agreed to help you then she should of told her date she had something she had to do. She obviously doesn’t understand the seriousness of this video.

digh9f,"NTA, This kid sounds like a lazy spoiled brat. It would be good if he was to be disciplined. School can be hard yes. But I think you need to try your hardest. I never set a good example when I was in highschool. But if I could go back I would.  As the older sibling to my two sisters I constantly check up on the youngest to see if she is getting it done.

digrm1,"NAH. I hate these threads, it always comes down to the same thing. You are free to do as you like with your body. Your body, your choice. However there may be consequences to those choices. He is free to feel a certain way about your actions, and he's free to tell you about those feelings. There may be consequences to him opening those feelings and making those statements to you. If you guys can't communicate as a couple and get through this, or if one of you feels that this is worthy of relationship termination, that's how it's going to be. Neither of you can force the other one to remain in the relationship, and neither one of you can force the other to totally acquiesce to their requirements. 

These posts and situations suck because you're finding out where each other's Overton Window of a Relationship is, by stepping outside of it. You're fine with your breasts being exposed in this situation and context, he isn't. Some guys would be totally fine with this, other guys might not be okay with it. It's different for everyone. If he took his pants off to get in the hot tub and his penis was exposed, you might not be okay with that, but it's his body and his choice. You both have to ask yourselves ""has this situation proven that we are incompatible with each other?"""
digusa,"NAH.

I'm going to assume you are a dude, because I have a feeling this may have partially happened due to this factor...

You guys are in highschool. As someone less than four years separated from that part of my life, I'm going to say that most people in highschool are kinda shitheads. 

This is where gender (if you are a dude) comes in. You are not the asshole because based off of what you said this was simply a conversation. If you are a guy, chances are, your sex life is probably celebrated, or at least tolerated. A chick? Not so much. Even now, certain societal expectations will probably shame her for any sexual act, especially in highschool, because whether we want to admit it or not, that barrier is still very much in place.

Check up on her when she's cooled off."
diguvr,"NTA and of she’s up next for Christmas wouldn’t you just switch? She hosts thanksgiving, you host Christmas."
dih087,"NTA. Call it what you see it. Cut her out. She seem toxic if she doesn’t realize what she doing or if she does, it isn’t right to do this."
dih1ar,"NTA I cringed harder and harder with each word you wrote. You pretty much described what I would consider a complete nightmare—kids who aren't yours, a dog who won't do his business with all the distractions, being the neighborhood babysitter... ugh!"
dih2fy,"YTA. Trust me, I’ve been in almost the exact same situation as you. I lied to my parents, and it broke their heart. I couldn’t forgive myself for a long time. Believe me, they would much rather accept a bad grade than find out that their child is so scared of telling them the truth. 

Here’s my advice: don’t make the mistake that I did. Call up your parents. “Hey, mom, dad, I have something to tell you. I didn’t do well in this exam, because I didn’t put in as much effort as I should have, and I’m really sorry, but I didn’t want to lie to you about the grade. Our professor has told us that our final grade will be counted though, so I’m going to work extra hard and make you proud.”

They might be a little upset with your grade, but that will pass. It’s nothing compared to the heartbreak they will face if they find out that you lied. Even if they don’t find out, just don’t do it, OP. Telling them the truth will build the trust between you and your parents. I rarely reply to AITA posts, but this struck hard because I made this mistake over 5 years ago and it still haunts me. 

Trust your parents, OP. They want the very best for you. Good luck."
dih6dm,"YTA for the timing of 2am 20days after you've been sleeping with it there.

She is an adult; she forgot the charger, so she can figure out on her own how to deal with that by borrowing one or buying a replacement at a nearby store, or even (horror of horrors) be without her phone for the day since she does have access to other methods of contacting people if necessary. If she is willing to divorce you over this, you'd be better off letting her."

Mostly because you wrote the letter very well and asked for gifts that are not outrageous expensive.  This is a very tricky line, it is usually tacky to ask for specific gifts, but you did it well.  The only thing i might change is the bullets for listing the gifts.  It might look more casual if you wrote out the ideas in a paragraph form.
""We would love experiences like museum trips or events around town, new and unusual coffees or imported beer, fun new ingredients, local ciders, or just a donation to our charity.""
But that is the only change i would make."
dii7ya,"Dude, there’s no way you’re an asshole for this. In fact, you weren’t an asshole ENOUGH. You’ve got a tough road ahead of you if you don’t start putting your foot down more with dudes like this. You’re probably young, so I get it - I used to be overly nice, too. But that’ll only hurt you way worse in the long run, trust me.

Edit to add: Also, I’m NOT blaming you for his behavior! He is 100% disgusting and needs to be told how gross he is for thinking being pushy like this will work. But you need to look out for yourself, do not hang out with boys who make you uncomfortable from the very moment you meet them. And TELL him how shitty he is for putting you in such an awkward position, who knows how many other girls he’ll act like this towards. Or, even worse - if his behavior escalates. 

Confrontation can be your friend. Use it wisely."
diib1d,NTA. That sounds like a lot for a fifteen yo. You should be allowed to enjoy your teenage years.
diid9d,"NAH - It depends how you handle it. You can politely decline and just say you would like to spend your birthday with your friends/just doing something you would like to do.  As long as you assure Grandma that you'll see her at Thanksgiving, I'm sure the family will understand. Make sure to wish Grandma a happy birthday and ask for pictures so she doesn't think you're just blowing her off."

diilyi,"YTA it’s her choice whether or not she wants to blacken her lungs. If it upsets you that much, maybe you should distance yourself from that person.

Destroying the cigarettes wasn’t something you had the authority to do."
diim3l,"ESH, what communication was there to have? You understood what his passive agressive group chat comment implied, certainly. Clearly you acknowledge none of you want to clean up after yourselves, yet you are taking offense at the fact somebody has had enough of it. Why should this person need to deal with the consequences caused by everyone elses irresponsibility? The fact it took a week and a half to realize your own dishes were missing, and not in any cabinets is evidence enough that changes need to be made on your end. This is not just your fault, your other roommates as well. 

You really can't blame the one person out of five being frustrated that they are negatively impacted by those who just don't care."
diimxz,"NTA Is there a private place you can discuss this with your manager? If you chose to take that route, be clear with examples and don't get worked up.

Frankly, there's just one of those in most workplaces."
diinwy,"NTA. I don't think his mental illness has anything to do with it honestly. Up until you mentioned the theft I was thinking ""you can't just call the cops on someone being weird and vaguely creepy"" but if he stole stuff it's an appropriate response.

I know this isn't an advice sub but personally I don't like to involve police unless absolutely necessary and I don't think I would do so over cheap jewelry. I think it comes down to whether you would involve the police for this level of theft if anyone else had done it. If your neighbor had taken the rings, what would you do?"
diip1a,YTA. Don’t make plans in front of people if you’re not planning to invite them. It’s just rude and puts you in bad situations.
diiuop,NTA - This wasn't a library and people can't expect the world to be quiet because a noise might trigger their PTSD. You asked him if everything was okay and he could've said something then but he didn't.

That all being said, you're in class, this isn't even like they are asking you to use your spare time to do this. Just engage and do the exercise. The people who cop out of the sort of stuff just because they can I just demonstrating to everyone around them that they are taking a lackluster tack with the class. it doesn't sound like they are asking you to pray to a god you don't believe in, or pledge your allegiance to the evil empire.

I'm going to say NAH. This is a really shitty situation and you are justified in being angry and sad, but as you said, it was an accident. I do think it will be better for you not to rush to adopt a new dog though. Take some time to sort out your emotions and process the death of your friend. Also, I wouldn't be too hard on your mom for not being receptive to getting a new dog; your mom is likely traumatized by this as well, and it's possible that she just does not feel comfortable having another dog around so soon after what happened."

dim81p,"NTA. I think what he did was dodgy and unprofessional. But it's mostly creepy because of what we're scared it could turn into, not because of what it actually was. It sounds like it *could be* the start of a workplace harassment story, but in itself, it was just a guy awkwardly flirting and paying a girl a compliment, then agreeing to stop when she said it made her uncomfortable.

So, you want to be cautious and prepared. But I also don't think you should go into full-on defence mode over something that isn't actually that big a deal.

And honestly (get ready to downvote) being hit on, complimented and then left alone is *not* a big deal. For anyone. If it truly makes someone *that* uncomfortable, I think that's more to do with their fears, rather than a reasonable reaction to the actual situation. It's a problem when someone persists, sure.

dimf57,"NTA (It was everybody sucks until that end part). Yes, the GF should definitely wash the dishes that she left making food (basic courtesy 100% agree).

If the chores were assigned fairly, I'd say you should suck it up and do those extra dishes (sometimes there's a lot, sometimes a little, but if it's your responsibility it's better to just do it).

But, that part about your brother not having to do basically anything, while you have daily chores because *women have to do more chores* is clearly not fair. So, that takes precedence over everything else, imo, because you shouldn't have to do the extra work in the first place."
dimgq1,"I’m gonna say YTA even though you should rehome the dog. 

You’re an asshole for getting a pet with absolutely no intention of taking care of it forever. A dog is for life and I’m always going to call someone an asshole for getting one without the intention of keeping it. 

I get that life happens and sometimes a dog isn’t feasible, but you chose to get a pet and should work around that, not get rid of it as soon as you can afford to live in a nicer area. 

That being said, you don’t seem to actually love this pet at all. As a result, it would probably be better off and have a happier life with someone who will love it. 

Rehome the dog, but you’re still an asshole."
dimgzv,"YTA

You have a new baby, being able to have uninterrupted hours to relax is over.

She is at home, looking after a baby, its not time off (no matter what you think) and in many cases going to work is easier/better than staying at home, you get adult conversation, company, not having to be constantly on edge making sure the new human you pushed out doesn't do something to hurt itself.

She doesn't get breaks like you would at work, I'd be pissed if my husband acted the way you are when we had our baby."

Don't do that. Your boyfriend is 100% responsible for his own thoughts and actions. 

Maybe your boyfriend's attitude has changed, you've been together a long time and people grow and grow apart sadly. It's no ones fault.

You have a bit of a 'jealous girlfriend' vibe about you at the moment, talk to your boyfriend and leave Amy out of it."

Your arguments are very flawed and not based on medical knowledge. Carbon monoxide (CO) is not carcinogenic and CO toxicity is not cumulative like radiation or other carcinogenic compounds. With that said, there is indeed a risk of gas leaks, fires or even explosions if the ventilation in the room is not adequate, and these can be dangerous."
dioazt,"NTA. “Accidents happen” would be a more valid excuse if you hadn’t already explicitly told her to stop leaving food out on more than one occasion, that’s just being irresponsible."
dioc68,"YTA 

My answer varies slightly based on how long you guys have been together but not much. 

If they don’t want to have other people chime in on an argument, they should argue in front of other people.  So your boyfriend isn’t an asshole for speaking up in my opinion. 


I think you and your family are assholes for subjecting him to family arguments and then telling him to keep his mouth shut.    I’d give you the cold shoulder too"

List of reasons others are a hole:

1. Bullying is never ok.
2. BF doesn't stand up for you.
3. Ganging up nature.
4. Generally making you feel rubbish.
5. You are 18 they are 30. Doesn't matter how mature you are you are likely going to annoy them because you are a kid. This is an abusive relationship. 

List of reasons you are a hole:

1. I don't give a flying fuck how you are feeling you don't not take your meds. If you know you forget set phone reminders.
2. You keep yourself in this toxic scenario with a man 12 years your senior.
3. You drink whilst on meds for anxiety and depression. Don't drink on those meds.
4. Your behaviour has caused all of these individuals to be annoyed with you. I am assuming this is on them but it is worth being self aware to an extent.

Get out of this mess of a relationship and learn to be happy by yourself THEN learn to be happy in a relationship. Doing the reverse ALWAYS ends in disaster at some point."

This is how bigots stay bigots. When they look around at what they've been doing, and then try to improve, and the people they treated poorly, who they look to now for some kind of measure of how they should be acting, shit right on them. All it does is reaffirm to them that they were originally right to treat you the way they did because you're an asshole. (Edit: let me be clear, this is justification for their behavior in their mind. I don't think anything justifies the way they treated you OP.)

Go do a quick google search of Daryl Davis, and see how your method of telling them to fuck off stacks up against his methods.

You don't have to forgive them, that's entirely your prerogative, but when someone comes to you of their own accord trying to end a cycle of hate, and your response is ""fuck you, let's keep this hate going"", then you are 100% TA."

dippma,"ESH He should take more care if his hygiene, but you could be more subtle. 

Poor personal hygiene is often a sign of depression or things going wrong at home. You should raise it with him, but be kind. Tell him you really admire his talent. Tell him you aren't trying to be cruel, but as a friend you want him to know he can be a bit smelly at times and that maybe more people could see what a great guy he is if he took a bit more pride in his appearance.  Maybe start by asking if everything is okay at home.

If you don't feel you can tell him yourself, or you are worried about him talk to a teacher and tell them you're concerned and finding it hard to work with him.

It's a really sensitive issue. If you deal with it well you are doing him a favour, but it could be really hurtful if you are negative and judgemental.
