dhio14,NTA Is she expecting everyone to give her rides everywhere when she travels as a family? That's odd. Is there no public transportation?
dhip6u,"> maybe I have a problem, maybe I’m addicted to sex or pornography, this are question I don’t have the answers to

These might be questions you should find out the answer to. 3-4 times a day is a LOT of sex, even for the beginning of a relationship. And correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like at least once you were watching porn on your phone while in her company? Also, live cams are not the same as regular porn given the interaction component and I'm not surprised she's upset about those especially if it's a recurring issue.

I'm gonna say YTA because it does sound like you have a real problem and you seem to be aware that might be the case, so get evaluated and get some help if you need it."
dhipqr,NTA. You're allowed to make noise in your apartment.
dhirwi,"YTA, obviously. You moved away from your children and started a new life without them, and then have the audacity to get upset that they resent you for it. You don’t think the 18 and 17 year olds you abandoned needed you as much as your 5 year old does?"
dhitby,"NTA

What the hell...she purchased a gift for herself, not you."
dhivxy,[deleted]
dhiwcu,NTA because she could have been a big girl and used her big girl words to let you know she was intending to get them and was only waiting for someone to come reach them for her.
dhiwjl,NTA surely it's disrespecting her religion more if you pray even though you don't believe in it?
dhiyn5,"NTA - As a person who grew up with a father who was *a bad person*, **morally, and ethically**, but not abusive, or necessarily criminal, I understand. I don't want my father in my, or my child's life, either. You have the right to say ""This person causes me harm"" / ""This person is toxic in my life"", and choose not to interact with them, and any attempt to undermine this is basic manipulative gaslightling. It's mildly abusive, and not okay. Your boundaries with your family are not strictly speaking her business, if they are no longer part of your life."
dhj02y,"NTA, you want to talk big like a man expect it back"
dhj2gd,"I'm gonna say YTA, but hear me out. You are of course not the asshole for having this sensitivity or communicating / enforcing this rule. 

HOWEVER. People are sensitive about sex and their bodies, even men, and the way you wrote this post is pretty... insensitive. I get that your nose is hypersensitive and I'll buy that, but that isn't common, and so what your boyfriend is going to be *experiencing* whether you intend it or not is your constant disgust with his odor / genitals, especially in instances where he showered only hours prior. That's going to make him feel hurt and likely defensive, especially if you speak to him about this as abrasively as you write about it in this post.  

If you care about your partner and your relationship, you'd do well to exercise sensitivity about this subject with him, and try to find ways to make it (1) clear that this is your thing and not about him, and (2) make it sexy - remind him to shower so you can go crazy on him after, or join him in the shower once in a while. 


To be clear - he has no right to be pushy about sex and try to get you to do things you don't want - but you should also take care not to say things like ""tough luck"" and ""I want to wretch"" in reference to this issue if you want to have a healthy & loving sex life with this man."
dhj38r,"I’m leaning towards YTA. Even though your dad bought the cat for your family, you forfeited your rights when you didn’t care what happened to your cat FOR YEARS. During this time, your cat was taken care of by another family who seems to care about it much more than you do. 

Also, if you truly worried about your cat, you wouldn’t have let it outdoors laissez-faire like that. Indoor cats are from disease and accidents and can live a fulfilling life with the right care and entertainment."
dhj47i,"NAH but it's not really a big deal to throw in your well wishes even though they're repetitive. If you feel like saying ""happy birthday"" is too chorus-y, switch it up. Ask them if they've had a good birthday, if they're doing anything to celebrate."
dhj6ux,"NAH. He’s a little kid who was trying to be friendly, but didn’t know better. You could have used a nicer tone, but he needs to learn that’s inappropriate, so no big deal. Just try to be nicer if a similar situation every arises. Remember they don’t know bette rand they’re just trying to be friendly. They should absolutely be corrected, but preferably in a nice tone. I don’t blame you for accidentally snapping though because nobody wants someone grabbing their belt and it can be a very instinctual reaction."
dhj7ue,"NTA. If everyone is aware of your birthday, than it's not your fault you don't want to spend the day of YOUR BIRTHDAY with them. Your partner knew your plans, he's the asshole."
dhj9c3,"So you'll continue justifying driving against the flow of traffic, which you know could cause an accident, however unlikely it might be, because it's more convenient? 

YTA. Please stop before you seriously injure someone."
dhjalp,"NTA, she was way worse in that situation, getting very personal. You made a throwaway comment that happens online all the time."
dhjayw,"NTA. At 2, Ava won't enjoy having to sit still and be quiet (if her mom bothers to tell her so), and she's too young to remember it when she grows up anyway."
dhjbhd,"YTA but only a little bit - all the way through I was wondering if you'd even bothered to ask if she could come  - seeing that you didn't and vaguely know you should have is what landed me at my judgement. 

If you hadn't done the international thing I'd agree it's unreasonable for her to want to go on every trip with you, but that's clearly a huge hurdle in your relationship that you're both still recovering from - during this recovery period you do have to make a visible concerted effort to make her feel wanted and included. 

She was specifically excited about accompanying you to out of state tournaments, it's not like you can say she wouldn't have been interested

I kind of sympathise with her too - I had a similar but different thing happen and while I'm ""over"" it it still takes effort not to blow up when they talk about the trip

Also, this is totally unsolicited advice, but this far into a relationship, where travel is an important emotional topic, you might do well to start checking in with her before you say yes to things. It might lead to less friction - instead of just saying yes to your friends then telling your significant other ""I'm going on a trip next weekend"" it would be far more considerate to tell your friends you need to check your schedule, finding out if there's a way to bring your girlfriend along unobtrusively, then go to your gf and say ""some tournament friends have invited me along to a tournament to cut costs, but there's only one spot - do we have any plans I'm forgetting about next weekend because I'd really like to go"" might get you wayyyy farther"
dhjhaj,"NTA. However if this is someone you still want to be friends with you need to be really careful in passing across this message. I’d say have the conversation one more time with her letting her know, that if this pattern continues you would need to have your space back explaining the situation with work and all."
dhjiq3,"NTA but it's kind of besides the point. There are clearly systemic staffing / management issues there that you sticking around to serve wouldn't have helped, especially while injured and recovering. 

If your GM / corporate don't understand that there's a larger issue and instead want to pin it all on you not working your 25th hour in 48, then this isn't a place you want to be working anyway."
dhjlnv,"Yes YTA, holy hell.

Your stepson is suffering from an embarrassing problem and is twice as frustrated as you that he can't control his incontinence. Instead of being helpful and understanding, you're upset that he's upset about something he can't control. 

And make no mistake-- him saying that he's ""been doing it on purpose"" is a way for him to regain some semblance of control over his bladder. Instead of seeing it for the cry for help it is, you're ""fed up."" 

And you want to buy him pampers instead of toys to humiliate and punish him. That's a *child.* And you're a huge asshole."
dhjmal,"ESH. Him for just being a jerk, you for reinforcing stereotypes that literally get dogs killed."
dhjmi4,NTA. You agreed to stay on for a time to help them out as a show of good faith. They're punishing your good deed.
dhjpuv,"ESH. You knew she didn’t want other people to see the picture and you sent it anyway. Even if you didn’t think it’s a big deal, she is self conscious of it. Also, F2 probably felt bad about accidentally sending it out, which is why she may be siding with F1. F1, in my opinion, is blowing this way out of proportion, but maybe she has a really good reason for hating that picture we don’t know about. 

I would apologize again and say you didn’t know how much it would bother her and if you had known you wouldn’t have sent it. And that you value your friendship and would like to move forward. If she is still upset after all that time and a second apology, I’m not sure what to do."
dhjqbb,"Your partner cares more about competing with their siblings than taking a comfortable, financially sound next step with their partner. I hope you think twice about marrying this person."
dhjs9o,"NTA, not your fault he choose to go no vacation not pay down his debt and let it grow"
dhjsok,"NTA if he'd booked it just for himself and cancelled with less than 24 hours notice there are barely any hotels that would have given him a refund, why should you pay extra because he cancelled?"
dhjtdl,"NTA. Look, you are *definitely* overreacting. A cooked turkey heart is gross, but not cry-in-the-bathroom traumatizing. Your grandmother should have apologized as it was a mean thing to do in light of your sensitivity to gross things, but it was a *joke.* Next time, just verbalize your feelings instead of resorting to giving your grandma the cold shoulder."
dhjuxz,"NTA; at first neighbors were right to not let you in seeing as they didn't know who you were. After that they became very petty and imo, bitchy. For your sake I hope they lock themselves out of their flat one day."
dhk2ex,NTA - Having autism doesn’t mean you can be a shitty person
dhk2vh,"NTA. 

It's called Monopoly, not Corporation. It's literally meant for 1 single person to win, not two or a group. It's one thing when it was just between the both of them, but when it starts affecting other people's ability to win the game, it's too far."

dhkb4p,"Definitely YTA, and I think you know it based on your attempt to justify why you took the money in this post.

EDIT: your double TA now that we know that this guy giving you money has a crush on you."
dhkcj3,"You’d be the ass if you weren’t annoyed by this guy.  There’s one in every cohort. Talk to the instructor about it. It’s not really your place to pull him up unless the instructor has given him the hard word. If he still keeps it up, you mind have to band together with other students to shut him down.

dhkf8p,"NTA. She seems insecure about your relationship, probably why she's being controlling. That ain't ok. Also what's the point of keeping streaks just to keep streaks?"
dhkg7b,"YTA

Your fiancee doesn't want to spend the night with you before marriage.

dhkoj5,"NAH as long as you’re supportive and don’t make him feel bad about transitioning.  Basically you’ve just found out that the person you knew for a long time doesn’t really exist and that someone else was under all that, which can be difficult to wrap your head around.  It’s nobody’s fault but it’s understandable that you’d be upset"
dhkpru,"YTA - Saying it to his face, not over a post on social media, would have been a lot better."
dhksqf,"NTA if you confronted her. It could be best to do some kind of intervention though, since you say she's a hot-headed person."
dhkv4t,"ESH, she was being irresponsible, and you took it a bit too far on the language. I understand that you are scarred from the death of your friend, I really understand that, but you also have to understand that you have to control and respect. You could’ve scolded her and told her your concern, but ask yourself this, was the insulting and profanity really necessary?"
dhl2mw,"NTA.  You are not responsible for supporting your mom.  Because your mom is being unhealthy about it, and I am a mom of kids about your age, I’ll say what she should be saying: Go out and start your life with Kat and don’t worry about home because that’s not your job.  Don’t spend more than you earn, try to build up a decent savings, and be sure to take care of your health even though it seems like you’ll live forever now.  Don’t be a dick and make good choices.  Try to leave a positive mark on the things you do and the people you encounter.  Never ever make a decision based on fear or guilt.  Best of luck to you!"

dhl6ox,"NAH you can ask but she is within her rights to say no. Fragrance sensitivity is a thing, and in-between now and the wait for testing (assuming it's like my situation and you're looking at a 3 month wait, lol) you can be doing more in the mean time to manage the situation. 

1. Take a non-drowsy anti allergen in the morning. Every morning. I also have a daily nasal spray.
2. Get a cortisone cream to alleviate the itching symptoms.

dhld36,"NTA. From the sound of it, they called you just try and get a ride, not to actually see you. If the first thing they said was they needed a ride, they should accept your price. If the Ubers were, in fact, $100 then $45 is still better than taking an Uber. Seeing as they hung up after your response I feel like they were lowballing you and just wanted a cheap ride. Bad friends are the ones who try and take advantage of a friend, they're the ones that need to reevaluate their values.

Your father had well founded fears about you being on social media at a young age. It's not that he doesn't trust you it's that he cannot trust others and being young you are vulnerable prey. No way is this an insult, just a reality.

dhr3fv,"ESH.... But could also be ""not the asshole."" 

The kid sounds like he needs to get his shit together. He's a ""beer and pretzels"" gamer at a serious table. I think you need to contact your DM and explain everything calmly, and request that the DM communicates to the other player that he needs to ""buckle down."" 

Still, it wasn't cool of you to lose it on him in the middle of the gaming session. You were right to say no, as it is your character's property. But you should have waited to go OOC until after everything was said and done.

You might even just contact him directly and explain everything to him while you're calm.

I understand how frustrating shitty players are. Good luck."
dhr4ut,YTA. Not because you didn’t pay for their stuff. But because you cut in line (even if someone else offered) and then bought all the bagels that were left. This means people who were there before you and waited in line now won’t get any bagels. That’s really inconsiderate of you.

Ignore the text or say you are not their limo driver. Be firm and they will eventually stop asking. However.

dhsfiu,"YTA. You sound like one of those people who describe themselves as ""brutally honest"" which in reality just means they are an asshole to people.

There's a nice way to communicate this, and a mean way to communicate it. A nice way could be something like ""I'm not comfortable calling you dad and I don't think I will ever be, but I'm very happy to have you in our lives.""

A mean or cold way could be ""I'm never going to call you dad. You don't replace my dad. I won't ever consider you my dad because you aren't my blood.""

I doubt either of them ever expected you to call him dad but you didn't have to be such a dick about it."
dhsirv,"YTA- you didn’t even warn your husband you’d thrown out the margarine, you didn’t have to throw out the two tubs you already have, just finish them and move to a different brand. You went a bit psycho for no reason and I don’t think you’re in the right."

Based on that, I’m inclined to believe it wasn’t a bad storm, and you’re just whining because of some rain. Also, if you can’t drive a bike in rain, why do you have it?

At age 11 kids should definitely know that stealing and breaking things that don't belong to you is wrong.  At 5, maybe a bit less, but still that's a terrible excuse.

You know you're being manipulative.  And having worked in construction myself, if he tells his boss he's too tired to work and it might be dangerous for him and others, most bosses will send him home and not pay him.  He's right that it will set a bad precedent for him and his reputation.  People don't want to hire workers they can't rely on, and it's on him to make sure he's fit for work everyday.  Telling his boss he's too tired to work doesn't mean he gets sent to a desk job for the day, it means he gets sent home and maybe fired.  You're trying to fix the wrong problem here.  It's his sleeping habits he needs to change, not telling his boss he's tired."

On a side note, you should ask yourself if this dude is worth being in a relationship with. Some people are late a lot, some people smoke weed a lot, not really big things on their own. But he just sounds like he has a huge lack of motivation and is unwilling to change (and upset by you helping)"
dhtg7s,"This might be booed and downvoted a lot but to be completely honest, I dont give a rat's furry little derriere.

You have a NTA here. I used to be obese all through highschool, basically entered and exited puberty well above any form of ideal weight. To clarify I was never near the morbid line, but was still large enough to cause lasting damage to my skin and most importantly to my joints, I was basically raised to believe that I should eat as much and as often as I wanted and that would be fine.

As much as being candidly called fat by my father at that point would have hurt, being allowed to destroy my health was much, MUCH worse. I had to really develop health issues to get a hang of myself at the age of 21. I'm a pretty fit guy at the moment but that kind of fat does lasting damage and people who glorify it are much worse for society and the individual, compared to those trying to ""shame"" you into shape.

Keep on through with your efforts to help your daughter, if you truly believe she might be going through emotional issues go-ahead talk to her, if it's not straight forward enough for you to handle it on your own, suggest therapy, it will show when she's older and she will be very grateful, I wish you the best of luck with your endeavour, wish I had someone like you when it mattered."

dhv0ag,"I've worked in animal behavior for over 2 decades. 

I can tell you that as hard as it is for you to see your dog put down, it's harder for your dog.  Dogs ALWAYS look around the room trying to find ""their person,"" so I always try to encourage owners to be there in their pet's last moments. 

We can't hide from sad things. This very sad moment is part of what you signed up for when you welcomed a pet into your life. I know it is heartbreakingly sad. There are few things in life sadder. But almost everyone I've ever spoken to about it (and I've done studies on this) has said ultimately they were happy they could be there in that moment for their pet, and also for the other family members who were there. It is better to be sad you did something, than to be sad to missed something.

I can't make an official ""asshole"" judgment either way... nobody is an asshole in this situation. I do hope you'll attend, and your mom, your other sibling, and your dog will all appreciate it from their hearts.

I'm so, so, sorry you're going through this. 💗"

dhv11i,"NTA

It's a conflict for you. Honestly this is smart on your part as it would add an extra layer of contention in your relationship."
dhv20u,"NTA. Your mom seems to view her [estranged] family as *hers*, and is angry that you're building relationships with them independently of her. She probably is losing her sense of control over the situation as a result. Clearly she didn't care about seeing you regularly or *ever* seeing her niece until the two of you were creating a relationship not defined by *her*. (I'm guessing this behavior is not out of character for your mom, and she's generally someone who wants to call all the shots in her relationships?) The parting shot of ""I'm used to my family disappointing me"" is the wording of someone who is used to behaving manipulatively, though it's almost laughably transparent in terms of an attempt at manipulation.

All that to say, your mom sounds like she has a highly dysfunctional outlook on family relationships, and you should probably keep her on an information diet regarding future get-togethers with your cousin and aunt. Given that your mom is estranged from that branch of the family, it's not like she's likely to hear about them from other channels anyway, so this is probably the best way to keep the peace.

Edited to add: I agree with other comments here that your mom sounds like she may have narcissistic tendencies. It might be worth looking up personally checklists and seeing if the described traits track. Of course, you can't diagnose someone yourself on the internet, but after I figured out a particular relative of mine was (likely) a narcissist, it made it *so* much easier to understand their behavior and deal with them."
dhv4f1,NTA. the situation is dangerous for your health.

When you're house-sitting it is always the responsible thing to do to ask for permission before bringing over guests.  And no, just because he didn't specifically say ""No"" doesn't mean it's ok.  That's some immature thinking on your part and something manipulative people pull. That's on you.  So not only did you invite someone over without asking first, you also got naked in his jacuzzi with your BF.  So of course he's going to drain it and be pissed.  You already broke his trust by bringing over a guest without asking, so why should he trust you when you say you didn't fuck in his jacuzzi?"

Particularly as you don't believe in the whole godparent thing.  I'd tell them both there will be no godparents period."
dhxt1r,I'd phrase it to your parents like you want to instill responsibility into your brother. You could clean the room if they'd like but you really feel your brother will learn more about personal responsibility if he has to clean up his personal messes. Framing it like you want to help your brother grow as a person instead of wanting to avoid chores.
dhxxo0,"I’m going to go with ESH.  Based on what I just read it seems like you both have some communication issues and lack of coping skills. While I can completely empathize with your situation as I’ve been in similar ones, I think you also need to learn how to not force your expectations on other people. He obviously needs to learn how to communicate with you about what he needs in those times as well."
dhy0k1,"NTA.  Why would your friend assume you should miss work and take care of his dog when you don't even like dogs?  You had no control over the bus not taking his dog, so that wasn't your problem to solve, either.  Your friend needs to grow up and take responsibility for his own dog."
dhy19k,"YTA. 

You are being insecure. She will not be “groped” - it’s ACTING. 

Everything on stage is made to look real, when it is in fact not."
dhy1t4,"NTA Why on earth he'd burn a migraine trigger is beyond me. He has to take more care and ensure he only uses the right stuff.

 I have specific food triggers and my husband wouldn't dream of using them in cooking, which is pretty analogous to your situation.

Hope the migraine gets better soon"
dhy6kb,"NTA, you have all the rights to be angry. She walked out and then expects you to just let her back into your life as if she did nothing wrong? That's fucked."
dhy7zq,NTA.  This keeps you alive.
dhya63,YTA you have care right? She doesn't leave you hanging? Get over it?
dhydpc,"By doing that am I not sending the message that it’s okay for her to be disrespectful towards me? I was willing to talk to her when she called for N’s bday, she hung up on me."
dhyjc5,"NTA 

You know what you want for a good reason, that’s all there is to say."
dhyjqu,"YTA

I notice you left your age out... lol

But yes, getting mad at not getting free thing always makes you TA.

There are any number of reasons why they might not want you to have a phone, they are valid to them.

Did you get a job?  Offer to chip in?  Or just ""why no gimme thing??"""
dhynd8,"NTA she's 23 she's got to get it together sometime.

Diapers in the floor? 1 diaperleft in the floor 10 minutes after changing is too much for me. I can handle sloppiness pretty well but not that."
dhyqbl,"ESH-kinda

They suck for choosing such a stupid hill to potentially literally die on

You suck for trying to police your friends amd being insistent after their refusal, even with the best of intentions.

You can lead a horse to water, but you cant make it drink"
dhyqh7,"NTA. I understand the resentment for your father all too well. Your wedding is your day, remember that. Do whatever you know is going to make YOU happiest on that day. Good luck:)"
dhys27,"your age is glaring. yta. your brother is 3yrs old! he’s a toddler! of course he’s a brat lol. newsflash: you are also a brat! stop hurting your baby brother ffs. he shouldn’t be doing chores because he’s a fucking toddler! you should be doing those chores. also? i know you’re 13 and still a child but like... nobody believes that “i changed this summer!” 

good heavens i feel for your poor mother in my soul."
dhytba,"It's (at least) the second day in a row you were going to have sex and you stop in the middle to complain she's not interested enough in you??

I'm too confused to even give a judgement."
dhyv5t,"YTA but only because it’s been 2 years. Next time, don’t wait until you’re leaving to report disgusting behavior and don’t accept in action from HR or management after reporting it. As far as his wife goes, she probably already knows."
dhyyov,"NTA. Call up your brother and agree on an exit plan. That way no one gets stuck holding the proverbial bag. Then you both need to go over there and lay it out for her:

- Neither of you will be taking care of her after x date. 

- She needs to work with the hospital/insurance/whoever to arrange weekly assistance. 

- She needs to spend her money wisely and treat people kindly because neither one of you will be back as her caregiver.

Call and visit her as you see fit and take care of yourself."
dhz0t5,"YTA, it wasn't an emergency. It wasn't life or death. Your mum was trying to make you feel better most likely."
dhz365,"YWBTA for taking someone else’s dog. That’s not your place at all. That’s just stealing someone’s dog.
 
NTA for telling mom. She needs to know he’s not in a safe space."
dhz4ah,"Lol, wat?

Your fabric analogy is spot on. NTA"
dhzdwz,"NTA for not telling your friend, her parents were the ones with valid information on her condition, location, etc and anything you told her would only make her stressed without calling her parents for more information anyways. However, YTA for not accepting your judgments and arguing with anyone who disagrees with you."
dhzr7l,"I would be more concerned as to why Sam is being allowed to run roughshod through the workplace unchecked, particularly in light of their racist comments. 

You might not have a formal HR department, but your higher-ups need to know.

NTA."
dhzrd1,"YTA, 100%. ""She's pretty because she doesn't have something you have and want more of."" Your girlfriend wanting piercings isn't going to mess her face up, they're temporary and most leave minimal scarring at most if she *decides* to take them out, but it's just that--her decision. Do you hate piercings more than you like having a girlfriend, because you're on your way to being single, or at least I hope so, for her sake."
dhzrth,"YTA, always consider the weight of your words, especially when you're taking about events as important as your wedding. You may have said it flippantly and not meant anything by it, but she heard that your anniversary meant nothing because it wasn't a big milestone."
dhztfm,"Yeah I was trying to remember that, because I don't want my son to be left out and go without. But I also don't want him to be like my neices who have said ""is that it?"" After opening all their presents. It's tough to find a middle ground."
dhzukl,NTA. it's not that hard to explain to kids. I did when my daughter was about the same age and saw a gay couple on TV. She was just stoked to find out she could marry her favourite teacher now lol
dhzumk,NTA and I’m with you. Not funny.
dhzw31,"YTA- 2 in 3 people have tattoos now , at least in the western world. Only ""nice guys"" see women with tattoos as anything other than just that."
dhzw3s,"NTA...not even sure why you’d think you were, totally ok and nothing wrong with your thought process here."
dhzxn6,"NTA, but if you want to be completely free and clear, just ask her if she wants it back. Chances are she probably doesn't--she can't return it at this point, she can't re-gift it with the note (unless she were to remove it, too), and it's just a reminder of you and the breakup."
dhzy5m,"NTA, you had no bad intentions. You didn’t see him, if he was waiting on that spot you probably should have moved but you didn’t know and he wasn’t consolable. he was grossly overreacting. He shouldn’t have been screaming and yelling at you repeatedly but the line “fucking asshole with your brain in your ass” is hilarious! You did the right thing it’s best not to get involved in those types of confrontations."
di00uq,"NTA simply for reporting inappropriate behavior in public to a security guard. 

But your detail about their disabilities/perceived disabilities makes me super uneasy. You are definitely an asshole if you reported them for any other reason than what I stated above. Ask yourself, would you have reporting two people without disabilities making out?"
di0309,Please try to write actual sentences instead of giant run on sentences that are a jumble of words. That said. ESH. You for being glad at a family members health issues. And him for forcing you to do things you really didn’t want to do. That’s what it boils down too. You both suck. Stand up for yourself and don’t play. Worst case he grounds you. Big deal.
di07w3,You’re not an asshole for denying him separate lines. YTA for how you handled it. You could have just said there’s one line and you were next. You don’t need to be rude right off the bat.
di0bc1,NTA. Your parents’ lack of financial planning isn’t your issue to solve.
di0bvn,"ESH. First, you don’t drop your child off without assuring they make it into the house and you at least see an adult. Second, you don’t make plans without clearing them with the person they’ll effect. Third, you really should’ve had your phone charged."
di0e96,"YTA. No one has to say a prayer if they don’t want to. And it’s not even your kid, so you overstepped. 

In my opinion, the correct “teaching moment” would have been to tell him that he doesn’t need to pray but please be courteous as the rest of the family does."
di0fft,YTA. Stop being a brat. She was probably ready to be done with the day.
di0jao,"NTA. Break up with this guy. He is keeping you secret for a reason, and it is not sustainable. 

Honestly, I'd go to his fam and introduce yourself as the GF. The fall out will tell you why you're a secret."
di0n2l,"NAH

A lot of people offer things and then regret those choices or get wrapped up in their own thing. It sucks, but it happens.

Just shoot her a text -

""You once offered to do my hair and makeup, which I'm super thankful for because you're amazing at it. Theres only 3 weeks to go, I still need a cut and dye, and we haven't gone over options and I'm kinda stressing out. 

If youd rather not do it, or dont have time, it's okay honestly, I just need to know so I can organize something else. If you can though, can we get together and talk things over? I'm free X, y, or Z. If those dont work let me know some options for you.

Thank you again!"""
di0p14," > i've never been the type to work hard in school

Honestly YTA.  It seems like you didn't even try.

Also sorry about your Dad."
di0tii,"NTA but at what point are you going to learn and close off access to your accounts and stop giving him money and pay your own bills? If you don't put your foot down when it first happens, you're basically saying it's okay."
di0yzw,"Your parents are dumb

NTA"
di0yzz,"NAH - You can ask him, but don’t expect to get a good response. I would go with the “conditions” rather than asking him to outright NOT smoke in the apartment. Explain why it’s bothering you and see if there’s a compromise that can be worked out. 

Regardless - it’s his apartment and he can do what he wants, but the same can be said for you. If you’re both paying an equal amount, it’s fair to want to set conditions, considering you have logical reasons behind it."
di0zog,"NAH, he's 16.  He probably doesn't even want to be at the party.  Let it go, this isn't a fight worth having."
di118v,NTA but last I checked people in the military get paid so I don't understand why you have to pay for everything.
di11ex,"NTA -- Is he that childish that he can't spend a couple of nights without you by his side, while he sleeps, knowing he has a contagious illness? Sounds like a selfish dude."
di121p,Nta if she can't take care of them she don't deserve them. Just imagine what the inside of her house looks like. Her health is an issue as well
di12a5,"NAH. I don't know you but I'm going to be direct. If everything you're saying is true, you might be depressed. He wants to help but doesn't know how. I'd advise professional help. It can get better but you may just need a little extra help to figure out how. Nothing wrong with that."
di136j,"YTA  People accidentally spell names wrong sometimes. Hell, my Grandma ordered my Grandpa's headstone with his name spelled wrong on it (this was 3 years after his death, so it isn't like she was in the throes of grief). 

People make mistakes. What is the big deal?"
di15tf,"This definitely seems like a validation post since no one would actually call you the asshole.

If you want advice, you need a different thread. Truthfully though, you should focus on protecting yourself. She's hurting you. Ask her to stop to protect yourself. Her taking her anger out on others or threatening to leave the family is not on you."
di16on,"NTA. I’m amazed she even tried to justify not paying you back. If you ask to borrow money, especially 2,000 dollars of if, you should be planning to pay it back that day."
di18jp,"NTA: Welcome to an issue that every person (mostly adults) juggle with all of the time. It is your resource and your choice on how you want to use it. There will be times you will choose to give, times you give when you really shouldn't, and times when you really don't have the resources to give. For me, the hardest decisions are the times when you decide to not give; especially if/when the resources are there.

I find it rather mature of you in already seeing a pattern with this person and understanding the balancing of resources you and others are having to juggle to continue in giving to this person. Especially in contrast to their efforts in providing for themselves.

What will differentiate between you coming across as an asshole or not will be how you move forward and their receptiveness to it. As a friend, be honest and straight forward, compassionate in your delivery too. Try to not make the other person feel bad and never use hurtful terms or expressions. Being in a position of need often is a vulnerable spot. You may have to choose to do different things, free things, if you want to continue doing things together.

Lastly you may find that this is not a friend you would like to continue to have due to what is important to you in a friendship.

None of this is easy.
Good luck and hopefully you have a situation where this friendship only gets stronger by being honest and thoughtful in how you move forward.

:-)"
di18us,"ESH. 

You’re NTA for not buying him a gift, and he’s TA for questioning you about it. But you’re definitely overestimating how generous you’re being for buying him a beer, and totally TA for asking him to pay you back.

I’ve sent you a Venmo bill for my time."
di19g4,"NTA. She uses the n-word openly in a public profile. It's not a matter of, what if her profile were private, because the fact of the matter is that you *don't* know what she keeps private, you only know what she puts out there, and what she puts out there is abhorrent.

Plus, even if that weren't all the case, she sounds like a brat. Not calling back after three calls, and then being irritable and demanding an explanation from you? Nonsense."
di1bxz,"NTA... But you should know that depending on what career you want, there might be a grain of  truth to what they said. Some professions/companies can be much more restrained in what’s okay in terms of tattoos, piercings and hair dyes than others."
di1f7p,"NTA

It sounds like you both agreed she would be home by 3 because you have to run to work for an hour. You can’t leave kids alone, so she has to get home. Her making it home by 4, you needing to spend an hour at work, and her having to be at work by 5 does not add up unless one of you is taking the kids with you. 

She can always see her friends next week. 

She honestly sounds more manipulative, trying to make you feel bad for expecting her to follow the agreed upon time."
di1f7w,"> I told the doc that I had a wedding I had to go to, but he told me don't go

You asked your doctor if you could go to the wedding and he said no. Did you tell the family member that and she still chewed you out?

NTA"
di1j11,"Your mom should have called first.

NTA"
di1m5l,You’re boyfriend is TA.  You didn’t know. I don’t like people touching my stuff without asking
di1pts,NTA.  Your parents didn’t try to take you to a different dentist at a young age to figure out the issue?  How awful.
di1rhh,"YWBTA.  Say nothing about them possibly over-paying. Whatever they paid, they were pleased to do it. If you say anything, it could be read as you're thinking the gift is cheap since you'd be pointing out how inexpensive it can be gotten for.  If they paid the lower price, you would be putting them on the spot. Keep the gift if you like it and my vote is to say nothing."
di208s,"NTA. We have the same issues, my wife has to be up at four to leave by five every morning for work. She sets her clothes out in the en suite bathroom before bed and changes and test ready in there while I sleep (I work from home and don’t have to be up until 8) 

Works great. She gets up, gets ready and is off to work and I never wake while she is. 

And likewise when she’s off and sleeps in, I change in the bathroom or out in the house to let her sleep. It’s all about compromise and doing that little bit extra for the one who doesn’t have to be up so early."
di20gz,"I think this is the wrong sub for this. This is a complex friendship and mental health situation  there are no assholes here, so NAH."
di229x,"NTA.
You clearly feel close enough to knife to consider them a friend, and from what i gathered from the setup, you arent supposed to know people very well in the groups. It seems like you were only following the rules. I suppose my only question is is there a punishment for being conflicted? If not, then you are 100% NTA"
di23yo,"Yeah, YTA. It’s not the oppression olympics. No one gets to be the winner."
di24pt,"This reeks of teenage insecurity... however NAH. You’re not an asshole for wanting to talk to friends. She clearly feels that their is a precedent for this request, as she consults you about the same thing. If I were you, I’d focus less on if you’re an asshole and more on finding out why she’s insecure."

di2bc6,"NAH yet, I don't think.  She doesn't have to feel comfortable, but maybe sometimes that means she has to wait.  If you're not in a rush, feel free to say ""sure"", if not, say ""sorry, I'm in a rush, you'll have to wait for the next one"".  

I don't think that her phobia automatically gives her priority over you, but this is something that a) won't come up that often, and b) isn't that big of a deal unless you decide to make it one out of principle.  In which case you'd kind of be an asshole."
di2c4h,"NAH - I've been drugged at a bar before and I have indeed gone to the bar after, however the friends I went with didn't know it had happened to me and I couldn't talk him out of the bar without telling him the story.

My real question is why do you want to go to this bar so bad? Is it made of gold? Are their drinks so strong you see god? Are you curious what kind of bar people get drugged at? 

Just think on that, and then make sure K doesn't find out, no matter what. It's been a year but if they didn't catch who did it it's not long enough for the wound to heal."
di2gwq,"YTA he's clearly self-conscious about his posture. Let it go. Talk to him about it in private maybe, or just let him live his life. 

I'm self-conscious about my posture (which isn't even that bad, though it used to be) and when anyone tells me to stand up straight, it makes me want to slouch more to hide. 

Also, you suck for being so concerned about being taller than him. If you like him, like him for him, not his height."
di2jvr,"NTA, He shouldn’t be lying to you or going behind your back. 

However don’t forget the old saying, there’s 2 kids of people in this world: people who watch porn, and liars."
di2prv,"NTA at the end of the day she may just drive anyway but you can’t stop someone from doing what they are gonna do. But it sounds like she shouldn’t have a license and it’s not you making that call, it is a professional. She needs to accept her limitations and she has options but she is gonna do what she is gonna do."
di2rep,"YTA

you wouldn't be going for Steve, you're going for your sister. He won't be hurt if you don't go, she will. If the two of you have a decent relationship, don't throw it away over this."
di2uj0,"NTA. If you want to partake in drugs, cool, but you can’t expect to be able to do it in or at someone else’s home."
di2wua,"NTA? Honestly you’ve saved up the money for this trip and made the plans. It sucks that you can’t be around for your brother’s homecoming, but as long as you let him know not to expect you and that you can call, I see no issues."
di2x1r,I'm going to go with NTA on this one. It was a holiday. You should be celebrating with your loved ones. Plus he should have asked you how you felt since you guys were celebrating the holiday together. He ended your plans without asking and left.
di2xxx,"NTA. Dropping in uninvited is rude in most cases, especially if she expects you to feed and house her and her son. You’re justified."
di32fa,"NTA!  She is being manipulative big time.  What if she got cancer...well what if YOU got cancer, what if I got cancer, it could happen to any of us, but after the age of 8 the ""what if"" game gets ridiculous.  She seriously sounds like a tween here!  

This is not the time for that talk, and it's not going to even be resolved in one talk.  You two should go to a family counselor and have that 3rd person to help lead the discussion and hopefully get things accomplished.

The loss of anyone you love is devastating, including animals.  I have lost several humans that I was extremely close with, who I loved dearly  (including my younger sister and also my best friend of 22 years) and had unbearable pain, but the loss of my dog was JUST as painful, if not more.  It hurts and you need time to mourn your loss.  Dont ever let anyone tell you that losing a beloved pet is less important than other losses."
di33n2,"ESH, you’re both acting like children."
di351z,NTA. It’s your life to live. They are being overbearing.

di3sse,"ESH, though i suspect you know this.

You admit your actions could have caused an accident. Sometimes, you just gotta lets the assholes go. Takes less time and effort vs having to manage traffic while cutting off someone, at least IMO."
di40s8,Very very very obvious NTA. Forget all about J just never ever talk or think about J again. He gone. Yeetus deletus him from your memory and never look back
di42aw,YTA. How can you ask for her opinion and then yell at her for giving one? She didn’t even seem to be harsh based of what you said she said. You can’t force somebody to like something by “ trying harder”. If I was her I’d want nothing to do with the book either after that.
di43gl,"NAH I think you should have told him to ask the people behind instead of just saying ""no"" tbh"
di43mz,"NAH. 

Scheduling conflicts happen, it's a reality of life. 

Whoever's you choose not to attend be sure to send them your apologies that you can't attend, a congratulations card (with money if it seems appropriate, but not required.), and maintain interest in things like wedding photos. 

If it's your sister's wedding that yiu choose to not attend, do keep in mind that it may look super bad to outsiders and there may be drama. Like, she already sounds a drama person but now you're backing out of being a bridesmaid *and* not attending her wedding in favour of attending a friend's? It sounds like you don't get on with her side anyway but this may make things much worse. 

Again, totally up to you NAH no matter which one you choose but you choice should be with proper consideration to the possible social consequences no matter how bullshit those may be."
di47x0,"You’re NTA. Not even a little. One thing I learned real quick while treating my mental health is that family accounts for like 80% of people’s mental health problems. They put a lot of unnecessary stress on us, and in fact are the ones who are selfish. It actually sounds like you did the smartest thing for you and your mental health. I hope you and your dude have a great holiday."

di4l1l,"YTA.

>Maybe it's because I(30yr M) grew up before flu shots were a thing

Just no. Flu vaccines have been around for more than 50 years. I'm a little bit older than you and have got one every year that I can remember.

And the vaccine is just as much for everyone else as it is for you.

Get the fucking shot."
di4nvr,ESH - I'm as surprised as you that she found this hurtful but I don't know why you started shouting at her either
di4tmh,"NAH. 

You wouldn't be an asshole, but please, please take my word for it (as a total stranger on the internet) that you should go to your friend's birthday. 

Colleges have parties literally every weekend. You will have so many more opportunities to go to college parties. 

Your friend sounds like she's having a tough time. I would be. And you're her best friend. She'd appreciate it if you came. 

Five years from now, looking back at this, do you think you'll regret not having gone to this particular block party? Of course not. Do you think you'll regret skipping your friend's birthday? If you think that's even reasonably likely, you should go."
di4wgi,"NTA. Maybe you should have spoken up and said, ""Hey, this isn't very fun if we don't actually have to try."" He shouldn't have called you stupid or childish, though. Who wants to drive 2.5 hours to have your boyfriend peek over the mazes? Takes all the challenge out of it. I'd be disappointed, too. But the real issue is you told him you felt a way, and he sorta invalidated it."
di520j,NTA but why go at all? Stay home and make an even bigger point.
di52vx,NTA - did he invite his friends to dinner at your place without even consulting you? He can't be offering people your car and food. That's not how it works.
di57tk,NTA for reporting him. I don’t see what Molly having a husband and kids has to do with anything though.
di5d0m,"Yeah, you cancelled therapy that you need, i'm sure that will teach them!

You're only hurting yourself, who cares about them or what they said? Get back in therapy if you need it."
di5dfj,NTA. they should’ve carried their own weight just like you were trying to. group projects suuuuck so I dont blame you for choosing to do it yourself
di5pac,"NTA She sounds very needy and that can be very draining.  And she’s being very dramatic saying she could have been in the hospital - sure you would have heard - her family would have told you!

di5y1u,"Eh this is tough. I’m asian but adopted but I have asian friends who grew up in this type of household. It’s tough. 

I’m gonna say that ESH. And I don’t mean that in like a “you’re terrible way.” You’re teenagers and this is a mistake that I can see a teenager making out of anger and frustration. I know talking to her rationally won’t make any difference to how she thinks but being passive aggressive is definitely not the right tactic either from the results you got. 

But your mom is being unreasonable even by some asian parent standards. It’s just cruel for her to kill your brothers self-esteem in this misguided effort to get him to do better. Chances are if you hasn’t intervened he would have alienated himself from her anyway. 

I think you and your brothers best tactic is for you both to sit down with her and tell her this kind of shaming won’t change behavior. Let her disagree and yell if she wants. And the next time she berates him or you, just nod and say “mm-hmm” and basically don’t give her anything to use as ammo.

di638s,"“I sometimes can be overly harsh by saying what I think about people before assessing if it’s worth saying.”

Is that an oblique way of saying you can be a bit cruel sometimes?

ESH.  

Your friend sucks because he attacked you first.  He probably knows you don’t like him.  If he had a problem with your behaviour he should have confronted you in private.  He was a dick about how he handled it.

Usually I believe you shouldn’t dish it out unless you can take it, but you crossed a line.  If you had said something about his annoying personality then that would be fair game.  He can’t help having a lazy eye, it’s totally out of his control.  There's nothing aesthetically wrong with having a lazy eye.  A lazy eye just looks unusual, unusual isn’t bad.  Thanks to people like you he probably has self-esteem issues about his eyes and you touched a nerve.

I would say your friend started it, but I don’t know whether you’ve been sending him passive aggressive signals that you don’t like him.  You were both assholes, but by crossing a line you almost absolved your friend of his assholery and claimed the crown."

You act like “the hard talk” is something every mom has with their daughter; it’s not. That was heartbreaking to read.

Your income is the household's income. Expenses are the household's expenses. This is why you're in a situation where your husband thinks that when he starts earning more money, you two don't need to sit down together to decide what to do with it. Financial disagreements are the #1 cause for divorce, so if you cannot get on the same page with a communal budget, communal expenditure/savings goals, and an agreement about yours work/life balance, you're headed for the cliffs."
di7puy,"NTA. It sounds like your sister isn’t so much asking if her fiancé can stay with your family so much as demanding it. This is especially concerning since it seems like your family has not even met this guy virtually. If she had provided a proper introduction and asked you to accommodate someone she is close to, I might be more inclined to see her side of things — though even so, things get tricky when the entire relationship is online.

Not even close.  If you went away for a long 4-day weekend and left your husband in control of everything that goes on in your household, could he handle it?

It will affect your health in ways I'm sure you've done research on, and will require you to make a number of changes in your habits and lifestyle which may very well affect your partner. If your partner is not okay with these changes and isn't comfortable with being with someone who is a surrogate, that's totally up to them. If you choose to go forward with this plan, then you should prepare for the consequences that your partner may not want to continue your relationship. 

Every relationship is allowed to have a deal breaker, and if this is it for your partner, then you may have to give up this dream for the time being or altogether. There are plenty of other ways you can go about benefiting other people that don't necessarily have as much of an impact on every aspect of your life - look into volunteering opportunities, donate blood, etc."

Edit for afterthought: in some cultures, it's customary for the paying party to refuse compensation, and for the compensating party to insist. After a bit of push and pull, whoever decides to give up first resolves the end of the paying conflict. Not sure if this applies here, but after asking enough times you can probably rest the ""debt"" safely with a clean conscience. Then again, if like a year later these people ask you for the money on the next vacation, that would be a true AH move on their part."

didyzs,Why not just say you miss hanging out - just the two of you and see what he says. You don’t need to bring up his girlfriend. He’ll likely just get defensive and you’ll really ruin it then.

And this is coming from a male who doesn’t know how to do this delicate stuff either. The way my wife and I do it is by splitting the duties: she washes and dries the clothes, I fold and put in bedrooms.

It’s all about specialisation."
dieg1a,"NAH. She can't help having a real phobia, and you shouldn't miss your friends wedding because of it. 

And seriously, she felt *vulnerable* after? This sounds attention seeking to me. She's an adult and she's back down on earth. She doesn't need a babysitter."
diej5s,"NTA

You really need to go to r/relationships for some advice. This is not a relationship advice sub.

But, for what it's worth, she is not a great friend if she feels lying about flunking a key class is a harmless prank. Then, when you push back, she calls you too sensitive. But, when you question the friendship compatibility issue, she starts crying and saying you've never treated her like a best friend. 

Is being a best friend involve lying to make a joke and calling you too sensitive because you didn't find it funny?"
diekui,"NAH (besides the toxic BF of course)
I was in your friend's place once. I know my friends were close to ditching me after two years of this shitty relationship. (He practically made me cut contact with them). I remember I would even get angry at my friend when she'd tell me to leave him, because ""she didn't understand"". Bullshit, I was in so deep I didn't see reason.
But they stayed, and helped me through it and I can't imagine my life without them. I'd probably still be in that toxic relationship.
On the other hand you do have the right to put yourself first, because it's your life not anyone else's, and you deserve to be happy, too... Depends how much you care for your friend I guess, and if those situations really make you miserable. It's really not a black and white kinda situation."
dielnd,"India's huge. They have hundreds of individual ethnicities, languages, and regional cuisines. Butter chicken might be popular outside of India, but there are far more dishes that locals would be familiar with. And that's assuming your friend of Indian background even grew up with Indian food in their youth. 

It'd be like asking someone from California, who's never been to Philadelphia (and never seen or tasted one) to explain a Philly cheese steak. They \*might\* be able to make a guess based on the mentioned components, but that doesn't begin to describe the process or the taste. 

So while it might not be outright and overtly racist, it's insensitive and rather naive to expect your friend to immediately know just because they are Indian. At the very least, it can be annoying to be the token (insert ethnicity here) to answer any and all questions about said ethnicity."

If you don’t want to hang out with Joe, you don’t have to. You can cite whatever reason you want to, or none at all; you’re not obligated to spend time with anyone.

However, let’s be realistic here: 4 months doing mostly nothing may seem like a long time, but when you just graduated highschool, it’s not. This will go on as long as his parents let it, which I suspect will not be much longer unless they’re fairly well off.

It’s his choice to do what he wants with his life. Maybe he doesn’t know what he wants to do yet. Maybe he’s depressed and doesn’t want to do anything at all. Maybe he needs to stop smoking weed. There’s a lot to speculate here. When reality sets in, it will hopefully change his mind. 

If you end the friendship now, don’t expect to be accepted back when he gets his shit together; doing nothing for 4 months and having your friends abandon you as a consequence does not showcase a great depth to the friendship.

I think he should do something with his life too, but it’s not your responsibility to make him think that. The responsibility is on the people he’s leeching off (his parents, I assume)."

dig7bj,"ESH. You need to learn to cook. It’s an essential life skill and it’s kinda a huge turnoff to have a partner that can’t even cook 1 dish. Seriously, make it your goal to learn to cook ONE dish. It can be something easy. Search the internet for “easy 30 minute meals” - while it won’t take you 30 minutes the first time, I think it’s inexcusable that you won’t even attempt to do something like that.   

Second, he sucks for how he is handling this, and how he is not helping in upkeeping the house at ALL. 

You guys need a serious conversation about chore splitting"
dig9dq,"YTA - Look at it from his point of view, you've just cut contact with no explanation whatsoever.

You couldn't have known and it's not really fair to make you do it again when it's your turn to sleep (especially since you already said you'd do it the next day) but wife is obviously struggling with juggling home responsibilities and baby. 

Just try to give her a hug when she's less cranky and tell her you'll take care of the household stuff  on your day off. Make a list of chores that fall to BOTH OF YOU and try to get as much of it done as possible. She'll appreciate the extra effort."

digfx7,"NTA, if she agreed to help you then she should of told her date she had something she had to do. She obviously doesn’t understand the seriousness of this video.

digh9f,"NTA, This kid sounds like a lazy spoiled brat. It would be good if he was to be disciplined. School can be hard yes. But I think you need to try your hardest. I never set a good example when I was in highschool. But if I could go back I would.  As the older sibling to my two sisters I constantly check up on the youngest to see if she is getting it done.

digrm1,"NAH. I hate these threads, it always comes down to the same thing. You are free to do as you like with your body. Your body, your choice. However there may be consequences to those choices. He is free to feel a certain way about your actions, and he's free to tell you about those feelings. There may be consequences to him opening those feelings and making those statements to you. If you guys can't communicate as a couple and get through this, or if one of you feels that this is worthy of relationship termination, that's how it's going to be. Neither of you can force the other one to remain in the relationship, and neither one of you can force the other to totally acquiesce to their requirements. 

These posts and situations suck because you're finding out where each other's Overton Window of a Relationship is, by stepping outside of it. You're fine with your breasts being exposed in this situation and context, he isn't. Some guys would be totally fine with this, other guys might not be okay with it. It's different for everyone. If he took his pants off to get in the hot tub and his penis was exposed, you might not be okay with that, but it's his body and his choice. You both have to ask yourselves ""has this situation proven that we are incompatible with each other?"""
digusa,"NAH.

I'm going to assume you are a dude, because I have a feeling this may have partially happened due to this factor...

You guys are in highschool. As someone less than four years separated from that part of my life, I'm going to say that most people in highschool are kinda shitheads. 

This is where gender (if you are a dude) comes in. You are not the asshole because based off of what you said this was simply a conversation. If you are a guy, chances are, your sex life is probably celebrated, or at least tolerated. A chick? Not so much. Even now, certain societal expectations will probably shame her for any sexual act, especially in highschool, because whether we want to admit it or not, that barrier is still very much in place.

Check up on her when she's cooled off."
diguvr,"NTA and of she’s up next for Christmas wouldn’t you just switch? She hosts thanksgiving, you host Christmas."
dih087,"NTA. Call it what you see it. Cut her out. She seem toxic if she doesn’t realize what she doing or if she does, it isn’t right to do this."
dih1ar,"NTA I cringed harder and harder with each word you wrote. You pretty much described what I would consider a complete nightmare—kids who aren't yours, a dog who won't do his business with all the distractions, being the neighborhood babysitter... ugh!"
dih2fy,"YTA. Trust me, I’ve been in almost the exact same situation as you. I lied to my parents, and it broke their heart. I couldn’t forgive myself for a long time. Believe me, they would much rather accept a bad grade than find out that their child is so scared of telling them the truth. 

Here’s my advice: don’t make the mistake that I did. Call up your parents. “Hey, mom, dad, I have something to tell you. I didn’t do well in this exam, because I didn’t put in as much effort as I should have, and I’m really sorry, but I didn’t want to lie to you about the grade. Our professor has told us that our final grade will be counted though, so I’m going to work extra hard and make you proud.”

They might be a little upset with your grade, but that will pass. It’s nothing compared to the heartbreak they will face if they find out that you lied. Even if they don’t find out, just don’t do it, OP. Telling them the truth will build the trust between you and your parents. I rarely reply to AITA posts, but this struck hard because I made this mistake over 5 years ago and it still haunts me. 

Trust your parents, OP. They want the very best for you. Good luck."
dih6dm,"YTA for the timing of 2am 20days after you've been sleeping with it there.

She is an adult; she forgot the charger, so she can figure out on her own how to deal with that by borrowing one or buying a replacement at a nearby store, or even (horror of horrors) be without her phone for the day since she does have access to other methods of contacting people if necessary. If she is willing to divorce you over this, you'd be better off letting her."

Mostly because you wrote the letter very well and asked for gifts that are not outrageous expensive.  This is a very tricky line, it is usually tacky to ask for specific gifts, but you did it well.  The only thing i might change is the bullets for listing the gifts.  It might look more casual if you wrote out the ideas in a paragraph form.
""We would love experiences like museum trips or events around town, new and unusual coffees or imported beer, fun new ingredients, local ciders, or just a donation to our charity.""
But that is the only change i would make."
dii7ya,"Dude, there’s no way you’re an asshole for this. In fact, you weren’t an asshole ENOUGH. You’ve got a tough road ahead of you if you don’t start putting your foot down more with dudes like this. You’re probably young, so I get it - I used to be overly nice, too. But that’ll only hurt you way worse in the long run, trust me.

Edit to add: Also, I’m NOT blaming you for his behavior! He is 100% disgusting and needs to be told how gross he is for thinking being pushy like this will work. But you need to look out for yourself, do not hang out with boys who make you uncomfortable from the very moment you meet them. And TELL him how shitty he is for putting you in such an awkward position, who knows how many other girls he’ll act like this towards. Or, even worse - if his behavior escalates. 

Confrontation can be your friend. Use it wisely."
diib1d,NTA. That sounds like a lot for a fifteen yo. You should be allowed to enjoy your teenage years.
diid9d,"NAH - It depends how you handle it. You can politely decline and just say you would like to spend your birthday with your friends/just doing something you would like to do.  As long as you assure Grandma that you'll see her at Thanksgiving, I'm sure the family will understand. Make sure to wish Grandma a happy birthday and ask for pictures so she doesn't think you're just blowing her off."

diilyi,"YTA it’s her choice whether or not she wants to blacken her lungs. If it upsets you that much, maybe you should distance yourself from that person.

Destroying the cigarettes wasn’t something you had the authority to do."
diim3l,"ESH, what communication was there to have? You understood what his passive agressive group chat comment implied, certainly. Clearly you acknowledge none of you want to clean up after yourselves, yet you are taking offense at the fact somebody has had enough of it. Why should this person need to deal with the consequences caused by everyone elses irresponsibility? The fact it took a week and a half to realize your own dishes were missing, and not in any cabinets is evidence enough that changes need to be made on your end. This is not just your fault, your other roommates as well. 

You really can't blame the one person out of five being frustrated that they are negatively impacted by those who just don't care."
diimxz,"NTA Is there a private place you can discuss this with your manager? If you chose to take that route, be clear with examples and don't get worked up.

Frankly, there's just one of those in most workplaces."
diinwy,"NTA. I don't think his mental illness has anything to do with it honestly. Up until you mentioned the theft I was thinking ""you can't just call the cops on someone being weird and vaguely creepy"" but if he stole stuff it's an appropriate response.

I know this isn't an advice sub but personally I don't like to involve police unless absolutely necessary and I don't think I would do so over cheap jewelry. I think it comes down to whether you would involve the police for this level of theft if anyone else had done it. If your neighbor had taken the rings, what would you do?"
diip1a,YTA. Don’t make plans in front of people if you’re not planning to invite them. It’s just rude and puts you in bad situations.
diiuop,NTA - This wasn't a library and people can't expect the world to be quiet because a noise might trigger their PTSD. You asked him if everything was okay and he could've said something then but he didn't.

That all being said, you're in class, this isn't even like they are asking you to use your spare time to do this. Just engage and do the exercise. The people who cop out of the sort of stuff just because they can I just demonstrating to everyone around them that they are taking a lackluster tack with the class. it doesn't sound like they are asking you to pray to a god you don't believe in, or pledge your allegiance to the evil empire.

I'm going to say NAH. This is a really shitty situation and you are justified in being angry and sad, but as you said, it was an accident. I do think it will be better for you not to rush to adopt a new dog though. Take some time to sort out your emotions and process the death of your friend. Also, I wouldn't be too hard on your mom for not being receptive to getting a new dog; your mom is likely traumatized by this as well, and it's possible that she just does not feel comfortable having another dog around so soon after what happened."

dim81p,"NTA. I think what he did was dodgy and unprofessional. But it's mostly creepy because of what we're scared it could turn into, not because of what it actually was. It sounds like it *could be* the start of a workplace harassment story, but in itself, it was just a guy awkwardly flirting and paying a girl a compliment, then agreeing to stop when she said it made her uncomfortable.

So, you want to be cautious and prepared. But I also don't think you should go into full-on defence mode over something that isn't actually that big a deal.

And honestly (get ready to downvote) being hit on, complimented and then left alone is *not* a big deal. For anyone. If it truly makes someone *that* uncomfortable, I think that's more to do with their fears, rather than a reasonable reaction to the actual situation. It's a problem when someone persists, sure.

I get that life happens and sometimes a dog isn’t feasible, but you chose to get a pet and should work around that, not get rid of it as soon as you can afford to live in a nicer area. 

That being said, you don’t seem to actually love this pet at all. As a result, it would probably be better off and have a happier life with someone who will love it.

I can't believe you're even considering this.  what a betrayal and hurtful thing to do to your husband.  You're allowing your father to mess with your relationship and are now trying to get your husband to feel good about it."
divjb1,NTA. Do not go down there period. Not your problem.
divk5l,"NTA (was INFO) - confused here... both share title, but he wants her to pay rent?  If she is co-owner, she can tell him to stuff it, methinks.

Edit after reply below: NTA - So he would be on the hook for paying half the mortgage.  In that case, he needs to pay his half if he wants to benefit years later from its eventual sale or renting outside the family.  What he is suggesting is that sister pays 100% along the way, but he gets half later.  I'd say if she pays him, that is buying him out and he doesn't get shit when they sell later.  He's not investing if he's not investing."
divkk5,"NTA but this doesn't sound like a good idea.

I feel like inviting people to comment on your private life is not the best idea, because other people can be assholes(and will potentially minimize his crappy behavior/make negative remarks about you). It's also going to engage your ex further in your life, when he flips his shit and continues to harass you because of this. Which also risks him escalating. 

I'm not saying be silent, I'm just disagreeing about your methods. Although I don't get the personal disclosure thing either.

Whatever you do, be safe."
divnhi,"> After a few months of it, they told me to just not talk to them if I was going to be sad/depressed. They only wanted to talk to me when I was normal or happy. 

I'm going to stop reading right here for a minute.

NTA

This person was not your friend. You have no reason to feel bad about this ""friendship"" ending, in fact, it's probably for the best. I'm still going to read the rest and may adjust this or add to it in a minute, but I wanted to get that out there right now. 

You're on meds for your depression, this is good. There is nothing wrong with this, and any implication of you not being ""normal"" because of it is a pile of horse shit so large you could fertilize every farm in the US with it for a decade. You. Are. Normal. 

Your ""friend"" is an asshole.

You should be happy they're out of your life.

Edit: Ok, finished it off. I stand by my judgement. It sucks that your friend is going through something similar, but its no excuse for how they treated you (good on you for not turning around and saying that shit back to them). If they had come back a week or two later and said something like, ""Hey man, sorry about last week, I was in a dark place an lashing out"" I might say otherwise. He didn't, and you tried to support him anyway. Then when you needed some alone time he tries to guilt trip you out of what you need? Fuck that.

He owes you an apology at the very least."
divohg,"Rest of the qualms you have with him are irrelevant to the post.

divra2,"I’m guna say NAH. Some people are tactile and some aren’t (although I do think touching your neck is a bit too much) but I think it reads like they’re a touchy group (like you said) and you aren’t. You’re maybe going to need to get better at saying stuff like ‘I’m not a hugger’ though? Your opinion isn’t wrong in the slightest, just clears the air from the get go."
divret,"YTA. I get that you didn’t know about the fee but I don’t think I’ve been to any appointment based service location that doesn’t have a fee for a no call no show. I also find it a bit repulsive that you would have been totally willing to get your bosses coverage so you wouldn’t have to pay a fee, but wasting your stylists time is not a concern of yours, apparently."

divxgz,"YTA. When you send someone money, you send them money. You should have done your due diligence on this person's character before you sent. Live and learn. You've got a bright future ahead of you, no doubt, this will be a valuable learning experience for you."
diw6i8,NTA.  Don't cater to her pity party.  And her trying to shame you into feeling bad about not more for her is bullshit.  You cant read her mind and if she wanted to be babied and coddled then she should go back to doctor or her parents house.  And her trying to say that your friendship is tarnished because of this is just a cop out and a manipulation tactic to make you feel shitty and to guilt you in to be submissive.  The fact that you actually feel bad is proof that it is working.  She sounds like a manipulative and controlling person.
diw75b,NTA she is being a unreasonable and should either be more faithful to her girlfriend or end the relationship.
diw9ol,"YTA. I’m a university professor. I’ve been on both sides of this situation and I think you acted unreasonably. First, your class does not begin at 10:57, it begins at 11. The 10 minute transition is a courtesy. And I have occasionally waited even a few minutes beyond, to allow the other professor to wrap up, and just to be a decent person.

Second, there’s the collegiality with your fellow faculty to think about. This is an issue to raise privately and after the fact, not by humiliating one of your colleagues in front of her students.  You made yourself look like an unreasonable bully. You power-played by commandeering another professor’s class. Lots of troublesome hierarchies exist between tenured, non-tenured, and adjunct faculty. Hopefully you didn’t make them worse.

Third, what would have been the harm in starting your lecture five (or even ten) minutes late? Would students have died if you’d had to speed up, or hurry through a few slides? No part of a lecture is worth more than modeling respectful behavior for your students. The point of a university is to defer to what’s best for STUDENTS. Deal with the discourteousness later, at an administrative level.

Fourth, I don’t see where you said to her “how much time do you need? Will you be done by 11:05?” Such a question would have been respectful and set the right tone.

Fifth, if her students were taking an exam (versus yours listening to a lecture) the stakes were much higher for her students. You force-ending their class even two minutes before completion might mean some students didn’t complete questions—thus endangering their grades.

Somehow I also don’t quite believe your account of the other faculty’s reaction. I could see a “do you mind if I have a few more minutes?” It was likely a plea for sympathy that was met with aggression. Regardless, you humiliated a professor in front of her students. All of this was both unprofessional and also undiplomatic.

I'm not saying the other professor going over time was justified. But it happens, and reasonable people use conversation to resolve these things, not power plays and bullying.

EDIT: Replies are saying ""but those are the rules—end at 10:50 to allow time to transition."" Yes, agreed, the late professor messed up and went over. Not by much. One minute, by class standards. They were maybe not an AH, but at least discourteous.

However, the entire point of this Reddit is to deal with those situations where an OP abided by the rules and yet still feels like a YTA. In this case, the label is warranted I think. The OP went into the situation with overly-righteous aggression, instead of understanding. There was another way to handle this, regardless of the late professor's actions."
diwczw,"Most definitely NTA. I have a feeling that I’m going to get down voted for this but I don’t care. I started smoking just like your girlfriend 17 years ago. I thought there is no way I could ever become addicted “I only smoke when X,Y and Z happens” sure enough that turned into a pack a day habit for 12 years! I’ve had countless friend who all said the same things as me and your girlfriend and we all turned into smokers. I’ve only met 1 person who could actually be a casual smoker. I quit smoking 5 years ago and it’s the best decision I’ve ever made. If I could go back in time and kick my own ass for having ever smoked that first cigarette I would."
diwe0w,"YTA

From what you described she is not making contact with them at all, just cyber checking on them. She is likely very happy with where she is now and is looking to see how much better she has it. But... you assume it is the opposite, that she would only look if she was longing for that... that assumption says more about you than her."

It's a curtosey to the father usually, but if it means enough to her that she wants you to talk to her brother first, why not do it? If she means enough to you that you want to marry her. It's definitely odd, but I don't think it makes her TA."
diwsit,"NTA and please don't tie yourself down in a mortgage with someone whose behavior is screaming, ""I'm not responsible, I make impulsive commitments and don't live up to them, I don't care about your feelings in decisions that affect both of us, and I think it's okay to call you insulting names when you have reasonable objections to my idiotic ideas!""

dix88m,"NTA, it was a drink and a conversation. Like you said you two aren't exclusive or in a relationship.  You didn't lead the ""drink buyer"" on and you didn't cheat."
dixamx,"YTA - If that's the sort of critique you gave them then you were being extremely nitpicky and looking for things to critique them on because you felt slighted.

*edit* basically it seems like you're trying to hide behind being ""thorough"" or being ""tough"" but in reality you were just looking to get back at them and finding every tiny little inconsequential thing to pick at them over."
dixbhz,"Your daughter didn’t cry for any reason other than being 3 years old and being told no. Father in law is being a bit excessive in this scenario where he expects you to explain incest, as you said.

Keep up the good work. You’re NTA."
dixcci,"NTA. Follow the rules or risk losing everything. He wasn't even trying to hide it.

EDIT: A lot of the comments are mentioning a curve on the SAT and how cheaters can manipulate this curve and degrade innocent students' scores, so the people on the phones might (MIGHT, not saying they always will) look up how to cheat or share answers. And you really can't be sure they're not cheating so it's best to ban the phones altogether and report any offenders to make sure innocent scores aren't at stake. And if you can't follow a simple rule for less than a day in a strict environment, lord help you in lecture halls and on finals. Plus what if you forget to turn off your alarm/ringer and your phone makes a noise, *and it's in your pocket?* No SAT score for you. In any case, you did nothing wrong OP and I uphold my judgement of NTA

Edit 2: Clarification"
dixh8b,"NAH - You don’t need to disclose that you’re bi. That isn’t a requirement of any friendship. I’ve had many female friends undress in front of me and it doesn’t become awkward because we’re both heterosexual and the opposite gender. They’re changing their clothes, not stripping for you. Some people are comfortable changing in front of others and then other people are not. This tends to be the case regardless of their gender."
dixika,This is a war you can’t win. Give them a small bit of candy and move on before you wake up to your place egged or TP’d.

dixlk9,"NAH

If my parents say some home soon when I'm with them for the holiday I know for sure they don't mean 2 hours and I'm 25. Instead of telling him you'd be home soon you should have communicated that you were expected to stay for dinner and they we're cooking food they expected you to eat but you'd be home right after and give an actual approximation of time.

Considering the was hazardous weather coming in your parents were doing the right thing and rightfully concerned."

YTA just for that. Hope she dumps you for her own sake."
diyqvk,"NTA. But, if you don’t tell her the truth, she will believe that you can’t help her in that moment because you are busy.

diz94l,NTA I always find it odd when they ask for tips at the counter.
dizaob,"Oh, nah. If she’s so homophobic that she had to be rude in response to a simple question asking how she felt about it, there’s no reason to continue being friends with her. As soon as she finds out you’re a lesbian she’s not going to respect you. Also, I personally don’t see prejudice as a “difference of opinion.” You don’t have to agree with everyone’s choices but damn, no need to be hateful about it. NTA."
dizb90,"NTA but you have to be careful about this. Anything you say to your ex may reach your boss and could get warped. This probably isn't the best approach. 

Your boss is being unprofessional by listening to your ex rather than going by her own experiences with you. This conversation may be the better approach. 

Of course, don't call them unprofessional.. Maybe ""I understand you are friends with ex and I respect that. The things you heard though, I don't know what she is talking about. I'd really appreciate it if you based your opinion of me on your own experience with me and not ex's. I'm serious about my commitment with the company.""

dizi5i,NTA. Honestly if my boyfriend hanged out with someone like this...well they wouldn't be my boyfriend anymore.
dizm08,"A gentle YTA. She might not have asked to be repaid, but maybe that's because you never offered. Maybe she thought, ""Wow, she *really* needs that money."" Well, maybe your mom does, too. Or, you know what, even if she doesn't, $500 is a lot to gift someone, and then find out they're going on a vacation. Guess they weren't hurting for money after all! (Edit: not saying that's true, just that's how someone could feel. Sorry!)

Cheap trips are still trips, and it's kind of a kick in the face to someone who just gave you a lot of money that you've got enough (now) to spend frivolously. And that you're choosing to do that instead of gift them back. Even a little."
dizmfn,"You're not the assholes, but I'll save you some time and tell you something you don't know: talking to the guardian will do nothing. If this is what John is like, the guardian already knows and has already decided they either don't care or don't feel they can do anything about it. NTA"
dizn70,NTA. You worked hard on it and it was a gift.
dizq1i,"YTA. But... well... so I'd be, too."
dizqin,"This whole scenario is so messed up that I don't really know where to start...

Leaning towards ESH. Not your place to tell them that their dad is dead (if they really don't already know that), but also shitty to let them continue to think you're their dad. Also, your SIL sounds truly messed up and probably needs to see a professional or something. What she's doing is not a healthy way to cope with grief. She's also going to mess up her kids by allowing them to think that their dad is alive and, in fact, you.

EDIT: changed ""normal"" to ""healthy"", as denial is technically a main pillar of the grief process."
dizr5j,"NTA - All you did was bring up factual information. Plus, she’s your friend, she deserves to know what kind of person she is. 

While I understand why Jack would be upset, it is entirely his fault for openly lying to her. It’s not like you told her “Jack is an asshole and you shouldn’t date him,” without any explanation. Again; if telling someone objective personality traits/lies from another person turns them off, then that is entirely on them."
dizrio,"NTA, if it was me (I’m an asshole) I’d not let boyfriend use car to visit his parents and if they want him to go visit them, they can pay the same amount it is for an Uber to get there, to you NOT THEIR SON."

Has he done this before? Either joked about ending his own life or joked about how you should prove your love to him? His behavior seems very odd and unhealthy."
dizwq7,NTA- and you need to get out of that relationship ship fast. Being sick is not an excuse to treat a loved one so poorly.
dizxv9,"If she was being logical she would realize that you were honest with her, and that she is mad at you for being honest. That's a bit self-defeating of her.

dizylx,"NAH, I used to work for one of those departments and people will search for everyone and thier mother. She was probably looking up the last name (they dont require a first name to search) and it gave a list of everyone who has unclaimed property with that last name. If your husband and his brother have the same last name she probably just noticed it.  They literally would publish the list of names in news papers so it is public info."
dizyt5,"YTA for not taking the time to seriously consider what it meant to be in a relationship with someone with kids. You waited until she was invested, and comfortable letting you meet the kids, and THEN you decided it wasn't working for you? Now the kids have met you, and you think NOW is the time to end it? Thats exactly the situation she wanted to avoid by waiting...

dj0egb,"NTA. You can't get to the front of the line and say you need a minute, that's unreasonable.

dj0fu1,Info: why was your mom with you during a professional meeting?
dj0fzz,"NTA: he is the problem, not you.

It’s unfortunate that you didn’t feel able to speak up sooner. Hopefully this shows that you can if anything comes up in the future. The supervisor scolding you for not explaining sooner is likely them attempting to (perhaps poorly) convey that they care about what you have to say and want to be better able to take care of you."
dj0iwl,"YTA - Not for being happy they’re there but for the “I told you so” to your daughter in law.   It seems to me that them refusing to take your money to buy their house was kind of a sign they didn’t want it to look like they moved because of you.   That being said, your son should have told you years ago to stop hounding his wife about moving.  And if he did, and you didn’t listen, you’re double the asshole here."

No apologies, they never actually amend the statement, and they never try harder cause they don't care. THAT is an asshole move, at least you're trying."

dj1r0x,"YTA- it’s wayyy too early for you to start critiquing his parenting. Your familiarity with one 5-year old doesn’t make you a parenting expert. A lot of what you describe is very much in the normal range for a 5 year old. She’s still testing boundaries, and it’s ok for them to still be dependent on their parents. They should be working towards becoming independent, but most 5 year olds just aren’t there yet."
dj1yen,"Of course you're NTA. Even if they weren't acting horrendously (which they are), it is not your responsibility to provide two grown adults (one whom you helped land a high paying job!) with a house and cell phones."
dj20x8,NTA massively. Your gf expects a cat that was abandoned in a field not to have some sort of emotional trauma and cry? Jeez. The fact that she is referring to the cat as “it” and “the thing” should tell you enough.
dj24h5,"NAH but you aren't going to achieve your goal if you do it this way. People are not going to understand what you mean by it and are either going to think you're being passive-aggressive or they won't take the sign seriously at all since it's sometimes used for jokes.

I would take each of your coworkers aside and explain what you explained here, that you have a problem with being touched (you don't need to say that you're autistic, just that being touched is an issue for you) and that you need them to do what your manager does - get in your line of sight and wave to get your attention. Being specific and direct is the way to get what you want."
dj280i,"NAH. If he’s a chef then he probably knows what he’s doing, and his “overbearing” presence only seems that way to you because you don’t work in the type of environments he does. If him in the kitchen makes you feel that way then you just have to tell him that, and if he doesn’t accept it then that’s his problem."
dj2chd,NTA why would your wife want to be a dick to her nephew?
dj2egg,"NTA, you were open and honest. I’d rather have that from a friend than a wishy-washy “yes” and then no-show. 

Truth is, we’ve all gotten scared of being truthful like this because it hurts everybody’s feelings. Thing no one seems to get is that these bullshit plans that never seem to work out are just dishonest, chicken-shit ways to step away from a relationship. I’d much rather have a friend say something like you said. Yeah, it may come across a little harsh, but it’s fucking honest! I’ll take that any day!"
dj2jud,"I mean. Refrain from making jokes at those times... but given that you misunderstood and didn’t intentionally mean for anything, I wouldn’t really call you an Asshole, more a circumstantial idiot."
dj2kac,"Old while it's easier to blame Luke I feel that the bigger child in this in your boyfriend.
He should have knows when to stop and get home instead of expecting someone else to babysit him.

8 years plus you need to evaluate your relation"
dj2nmw,NTA- His behavior is a red flag imo.
dj2wa7,"NAH - You're an idiot for explaining it that way, but not an asshole.

What I learned when my grandmother had  dementia is that it's often not about ""what's important"" but how the memory was made and how long it's been there. She forgot her kids names before she forgot her siblings. Towards the end, she couldn't recognize anyone but could sing all the words from one her favorite songs as a teenager. 

Your wife shouldn't begrudge wearing a nametag. It's not a personal insult. Sadly, you'll probably be wearing a nametag pretty soon too. Maybe you should just start wearing one now to be on an even playing field with your wife."
dj2wrz,YTA I know you want to be thoughtful but this is an instance where you should stay out of it unless he expressivly asks for that. It could completely destroy him
dj2z19,"NTA - You should honestry shut both those people down, you sound like a really nice person and two people like thst dont deserve such a friendship from you and are not worth your time"
dj2zvr,NAH it was a misunderstanding due to a lack of communication.  Maybe you can offer to pay 1/2 of the price if she saves up the other half.   Or some other compromise.
dj306w,NTA - don’t  know what to say really. They are doing something wrong. You have all the right to correct them
dj37uu,"Option 3

Go with what your aunt would have wanted and ask your grandmother for advice. If she was invited it's likely she would have told your mother anyway and you could have stayed out of this. 

Why did your mother have to bring her new partner and child though? That seems a bit tactless. Or did they have a relationship with your aunt?"
dj3a2b,"The only reason you really gave for not liking her was her views. You mentioned her calling him, but girlfriends will actually call their boyfriends; that's normal."

Neighbour is over-stepping and asking you to."
dj3ejh,"NAH. Unless they did something to break it, it’s not necessarily their fault the the microwave broke. Maybe consider messaging them saying the new microwave could be considered a form of rent payment or something. Yes it broke on their watch and it seems kind of cheap for them to not just offer to get a new one since you are letting them stay at your place, but if you go about it the right way I think you could avoid either of you being considered an asshole."

This holds no weight with me. If they don't want to go, there's no reason you should feel guilty for taking your mum, who does.

However, if you don't want her there, that's your call. I'd personally offer the money back to her, explain that I'd rather not have someone with me and my new husband on our honeymoon immediately following the wedding and you're sorry she's not invited. I'm sure she'd probably say to keep the money, but you'd be an asshole not to offer it back, given that she clearly wants to come along.

YTA if you don't at least offer the cash back, imo."
dj4646,"NTA. The fact that she said ""don't tell your parents"" rings immediate alarm bells with me. Do not speak to her again."
dj4992,"I'm confused. You say you're looking for a job but it's hard because you have the baby, but instead of saying you have the baby too often, you say you need more money. You had the perfect opportunity to say you wanted to have the baby less so that you could focus on the job hunt.

ESH. You handled it wrong, your mother expects too much."
dj49h2,She doesn't sound perfect but YTA here. People can't live their own lives according to yours.
dj4bm4,"One of my corporals was (probably still is) Mormon. Even though he was stationed away from home, his church still ""expected"" his tithes. He had his pay set up so 10% went to his church back home.

Except, he set the payments up when he was a Lance Corporal. (E-3 in the Marine Corps)

One day back home, his mom was chatting with friends and mentioned that he had been promoted to Corporal (E-4).

The church figured out when he got promoted, calculated the difference in pay, and sent him a bill for the 10 months back pay he ""owed"" them.

Be religious if you want. Or just be spiritual. Just don't be an ass.

NTA   Your family is taking advantage of you."
dj4d26,"NTA there comes a point where you can't be charitable anymore. I'm sure all your other employees were aware of her lack of care for her job and it will get to a point where they ask themselves ""why can she get away with this and I can't?""

dj4hue,"NAH if you ask. Just don't force it if it's not something he feels comfortable doing. Your grandfather might not want to spend his last days going over the past, or it might be physically difficult for him to talk a lot.

My dad is currently in the same position as your grandfather, and some people are expecting a lot of fairly intense ""quality time"" with him when what he wants most is for everything to just feel normal. Sometimes he wants to talk, but sometimes he just wants to watch TV or listen to music or read the paper."

dj4o7y,"NTA, you got a shitty friend there bud."
dj4ox0,"Meh. Maybe? But I'd do it anyway. I'd contact the acquaintance, tell them something came up and you can't make it, and offer to give them your ticket.

dj4oxt,"YTA

“It seems like this turned into a situation where my friend thinks he can poke fun at his fellow group members and the whole dynamics but because I did it that was over the line.”

Yes. That’s exactly what happened. That’s how life works. People can criticize their own work all they want, but you need to support your friends and keep your opinions to yourself, at least in public. Your friend clearly worked hard, so you can tell him how good he did without knocking everyone else."
dj4pny,"NTA - funerals are for the living so don't go if it will distress you. You don't have to go look in the coffin, by the way. You can usually come from the outer aisle, hug your aunt and family, then go to the back near some less emotional people."

dj51nr,"NTA. What a lovely thing you've done, and put so much effort into. If he's not coming over ASAP with a handmade thank you card I don't think he ever will."
dj52tc,"YTA. I know this isn't specifically a restaurant style; but where I worked people would try to swoop in and take tables before we were able to clear them off to ""claim"" them. Every single time I had to say ""Sorry there are other people waiting who got here first, you need to get in line."" and they would make a fit. The other woman was waiting first and asked the guy for the table. It isn't like she was in a store or something, she was right there waiting. She probably wanted to give him personal space as he was leaving instead of just jumping onto the table."
dj52z2,"YTA. He’s been completely open about his exes with you, but you haven’t told him anything. If I was hanging around with one of my SO’s exes (as it sounds he is) I would want to know especially if the history was bad enough that I would want to break that friendship.

ETA: Not telling him does make it seem like you have issues trusting him. That’s something you need to work out."
dj5fb0,NTA. It's not hypocritical. And it is weird to pressure people into buying a particular costume.
dj5gda,NTA. Your parents are both assholes. It sounds like your mental health might improve significantly if you cut your father off as well.
dj5iqx,"NTA. We do things for the unreasonable old people in our lives. Basically, your in-laws want their grandkids to be Jewish and nobody in the community will consider them such if you don't convert. Stupid rules, but if they really believe in them and it's no skin off your ass to do it, who cares? Your friend needs to mind his business.

The unicorn thing was kinda rude. Not asshole level rude though."
dj5kao,"YTA - you’re not entitled to all of your SO’s free time. He has other relationships to maintain even if you don’t see their value. 

I understand missing your SO and wishing you had more time together. But don’t try to poison the family well to accomplish this. You’re just going to have to find a way to come to terms with this or the relationship isn’t a match."
dj5myf,"I would give her the option to pay in that case, if she doesn’t want to she can make that choice. It seems like since you’re both feeling some sort of guilt, maybe you both feel responsible. Would paying half on both ends work?"
dj5x6t,"Seems unpopular but I’m gonna say NTA.

The anti-vaxx movement has done so much damage. It’s made society more ableist, spread false science, and brought back epidemics. I think that as a doctor, putting those (most likely totally unfounded, correlation does not equal causation) claims forward to the mother of a newborn is at best unwise and at worst despicable. I get the vibe that he’s totally manipulative—the casual, “Oh, about time for him to get vaccinated, huh?” only cements my view. He knows what he’s doing.

I’m not sure what you would report him for, but find a new vet. I wouldn’t trust an anti-vaxx doctor either."
dj60pf,"NTA.  This is seriously someone's job?  To drive a car around blasting ads at people?  And this somehow helps whoever is advertising?

dj6f5n,"YWBTA - you want to go scorched earth on your own child because you're not great friends?  You want to deprive brothers of their relationship because you argue over trivial things?

You’re not Oceans Eleven, plotting your next heist based on the group’s favourite bank. 

You’re 4 friends who haven’t hung out in a while, and you have opted to hang out with one person as they are more readily available. 

Kinda assholey to say you won’t be asking the others anymore, just because you don’t know they circumstances so you’re making it dramatic and personal when you don’t need to. You just need to get used to being out of school now and people having different schedules. That’s quite possibly the real reason, as opposed to actual rudeness or dislike/ghosting. 

What I typically do, in these circumstances, is announce in the group chat, when not all reply or only one person is available that “aw too bad guys, we’ll try and get the lot of us next time. V, if you’re still up for it we can still do Friday?”

Then V says sure, and you move to private. 


What you did wasn’t specifically shady, it’s just that it could later on be interpreted as so and cause drama. My way keeps its open and on the other two to step up if they actually want to play."
dj6w3j,NTA for how you treated him. But potentially consider that taking 8+ spots on a busy day might not be the most polite thing to do either.
dj6w87,"NTA - you are not the parent and do not need to step into any shoes.

dj6xjs,NTA. It's your name and your life. No different than someone changing their surname when they get married. Your dad will get over it!
dj6zsm,NTA. I would do it. Doctors are expensive and to treat you like you’re an annoyance is very unprofessional.
dj71gj,"YTA / YWBTA if you did this. Initial stage or not it still is his idea. You've discussed this with Matt, I think you should bring this up with Joe. As in, maybe invite them both for coffee, and you and Matt can discuss with Joe how he/you both think this could move a lot faster. Give a definitive timeline, have your answers ready, have a plan; don't just leave it up in the air. Phrase it as a suggestion on what Joe could do, make sure he knows he's still in charge but that you two could help him propel this along. But taking his idea and leaving is pretty asshole-ish."

dj79er,"NTA. You probably wouldn't get her fired, they'd just address the problem. They're not going to fire a teacher on the report of one student.

dj7i7l,"You still have the footage of her ""not consenting to this"" right? Send it in a mass email to all your family, that should shut her up. NTA"
dj7iik,NTA. Bringing up how you can’t steer the cart was unnecessary and immature.

dj7ooa,"NAH. Your ex- has every right to be upset. You have every right to take the trip.

Good for you that you are trying to be cordial and remain friends with your ex-, but I will let you in on a little secret: your friendship will eventually fade and your ex- will be a remnant memory of an older time. At that point, won't you want the memory of taking the trip with your friend?"
dj7r40,NTA. You don’t need to potentially endanger yourself to help a stranger.
dj7ycb,NTA - Optional is optional.
dj7z7d,"NTA. It's really not your responsibility to watch your friends son. And the son is 28yo, not some 16yo kid. If he wanted off the drugs, he'd be a responsible adult and seek help himself. Your buddy is just wasting his time."

dj8k7h,"NTA I work in senior/adult care. The amount of neglect or abuse that would have had to occur in order for this to dealt with in criminal court, and for her to actually serve years, is absolutely terrifying and heartbreaking.  She absolutely should not be left alone with someone vulnerable."

And ask for his permission to propose, when she hates him? And then try to make her see her dad for your own gain - so your plan can work out?

2. If the tree hangs over sidewalk or street you might be able to get public works to write a citation to get the homeowner to handle it. In my city if you own property with a sidewalk you are responsible for making sure the sidewalk is clear.

3. Usually my city cuts trees back from power lines if it’s necessary. Sometimes it’s not but you could potentially call about it.

dj9lxz,"ESH. You will 100% be the asshole if you let her and that dog move in. Think about it. By letting Jo and that dog move in, you are giving Charlie the message that she doesn’t deserve to be safe in her own home. That is not fair to her. You have no way of knowing if obedience classes will work. They might or they might not. 

Especially because obedience classes often require a lot of time and effort on the part of the owner to make them work. Jo straight up doesn’t care and will not reinforce anything, so it’s unlikely the classes will make a difference. She doesn’t even want or care enough to go, so what makes you think they’ll help? They’re not magic!

It would be one thing if Charlie were scared of dogs, by this dog has growled at and acted aggressively towards her. That is absolutely an accident waiting to happen. What will you do if the dog bites Charlie? Because it sounds like that could easily happen. 

If Jo wants to move in, let her use that ridiculous amount of money to put her dog in a kennel for however many weeks she stays with you. Or else she can find somewhere else to stay. You should be prioritizing Charlie here."

djb3ks,YTA. Sorry but If you are cool with exploring and allowing him to explore why does the sex of the other party matter. Seems kinda homophobic.
djb4bm,NTA - simply say you wish them all the best but you have another commitment and won't make it.   They are the assholes for not verifying your name spelling and getting your invitation to you more directly (which I feel they would have done had your presence been important to them).
djb5wf,"NAH- Sounds like y’all have been spending enough time together. Everyone needs alone time sometimes. However, she has the right to be sad. Being sad isn’t an asshole move."
djba80,"NTA. You have a family to take care of and taking care of a mentally ill person is a burden in itself. Your mom needs professional help and to take her meds. If she won’t do it, you can’t make her either. That’s unfortunately the reality of the situation. I get that she’s your mom, but there has to be a time where enough is enough."
djbfw7,"NTA - It was an honest mistake, and they are being massive babies if they report you."
djbh2r,"YTA.  Maybe you should stop asking him for 100% honesty if you don't want to hear it.  He even does lie at first based on what you've said (ie ""you're beautiful""  ""what do you really think?"").  Sounds like a great guy.  He's polite but honest.  The problem is with everyone else expecting him to adhere to nonsensical social convention.

djbmf8,"This feels like one of those situations where *technically* you're not TA, because saving names is a weird thing especially where pets are involved, but people are going to *think* you're TA because babies outrank dogs, even though dogs are objectively better in every way (/s. kinda.)

You've been asked to do a pretty simple thing, you wouldn't be the worst person in the world if you didn't do it, but a different nickname like Mills or Lilli or something would go a long way in keeping the peace. NAH."
djbnlw,"NAH - I hate that noise too but it's not the kid's fault really, and the mum is probably just as sick of it as you are. You can't really say anything to her because a) she cares and she can't stop it - like maybe the kid is autistic or something - or b) she doesn't care and you're not going to make her.

No, he just can't afford to live with his head in the clouds. What's happening is happening to him, not you. He can't wait till the last minute to put plans in place if the worst happens. Yeah, you'll be effected by it, however it's not the same.

You are being selfish, there's time to fix that though."
djcmj2,You would be an asshole but sometimes you need to be
djcsba,"YTA - She revealed an extremely embarrassing thing to you and as an uneducated man about this topic you probably judged her for something she didn't even choose. You don't have to date her, but I'm sure your reaction could have been nicer. From someone who contracted herpes years ago from someone who didn't disclose his status to me, you don't realize how hard it is to tell someone you are interested in without them rejecting you. I've been rejected many times by men and I've had men accept it. Either way, there's a mature way to handle it and you seem to not have done that. And for the record, I've dated many men who didn't have herpes and I never gave it to them. With proper communication and taking anti-virals, the chance you can contract it is very low. I advise you to educate yourself on this topic."

You are a 30 year adult. Invite whoever the hell you want to your special day that can act like a loving family and adult. 

If your mother cannot, then don't invite them. If you do, tell her that you don't want negativity during your graduation and if she can't respect that you won't be able to have her be part of future events in your life."
djd80s,"Tbh you don’t need a new job, you need a new man. He’s not pulled his weight once in the 6 years you’ve been together, and whatever way you spin it and however much you defend him, financial responsibility is something you CANNOT get wrong in adult relationships.

cheers to poppop and daddy-o. cancer sucks."
djdf96,"NTA, this seems like a reasonable solution that still allows people to miss class for religious reasons"
djdfks,"NTA. The moment that Char says that the boyfriend could buy the ticket off her and then she gives it away to someone else is the moment that she becomes the asshole. 

Prior to this, it is an N A H scenario: Char and Laura want a girl’s night and you want your boyfriend there. If Char were to say, “No, your boyfriend can’t have the ticket because I want it to be a girls’ night.” It still would have been N A H. However, she said “Yes” to pretend to accommodate you, hoping that you would not be able to buy a ticket when she got rid of hers, effectively making it impossible for your boyfriend to attend because of the circumstances. You would then let it go as water under the bridge and ignore the skullduggery.

Thankfully, that’s not what happened and you laid bare her asinine behavior. While a friendship with Laura might be salvageable, I could not be a friend with someone like Char who was trying to manipulate and deceive me so brazenly."
djdjfl,"NAH - It sucks, but you're a minor and she has a responsibility to keep you safe, there's a lot of dangerous people on the internet."
djdmik,I’m apparently the oddball saying YTA. If you’re not going on the trip then you have no say in when it happens. You can easily schedule the party for when they’re back. That’s certainly a lot easier than planning a trip.
djdnea,"NTA, you're trying to help your friend, and if you are offering to drive, you can put stipulations on that. However I don't know if this would be the best approach. He has shown he is already willing to drink and drive, so if you make the cost of having a DD too high, he may just go back to drinking and driving, which helps nobody. You should also have a plan for if he agrees to these stipulations, but winds up drinking too much anyway. Because again, having him drive home himself helps nobody."

djdoxd,"NTA, but borderline ESH.

The dude sounds like an absolute creep, but trying to break his phone is definitely an asshole move. Regardless, you're still in high school, so you have options. Breaking contact is a must, but I don't know if that'll stop the pictures. Asking him to stop clearly isn't enough, so try to be a little more mature about it and talk to your professor."

In life sometimes we try things that aren't right but we don't know it yet. It was a teaching moment. Sounds like you were being a smart ass.

Not to mention the teacher surely tried it and said something like nope that doesn't work, let's try something else. Unless you interrupted before they had a chance to."
djdxtn,"NTA. She is an asshole not for the surgery, but for not owning it and flat-out lying about it. Nothing wrong with getting surgery.

Some have suggested just quitting. I'm behind that. If you don't stand for yourself, no one will.

If you're too stubborn/scared/complacent to quit, ask for feedback. If they give you good feedback, then you have a reason to ask for more money. If they give you poor feedback, they're not going to give you more money so just quit.

Most companies do a 90 day review, so it might be more appropriate to ask for a raise then. Ask for feedback asap though.

djexw0,"NTA. Your husband was the one who received the invitation so it's his fault he just ignored it instead of, like, opening his fool mouth one whole time to you or his own blood family to ask about the wedding. Wtf. Perhaps he should be reminded that he is in fact responsible for handling social communications he receives, and they don't just magically re-transmit to the nearest vagina in the house. Sheesh

I also give you a pass for saying it was tacky, because a shitty facebook invite to half a couple only two weeks ahead is basically a nonvitation."
djeyr3,"NTA wtf, you are providing a loving environment for your daughter and he wants to change that?

djf7n5,"NTA — buy some photos for yourself. And have a serious talk with your boyfriend about how he’s being completely unreasonable and selfish. If he doesn’t want a picture of himself posted that’s reasonable, it’s not reasonable for him to try and control your image."
djf81t,"NTA - You stood up for yourself, there’s nothing wrong with that. If given the choice, most people would prefer to stay with their friends in a hotel room versus people they hardly know. It’s not like it “just worked out that way,” someone legitimately stole your spot."
djf87c,"Even if your current supervisor knows your looking and is supportive of it (which is all odd to me, but that’s irrelevant), YWBTA if you didn’t give notice. Unless you’re ok with burning this bridge....give 2 weeks notice. You’re working in a professional field, you need to act like it. 2 weeks is standard notice for leaving your job. Also, think of how this could look to your new employer when you tell them you can start today, but you’re still actively employed with another company, and not giving them notice. If you’re ok with doing this to your current employer, what would make them think that you don’t have the potential to do it to them? IJS."

If she gets there and walks directly back that's a 3 mile walk with a baby and dog. A 3 miles walk with just a dog would probably take a solid hour and cost you more than $20 in many high COL areas.

You don’t have to force yourself to have a relationship with anyone that you don’t want to."
djgmlx,"NTA. I would absolutely want to know why a long term relationship ended. It’s not like anyone is being hurt more then they already are by you telling the ex why your cousin broke up with her. The ex wasn’t fishing for info, so she’s not using you to get back at him, I think letting her know why it ended will help her heal and move on, there is absolutely nothing assholish about that."
djgn9z,"ESH. Hear me out. You have a lot of animosity towards her cat by even going so far as to call it, ""it"". That's her pet, many consider pets to be family. If she can see how much contention and resentment you have for the cat, I can see her choosing her cat over you because she's not getting rid of her pet but she can end this relationship. I'm not saying that's the right thing to do here. I also don't think her actions are right either. She should be able to compromise on the bed thing. But you know this cat means the world to her.

As a cat owner, when they bestow their attention on you, you don't just take it for granted. My husband would gladly shove me away if it meant one of our cats in particular is laying on him because that one doesn't do it very often if at all.  This is just in reference to the couch situation you mentioned. Personally I don't disturb them and I just sit next to them on the other side of the couch. This cat never does this with me and I don't try and ruin it for him. It's the little things that make him happy.

Have you sat down and explained all these feelings in a calm and non-resentful way? I think you need to think long and hard about if this is going to work communication wise for your relationship. Honestly if I wasn't married and a boyfriend was being a dick to one of my cats, that's not my man anymore. I know it's the same for my husband. I don't think you guys should break up by any means but I do think you need to have a real heart to heart about this. Or maybe she should be coming to your home for sleepovers to balance out how much alone time you guys get. That gives you more time to figure out the cat situation."
djgpmc,"YTA, for a few reasons:

~~1) Keeping a dog kenneled all day is incredibly cruel, especially to a 1 year old collie!~~

~~2) spay your pets for fucks sake~~

3) your neighbors just had a baby and your dog, by your own admission, barks a lot because you have her locked up. 

Find someone to sit your dogs or take them to a doggy daycare or something. You’re making your pets your neighbors problem and that’s asshole behavior.

djgtiv,"NTA - This sounds like your being pushed into a burnout. Speaking from gone through other types of burnouts this isn’t anything anyone wants. I’m not sure about your age but maybe it’s time to tell the parents that all their behavior is doing is making you not want to dance. If they want you to stay in it then they need to step back and maybe you should take a short break (not long just to get out of the funk) because burnouts are nasty and can take months to bounce back from. 

Also if your Dads been around the block as much as it sounds he should be familiar with the concept of muscle memory. You missing practice or one competition will not undo years of training. Missing several because of a burnout could though. If you want to keep going address this now before it’s too late. 

Also I would be careful about over-stretching past the limit you know you can. You can pull muscles do that. Then you would be out even longer. Something you would think your parents would know anyway..."

djhxyl,"NTA. It is not unreasonable to stay in a hotel when visiting family, especially considering she doesn’t even have a spare bedroom and you are putting her out (literally).  I would just remain insistent with her that you will be coming for Christmas but prefer the hotel room and so will be doing that. She will come around eventually - I’m sure when push comes to shove she’d rather see you guys than be alone at Christmas. She’ll probably be a pain about it but just dig up all your patience and trudge forward because you’re right, your hubby will likely regret if he doesn’t get the quality time in with his aging mom."
djhygf,"NTA. Seriously - this woman sounds like she's got a screw loose. No way would I let a random stranger feed my dogs ANYTHING. There are crazy people out there who get their jollies by poisoning people's pets. 

While this woman might seem harmless, she is affecting your dogs' health and creating problems in the dog park. Most dog parks specify NO food, no children under a certain age etc. - so she's probably already in breach of the park rules. 

You need to talk to the supervisor about getting this woman banned from the park. It sounds harsh - and she might love the interactions with the dogs - but her behaviour is unsettling (ignoring direct requests etc.) and clearly causing problems."
djhz6s,"NTA why do people always want to try and explain/justify their sex work. You do it, that's it. I feel like trying to explain it kind of further gives the industry a negative connotation"

djjew7,"Definitely NTA.

It's extremely inappropriate to say those jokes at work, especially when you told him NOT to and you don't feel comfortable with him doing so. 

But since you are worried about your mutual friends within the workplace, I would recommend properly talking to him 1-on-1, saying that if he continues to make inappropriate comments, that you'll have to report it to the HR. It seems to take everything as a joke so I wonder how he'll respond in a more serious situation. If he STILL continues to do so, just report him. It seems that other coworkers seem to think it's inappropriate from your explanation."
djjfgu,"YTA, you should have gotten up and left the theatre. It doesn't matter if it took long to reply, people are there to enjoy what's on stage not the light from your phone. People paid money for that and were right to be angry."
djjnw9,"YTA Oh my god, dude.

First of all, you've always planned a bunch of stuff for each other's birthdays so you not doing anything is obviously a slap in the face. Second, she just had a HUGE mental health crisis that forced her to *drop out of school* and you didn't think she might need her partner to show her a little special attention? Third, you didn't think of *something* more personal than an instagram post?? I mean, Jesus.

Yeah, because she had a breakdown that has shaken up her entire life. You couldn't set aside your studies for one day to make her feel special?"
djjqlw,"YTA

If she's lived with him for three years and had him as primary caretaker, he's her owner/home now.  Plus, if your parents already ""kicked"" Millie out once due to shedding and odor, what makes you think that they'd be okay with you trying to move her back in to the house just because you're there now?

It sucks, losing a pet is hard, but it's not fair to the dog to do this back-and-forth routine every time your parents get sick of her fur/shedding.   Let her stay with your ex where she is comfortable and loved - and get a new dog (if your parents/landlord okay it) that you can learn to love just as much."
djjrqo,NTA. Stick to the facts when they ask you though.

I complain and speak to a manager and they told me that they didn’t have the sauce that goes on it so therefore it makes it unavailable, that I can totally understand. I tell her I don’t order it with the sauce anyways and if they would just let me order it or tell me they didn’t have the sauce to begin with this could’ve all been avoided. She gives me my sandwich and all is good. Just for shits and gigs 10 minutes later I order it from the app, sauce and all and guess what, they had it. I think a lot of their workers are uninformed about things and it’s incredibly frustrating.

djkfgp,"ESH. The cashier literally is doing her job - if you’re lucky enough to look under 25 to her (as is the government policy) then she must ask for ID. You questioning it, however lighthearted, is something she hears day in day out from people she’s asked for ID and it gets old very quickly, and you also made an assumption as to why she ID’d you and confronted her on your assumption. That being said, her tone and actions were definitely unprofessional."
djkk5u,"NTA as you're already going beyond your job description to help people. Complaing about it is very ungrateful on their behalf. They don't seem to appreciate what you do when you help them, so I think you're right about focusing on your own job instead. These people don't sound easy to please, so you do you and let them worry about their own jobs."
djklvg,NAH. You're 13. Your parents are allowed to parent you for a few years yet.
djkm1o,"NTA unless you intended for it to cause a shitstorm.

Have your wife tell her family... *'Oh, he's always been like this. Just let it roll over your head and let it go*.  Seems that should placate everyone."
djkrgw,"NTA, it's just business."
djkrvs,"Yta holy crap.  Trust issues much?  YOU TOLD HER to spend the night then you got all high and mighty over males being there, then you pulled a manipulator move and told her some bullshit about her choosing this night of all nights to do this and if you did it then hell would break loose? You are a manipulator.  You don't deserve her."
djksg1,NTA Also wedding planning is more than a 'fashion sense'. He is avoiding responsibility
djkszd,"YTA 

That you can’t feel comfortable in her messy home is YOUR problem. It’s her place and if you want it clean when you’re there then it’s up to you to clean it."
djkv5c,"NTA I kinda feel like he forfeit all rights to fatherhood with the claims that he does not want to be on the birth certificate nor has he bothered to meet the kid.

Nobody wants a part time father, let alone one that couldn’t be fucked to see you during the first moments of your life AND didn’t want to be on your birth certificate (I assume this means he doesn’t want the baby to even have his name.). I wouldn’t voice it aloud though, as you can see not many people will agree with your choice."
djkw5k,"NTA, you have morals - it’s cruel to keep rinsing this man for his generosity and leading him on. People like that are the reason people aren’t so nice anymore."
djkw7n,">I’m under the impression that since she was no longer part of the lease she has no legal right to the security deposit. So my thought process is whatever, let her sue me.

YTA and you're wrong. She paid that money, it's her deposit and should be returned to her. You have no right to keep her money. If you had an issue with how she lived, you should have taken that up with her before."
djl7lk,"YTA. You claim you were this person's friend, but when she didn't return your romantic/sexual feelings for her (something she had absolutely no control over), you withdrew your friendship.

Which means you were never really her friend in the first place.

You were just pretending to be, so you could get close to someone who you wanted to fuck. So when it was made clear to you that she didn't want to fuck you, all reason for being around her, spending time with her, being, you know, *a friend*, just faded away.

She became nothing more than someone you wanted to punish for not feeling the same way about you as you felt about her.

I'm glad it felt good for you to pretend to ignore this person who obviously still occupies a huge amount of space in your bitter, entitled brain. I hope she knows how lucky she is to have lost your phony, manipulative facsimile of a friendship."
djl9bb,"NTA

You don't owe them anything.  Just be nice about it and finish your time after handing in your notice is all you need to do."
djlikd,"NAH
I'm an artist, and although I agree that people asking for free shit is annoying, if you approach it like ""hey I know you struggle with thinking up gifts for me, but I love your artwork and I read a lot, and I don't have any bookmarks, so I had a thought that maybe you could design me a bookmark"" explain that it would be a meaningful gift for you and I'm sure they will be flattered"
djlmyv,"YTA. YOUR CAT is YOUR responsibility. Not JJs, not your other housemates.

JJ feels unsafe because you attacked her for leaving her door open, a normal thing to do, and YOUR cat escaping.

If I were your other housemates, I'd refuse to pay more. YOUR cat and YOUR temper are the reason she's leaving, and you'd be the ones paying the missing rent."
djm3wc,"ESH, you have learned a valuable lesson about being paid up front. You are never getting that money."
djm62i,"NTA

Your cousin sounds like an asshole and your family sound like asshole's for not supporting you on this."
djm9gw,NAH - Just different personalities.
djmb6m,"YTA. It’s like every evil stepmother in fairy tales was modelled off you. You’re an awful, awful person. From the way you talk about him, I’m not surprised he’s never taken to you."
djmbh4,"The phone wasn’t his mother’s to give away. The uncle gave it to OPs brother, and OP thinks that the brother would have let him have it.

OP I understand that you have to give your mother money each month, but that sounds an awfully high proportion of your pay (I’m assuming that the figure you quoted is before taxes etc). You need to allow yourself a decent amount to live on and cover all your work expenses and at least some sort of social life.

I get that it’s a different culture you live in, but you really should look at moving out if at all possible - you seem to be under your mothers thumb with. No life of your own."
djmd5y,[deleted]
djmfe8,"Nah. As a DM and player myself I can understand the frustration, on both sides. I have to side with the dm as tempo is important as well as making sure everyone is having fun. Cant see making the sacrifice over one player when there are others in the group."
djmoxq,"Totally NTA!  Your wedding, your choice. 

I can't believe your SIL thought that requesting to, ""not be a typical bridesmaid,"" was acceptable.  *smh*   Particularly after the amount of grief they have already given you regarding your wedding date.  Simply tell them that since you are trying to finalize some of YOUR wedding plans, you didn't want to place any undue pressure on them when it could be a conflict for them to even attend the wedding on the date you chose.
This statement also reaffirms your decision to have an adults-only reception, as everyone in your family obviously knows they do not allow anyone to baby-sit their children.  If they get all butt-hurt about it (which they probably will, since they have clearly already tried to make the wedding about them and their needs) you can always remind SIL of her request - as potentially just a wedding guest, she won't have to worry about being, ""a typical bridesmaid,"". After the ceremony, they'll be free to stay with their own children - at home.  Smile widely, then change the subject."
djmqqg,"NTA. They cracked it, they pay for it. It’s your phone, so you can do what you want with it."
djmrso,"NTA.
I am estranged from my family except for one brother. If that brother told anyone else in the family how to contact me I would be furious.

If and when I want to be in touch with them, I will contact them myself.

It's not your place."
djmx79,"ESH

I'm not too certain why it was so important for you to press on this issue.

You made a snide remark about something that your mom probably already regrets, feels stressed over, and can't do anything about, and when she reacted hostilely, you kept pressing on it. This is what people call ""pushing buttons"" and it generally gets you nowhere positive.

If you weren't trying to rub past failures in her face (not submitting free lunch paperwork in time), then I'm not sure what your angle was. To try and prove to you and herself that your jab was NBD? Apparently it is to her. IDK how much school lunch costs these days, but maybe the $3 she forked over (or whatever it is) represented her own lunch, or money she owed a coworker, or a chunk of her grocery money.

Your mom's behavior was totally inappropriate, and disproportionate to yours. Plus she's the adult. She's the bigger asshole for sure.

But for your own good, when one of your family members reacts hostilely to a subject, even if it was a joke or NBD to you, just drop it. Don't try to prove how ""right"" you were or how ""minor"" the topic. Unless you're really advocating for yourself or to benefit someone else, let the minor things go.

Edited to add a judgment, although I'm not totally sure this post belongs here and I feel icky about judging a kid."
djn0d1,"NTA. And yes I mean NTA, not N A H. Your mother is a slight A for applying pressure to take your 3 month old child anywhere without you or your wife, especially with you feeling so uncomfortable with it. She can bring photos and videos. I know it's not the same, but this is not a therapy puppy or a stuffed animal we're talking about. This is your child. Just gently tell your mom no."
djn0vo,"YTA but I'm on the border of NAH because you're experiencing the peer review process for the first time.  This sort of marking has to be honest.  In the scientific community, people of the same level review each other, and if you say 'it's ok' to a paper or a piece of research, you are saying that you checked, and their answer was right. Like when a study comes out saying 'this experiment produced these results', to say it was correct would be to say 'I followed the methodology and got statistically similar results, and these are my comments on the test procedure and analysis, and the conclusions I drew.'   

So from a sciencey perspective, you're basically asking 'am I an asshole for asking my friend to lie about whether this data is correct?' that's basically 'I asked my friend to overlook something so I passed' which is one down from 'I asked my friend to cheat for me.'  Of course that's not ok.

It sucks that it brought you down.  I probably would have let it go if I had known it would be the deciding factor, then explained it afterwards and checked to see if you needed some help with 'how to do exams', but some people are just compelled to always tell the truth.  Or they just don't think about consequences when they're in the middle of a specific task. Would you have marked all his mistakes as correct?

The thing to remember is this; *it wasn't just THAT mistake that cost you.*  You were on the borderline; it's not entirely his fault that decision cost you your grade - you got enough of it wrong for this to be a decider.

That means that you're blaming your friend for something that; a) he couldn't possibly have known about in that moment when he was just grading the test, and; b) wouldn't have been an issue if you weren't borderline failing the exam.  I by no means mean to crap on your head here - I've failed a bunch of stuff that I still learned from; it happens.  I once missed an exam because I was on the wrong day of the week.  You feel shit about it, and you want to blame someone else rather than go 'I should have been better at this, or tried harder' because frankly we often bite off more than we can chew in terms of challenges, and, sometimes, we end up being distracted by something else and fucking up the test we were meant to study for.  ^I ^once ^did ^an ^anatomy ^lab ^exam ^with ^a ^snakebite ^hangover. ^I ^got ^17%.  ^I ^didn't ^vomit ^in ^a ^morgue ^though, ^and ^that's ^the ^part ^I'm ^proud ^of.  ^You ^have ^to ^pick ^your ^outcome ^victories ^in ^life ^:)

Your friend didn't mean to cause you this, and if you want to keep the friendship, let it go.  He probably feels awful, when, to be fair to him, if you'd gotten the answer he wouldn't be in this position; it just would have been correct.  So it's not entirely his fault that you got caught out on it.  

You failed it.  It's ok, we fail stuff a lot in life.  But don't let something like this blow up a friendship - they are harder to gain."
djn9j7,NTA. It sounds like she needs to get a lot better at time management. It’s not fair that she’s procrastinating and then taking it out on you.
djna3o,"YTA 

Only because...

>the computer is supposedly the family computer as well

Otherwise,  it's hilarious."
djndem,"NAH

But I agree with your parents in grinding those classes out if you think  you can. If it's truly making you as depressed as you are saying then you should drop them. But if it is tolerable and you'll get decent grades continue on. (You need to try to assess that without the filter of I hate this)

You would definitely not be TA if you changed your major. But remember that while college is for finding something you love doing, it's also a place to find something that will feed you. When you discuss changing your major to your parents make sure you show them the prospective jobs in that field and equal to or better than Architecture."

djnitx,"YTA, i had a friend leave me on vacation in his home town of Chicago . Being a young female it’s very intimidating being in a city you are unfamiliar with ."
djnlf6,"NTA. You paid for it in advance, she did not."
djnsbp,"NAH. You'd definitely be learning something even if you don't believe in god.

I'm atheist too and I once joined a church choir to try and hook up with a girl. I only lost interest when she brought me to a lecture about ""saving"" homosexuals from mortal sin."
djnwl9,"NTA. You simply said about her school exactly what she said about yours. When you said ""not diverse"" you obviously meant ""not racially diverse"" which is exactly what she said about not just your school, but your life experience, despite not knowing anything about you.

Her saying, in the workplace, ""I'm probably one of the first black people you've met"" was inappropriate and race-baiting and shit-stirring.  

She shouldn't be going around the workplace making shit stirring, offensive, race based comments and then running to HR to complain whenever anyone responds to her and puts her in her place."
djo1mx,ESH except for your kids. Your ex needs to get it together and realize she still has a responsibility to her children. And you need to just pick up your kids from school. Should your ex pick them up? Yes. Is she going to? No. Just because you all can’t stand each other doesn’t mean your kids need to be caught in the middle. Don’t make them feel like a burden.
djo5ef,"Just to be clear, you want someone to make their time-demanding, physically taxing job more difficult so they don't disturb your dog?

YTA

Also, just cover the window so the dog can't see out anymore."
djo5u8,"You're asking if it was okay for you to drive unsafely and poorly (tailgating, squatting in the left lane) in an effort to deliberately antagonize another unsafe driver?"
djo5w0,"NTA

She's a creep plain and simple. 

She should be told that what she was doing was unacceptable, no need to feel bad. Looks like she got the message now."
djo6su,"NTA.

Rating people is stupid and demeaning and should be called out."
djofyw,"Sure, you could just keep your mouth shut and let them carry on with their own tirade, but you're an individual and not Switzerland. If Catie doesn't want to come off as forceful maybe she shouldn't be forceful when asking others to take on her work.

NTA, Catie and Lynn are TA for making you a pawn in their spat."
djomdw,"NTA

Obviously. Why would you be an asshole for this?"
djot3j,"NAH    

Trays aren’t meant to be slept on, but I can commiserate with the lady behind you. Airplanes aren’t comfortable for anyone, sometimes you just gotta suck it up."
djotzp,Yta. It’s a few times a year when he’s drunk and that’s what you’re mad about?? Imo him telling you he doesn’t smoke is true. Doing it like twice a year when you’re drunk isn’t being a “smoker”.
djoxra,Someone wanted something you also wanted and you have to ask if you’re an asshole for not giving it to them because they wanted it? Validation post.
djoxx9,"YTA for this line of thinking: 'selfishly choosing the easy path'.  


That is not an option for you when you have a family. What you love to do *has* to take a back seat to what's best for the people who rely on you and on whom you rely. Now, it may not be an issue right now and it may not be something you have to give up completely forever. But for sure, your kid's well-being comes first. Come on."
djp0dy,"Normally I would say you're the asshole but given the circumstances, your ex sounds straight up dangerous. This may add more fuel though, so while NTA keep that sharing off FB. It's good you went to the police and please stay safe."
djp15m,"YTA

Maybe you shouldn't sleep naked if you have company and you're worried about them seeing your dong."
djp401,"NTA - and honestly I’m concerned reading this. You go out one evening with coworkers for drinks and he accuses you of being a party animal? You’re an adult, you can go out and have drinks with coworkers once in a while. And esp since you have no friends there, you’d think he’d be happy you were able to socialize for once. That he’s not means he’s definitely got some issues. 

Are there other things he’s controlling about besides who you socialize with and where you work? (Granted those are two BIG things) Because if so, this may be something you need to either seek couples counseling for or you may want to ask yourself if this relationship is one worth remaining in."
djp5y3,"NTA

He is disrespecting you with this level of being controlling. It’s too far. 

- You texted him a lot, 

- it was only 6pm

- you had your car

- He didnt tell you he was coming to look for you, so how were you supposed to know? He could easily have texted, “Im driving over”.  

Has he ever considered you might be worried for his safety? 

Sure, men attack young women, but older folks have vulnerabilities too. Why isnt he telling you when he leaves?  If I was living with an older person I cared about maybe I would want to be told if he is leaving and why. If he expects you to live like that, why cant he reciprocate? 

- Being a woman means men target you for violence, but at 22 he cant expect you to text him every five minutes of your life and never go out at night. 

**The response to sexism shouldnt be more sexism.**

Yes, men attack women but the right response isnt to never let adult women go anywhere after 6pm. 

I felt like he was trying to make it so unpleasant that you’d never go out like that again. 

At 22 I had no contact with my parents and worked nights in a huge city.  Lots of women are out and about at night. Men also get attacked at night sometimes, anyway, but no one is telling men to stay home like they tell women. 

Get yourself a taser or something, maybe a running buddy, sure, take all the cautions you want, but ultimately your risk level is up to you, not him.

I advise moving out"
djpcum,"NTA,  there is a huge difference between bullying someone and standing up for yourself. If he has the audacity to says you bullied him after he called you a terrorist then he is very dumb. Also seems like a bad kid based on past stuff."
djpe8f,If you don't tell him YWBTA. You should tell him because he'll probably ignore you and get it anyway but at least you'll have a clear conscience.
djpeq1,NTA even if he's broke he's just using people to get free shit.

djpit9,[removed]
djpjno,"NAH. From the sound of it, you are worrying about a problem that you may or may not have. Talk to your friend to see if it's that big of an issue. Offer to celebrate her birthday another day. IMO if your friend does have an issue with it then she WBTA."
djpn2j,"First of all Lucy is not ""successful"" at an MLM. Guarantee it.

Second, NTA. I get that you feel loyalty for this person, but she's terrible at her job, and departments tend to get judged by their least effective resources. As long as you told your boss the truth, and didn't embellish, I think you're in the clear morally. Still sucks, I get it, but you didn't screw her over - she did that to herself."
djpnha,"NAH 

Your solution is lovely, the family will appreciate the card and donation without additional work."
djporc,NTA. He’s definitely overreacting
djpun8,NTA if she’s so bothered about sitting with her child she would have pre booked the seats together instead of assuming someone would give up their seat 🤷🏻‍♀️
djpvuq,"NTA. Why should you guys be paying equally when she's using up all kinds of electricity and basically living there for free? Tell them to pay up, it's only fair."
djpwtm,"NTA. The premise of your joke is ""Indian food uses lots of spices"" which is true, and therefore not at all racist. I don't understand why your friends acted so weirdly about this.

It wasn't a *funny* joke, (I'd have groaned rather than laughed) but it wasn't offensive at all!"
djpwyp,"NTA, but get a new adviser. This one is actively sabotaging you, and if you let it go for too long she absolutely will find a way to fuck you over permanently."
djpxzf,"YTA

He's your boyfriend, not your child. Use your words, don't secretly get rid of his stuff."
djq57k,"YTA

>She thinks her TV is broken so my parents took it back to the store to get her a replacement.

You're an asshole for not speaking up before your parents actually returned the TV as defective. Fucking with you sister to get her back is one thing, fucking with your parents (who were kind enough to give you this gift) makes you an asshole."
djqf61,This isn't really the right sub.  Try r/askparents maybe?
djqkef,[removed]
djqr2y,"NTA. Your wife’s behavior is a bit suspect. You can’t snoop through her phone or force her to delete the app, but a conversation about your discomfort with this situation is fine"
djqu47,"NAH. If you choose not to volunteer the information that's fine, if you were to deny knowing anything if your boss asked directly - you'd step into TA territory.  
Not call in to work isn't an asshole move either, in most cases, it's just pretty stupid - tends to put your employment at risk.  
Obviously the boss isn't TA for expecting staff to follow procedure.  
You do you, and if your coworker calls you out for not saying anything make it clear that's not your responsibility."
djquzs,"NTA, but try to head off too much argument with them by allowing them to see your passes at the end of semester?"
djqw1n,"NTA, this is such a British thing to be worried about lol"
djqz45,"NTA. He actually went behind your back  and tried to have it done before you even said no. What a fucking douche. He tried to manipulate the poor admin. He should try to get it covered by someone else, but you absolutely should not switch with him based on his actions here. You called in advance, he said he called in advance. With no proof he actually did, too bad."
djr5z0,"NAH But can I say that I don't think this is reluctance, she's in a long term emotionally abusive relationship with her parents. I have two cousins who are in essentially the same boat. And I used to be super impatient, but then in short order my 36 year old cousin and my 21 year old cousin sat down with me and talked about miserable they were and how scared they were to upset anyone. It's easy from the outside to say ""Just say no"" but these kinds of parents shut down their kids ability to even imagine independence. She's terrified & likely panicking not just at leaving but at the possible consequences of leaving."
djr6ul,"NTA- this is proven by the fact that your boyfriend is willing to do it. If it is something that bothers you, then it needs to be respected. If the girl wanted to be his best man, she probably shouldn't have ruined it by sleeping with him. I'm not aware of the specific circumstances, but based on what you're saying it sounds like she may still hold some feelings. She has shown that she has a blatant disregard for your feelings, and that is definitely not okay given the history. He can find a best man who he hasn't slept with and who respects your feelings."
djr7dc,"NTA. She shouldn't have invited herself, but I think there might be a better solution to the problem. 

Just tell her the truth about the situation. It was meant to be a small gathering with your close friend group. Then offer to make other plans with her another time. Reiterate that it isn't anything against her, but your group has been looking forward to this outing as just your group(if it's a tradition, then ahead and say that). Maybe even offer to get her something from the pumpkin patch as a ""sorry for the misunderstanding."""
djr9fx,"NTA

It's just a  joke and even the recipient (Danni) thought it was funny."
djr9t5,YTA. You are using two spots out of a total three. If you aren't paying more for using two then you have no right to refuse to vacate one of them.
djrch7,"Hell no what the fuck you don't just take photos of people without their concent. It's not like they are journalists and the flight is a big story. I'd be fucking pissed, you are for sure not the ass lol"
djrdio,"NTA, you do her work for her."
djremh,"> But all I did was ask what they were talking about. That’s it. That’s all I’ve ever done. No ones ever gotten upset about it. 

YTA - sounds like this is something you do on the regular and someone finally called you on it. You can butt into your close friends conversations but most other people will find it rude."
djrje1,"YTA. Planes are pretty tight spaces, and it’s hard to avoid seeing what people are watching sometimes. Maybe they were a recovering addict or lost someone to drug use and your video was triggering. Watch something else, ffs, and watch your drug videos in private."
djroru,"So one thing that I've noticed about \*good\* salons is that they get training to do things.. and if they haven't had the training to use a product, they don't offer that service (which if you think about it, actually makes REALLY good sense, and is a sign that it's a nice salon)..

If it's a salon that mostly caters to a white community, I can totally see them having had the training in using perming chemicals and NOT having the training/experience using the relaxers, and being scared to damage your hair  by using something that they're not comfortable with.

Not saying that you shouldn't mention it, but just throwing it out there as a reason they might do one and not the other..  Oh, and NAH (my assumption is based on my thoughts above.. if they're just racist fucks, then obviously my vote would change)."
djrpo3,YTA. You titled this like she was going to be there. Sleeping at her place to watch her dog isn’t and shouldn’t be an issue.
djrqkv,NAH it sounds like your brother is trying to be supportive of your veganism and do something nice. Why don’t you find a couple recipes that look awesome and ask him to make one? I mean you have a chef who’s willing to make you a vegan meal... use it!
djrsty,NTA. Ignorant bosses love to bully young employees. I wish more adults had helped me advocate for myself at work when I was her age.
djrv4n,"NAH. This is really your decision, but going shows support for your friend, not necessarily her marriage. Were it me, I wouldn’t want to alienate this friend in case she needs me in the future."
djrzfe,"NTA, this girl is an ass. I would have an issue with her hair being on my desk but flipping it to the point of it being in my mouth?!? YUCK! Perhaps asking her to switch seats with you wouldn’t be a bad idea. If she refuses that then I would say it’s time to get the professor/teacher involved. You have asked her to do something more than reasonable if she can’t do that it’s time to escalate. If the teacher does nothing to mediate the issue then I would react by literally biting her hair every time she flips it. Just like a dog trying to bite the water coming out of the hose"
djs0xg,YTA - If you're new to the game there is no way you can tell the difference between a skilled player and a cheat. Someone proved that point by tricking you with a command that seasoned players would know.
djs1ty,"YTA

djsoz8,"NTA-one weekend a month is a LOT.  It might sound like not much, but you’re talking 1/4 of your free time which is a large amount to spend on people you don’t care much about.

If your wife feels strongly about this, she can go by herself but it certainly doesn’t mean that you have to tag along and have two unrestful days"
djstvr,I've always thought of Indians as Asian. What are you if not Asian?
djswx1,"Honesty I actually think it’s a brilliant solution to the predicament. I suppose you could have told your family, but I’m not too sure why they care so much about the legality of it when you both clearly and publicly made a marriage vow. Kinda sounds like maybe you have some family members that love drama? NTA"
djsy38,YTA You treat your friends to a Vegas vacation but you split the cost of your family vacations? How douche-baggy.
djsyga,NTA. your dad sounds like a fuck. Making comments like that to you will do nothing but hurt you. It's not like berating you to lose weight is going to make it happen in a healthy way. Sounds like he's telling you to literally stop eating...
djszlz,"NTA. I've lived in a major city and it pretty much programmed me to behave just as you did. I know that just about everybody who tries to get my attention or talk to me (""hey sir!"") wants something, typically cash, so I'm cold as ice."
djt02p,"I personally think NAH. I dont think a pg 13 movie is too much for an 11 year old, they are likely exposed to a lot via school and the internet anyway. Correct  me if I'm wrong, but pg 13 means parental guidance suggested for kids under 13. There was an adult with them, and the kid was fine.

That being said, she absolutely has a right to say her child cant see pg 13 movies. You should have asked if it was ok, but I dont think your an asshole for not considering it. Apologize to the mom. Say that if she will still allow her child to come over, you will make certain to consult her and ask her about appropriate movies etc."
djt1t5,"Giving a NTA with a sigh. Yeah, he shouldn't be that close to you but the whole ""older men can't engage children without being seen as a perv"" bit is overrated. If you replace the older man with an older woman, does it still seem creepy? The lady may just have been getting (socially) uncomfortable because she knew he was getting in your space, not because of the interaction with her child."
djt32u,"ESH. 

Sounds like both of your were assholes to each other at one point or another, and this situation is just the culmination of it all."
djt71z,"NTA, but you have to understand that you can't control who he interacts with.  It seems clear to me that he prioritizes his new friendship with the bully over his existing friendship with you.  You'll just have to do with that what you will."
djtakw,"ESH except Carol.

You talk about it as though you should be rewarded for... helping a friend? Doing a good deed?  You know what's worse than being slowed down, and having embarrassment because a friend is making weird faces/noises?  Having a lifelong medical condition that requires you to go to the hospital on a regular basis.  And then having friends that expect you to constantly thank them for acting like a friend.

It sounds like she may be using physical contact because you aren't actually matching pace with her, and it's the way she's getting you to slow down rather than constantly having to speak up and remind you.  Listen to her concern and, if you're walking with her, start trying to actually keep pace with her so she doesn't feel like you're about to start pulling forward.

Your other friends are shitty, too, because they treat it as a burden to be pushed off instead of *helping a friend*"
djtb0q,"So... by your own admission, you’re judgmental and you shame your friends? 

Yeah, YTA"
djtbp5,ESH. being especially loud when you live in a shared space is a dick move. hiding your shoes is immature. everyone involved needs to grow the fuck up and learn how to respect other people.
djtcgu,"NTA. Honestly I was all ready to call you an asshole for not wanting to put even an attempt into finding a gift, because even if it’s not *your* love language and whatnot, if it is your partner’s you should at least make a small effort. 

But if you explicitly discussed this and both agree to not do anniversary gifts then it is not reasonable of her to get upset with you for going along with *what you both agreed on*. 

Don’t play these games OP’s girlfriend, if you want to do presents just say so."
djtg8l,"NTA

> ""I know she has mental issues, and I can tell when she’s off her meds.""

She's an adult now - Her meds are her responsibility to take now (and as someone who also has anxiety disorder, she doesn't get to shove the blame on to you; She is well aware that you cannot go on-and-off anxiety meds or miss doses.  That's like the first thing a doctor tells you when they prescribe those meds)"
djtjz8,NTA - items that may catch fire shouldn’t be in the oven! I hate when people put oven-safe things in there for storage...I definitely wouldn’t have looked first because nothing is supposed to be in there.

dju2pr,"NTA.

It would do no good to talk to him. 

But, is there a way to prevent the interaction? Tell the other guy your brother is gunning for him. Tell officials at the game something may be happening. Tell your parents. 

I realize there may be a culture of not snitching but your brother sounds like he's on a mission to really hurt the other guy. That could have serious repercussions for your brother (criminal charges, school problems, etc.) Sometimes you need to try to save people from their own stupidity."
dju3b1,"Yeah, YTA. ""We try to royally piss each other off"" and you took her calculator that she is emotionally attached to. She probably felt bad not only about the calculator but also for the fact her immature classmates were bullying her and embarrassing her in front of the entire class while the teacher ignored it."
dju3n9,"NTA, her parents need to actually sit their kid down and deal with the situation of her pestering everybody around her until she drives them off instead of foisting her off on you.

Your mom is an asshole for allowing your stepdad to treat you any differently than your half siblings. 

Your stepdad is a total douche and needs punched in the face. 

You are 16 years old and in a court of law your choice matters. It's total bull that your dad gets impacted if you don't go visit your mom. You should 10000% make sure child services knows how you are treated by your step dad so it's documented and hopefully that prevents your dad from being impacted by you not visiting. 

And you are so totally NTA for getting yourself a shake and not one for them. If it wasn't a part of their order and you didn't get cash for it from them then f*ck that!!"
djuf7y,"YTA. You aren't the asshole for wearing the hat in general. You're the asshole for wearing it in this context to a family event where much of your family is generation or 2 older than you. 

Now if you and your family are texas fans, then it would be a different story. But it seems like you are wearing the hat to make a cheeky political statement and not to support your team."

djuiou,"NTA. I can guarantee if you’re this unhappy with the placement, so is your dog. I think as long as you enlist the help of an entity, write up a detailed description of your dog and what kind of home you think would objectively best suit him, and work to find the best match you can, that’s responsible. You sound like someone who is a very caring dog owner, who is trying her best, and who cannot adequately meet the needs of this specific dog. I’ll get downvoted into oblivion for this, but I think you’d likely do well to consider a good, reputable breeder for the future, if you aren’t able to be as flexible with size/training needs/temperament quirks. Now you know. Do your best by the dog you have now, catch your breath for awhile, and reevaluate later."
djuiwt,"ESH, shitty of him to be late calling, shitty of you to leave him when he needed a ride home from a party. That leads to people making bad decisions with cars."
djulcl,"NTA - You DEFINITELY should’ve made a complaint, loud sex in an apartment complex is highly unacceptable. Have all the sex you want, but be considerate of others, that’s just so incredibly rude.

djunx0,"NTA, and I'd start saving so you can move out. In the meantime I'd suggest putting a lock on your door"
djuo72,NTA everyone grieves in their own way. And that’s YOUR BROTHER. No one will understand your bond.
djusro,NTA. That's the dumbest reasoning I've ever heard - so as soon a person hits 25+ they should just forget about their parents? Your GF's projecting her own family relationship issues onto you so hard.
djvafs,"NTA

You were expecting a fun weekend with friend and mom. Adding in a stranger, who's male, changes the entire dynamics of the trip. I don't blame you for getting upset.

Throwing it at you the night before the trip was even worse. That's why I put your mom in TA category."
djvblo,"I mean, I don't want to call you an AH because I think you have a right to do what you like, but this could really hurt people who recognize that a family tree doesn't just include blood relations.

Heck, it includes marriages that never produce children, no blood connection there. I'm not sure I can see this as a hill to die on if the people who want to do it mean well.

NAH I guess, but still, I'd let them.

Other than the first aunt. She's TA but outside the scope."

djveou,ESH who the hell works out money like this when they're married
djviqb,"NAH - But, you don't trust him as completely as you imagine. It's okay if you don't trust him, you have reason not to, but be honest about it to yourself. 

Also, it shouldn't really matter whether or not you trust Max, it should really just matter whether or not you trust the girlfriend. If you know she isn't going to cheat, then it shouldn't matter how sleazy or good looking of a guy he may be, she isn't going to betray you. 

Eventually, she's probably going to get offended because a situation like this makes it seem like you don't trust her or she's going to ask ""if you really distrust the guy that much, why are you still friends?"""
djvk58,"NTA

Technically, your Mother is correct.. unfortunately. But that does not make you an asshole at all.

It's not your job to take care of him, full stop. He's 25 years old and needs to be able to figure things out for himself. I'm an incredibly anxious person, so to an extent I understand him. But I'm 20, been working consistently since I was 16, and even though I don't have my license I take the bus everywhere or walk. It is absolutely not your duty to do this. If you offered to help, it's one thing. But now they've been expecting you to do what he needs when convenient for him. NTA at all."
djvqd6,"YTA because of how you did it- I’ve got a twisted humor like you and would give a gift like that (or expect a gift like that) from my best friend. However, it would absolutely NOT be in front of an audience, especially older family members who are likely to be quite offended."

djwek6,"NTA. Maybe it's a little unprofessional, but you get to set the rules at your own business and it doesn't sound like this guy is a customer worth having."
djwjut,"YTA. You say you ""sent condolences through your husband,"" but you ""didn’t sign the card your husband sent."" It would have been polite, and so easy, to do so.

>he thought I’d at least signed the card. To me, once ties are cut they’re cut. In my opinion, I don’t owe her a thing.

So you're acknowledging that you deliberately didn't sign the card out of pettiness, when you know it must have been hurtful to her? The fact that your husband was willing to put in an appearance at the funeral and you weren't, even though you've both been through the same things with this friend, suggests he has a better attitude than you. You can move on from close friendships while still behaving with basic kindness when the situation calls for it."
djwkys,"What the, just buy yourself a giant cup that will hold the perfect quantity for your needs."
djwl59,"I mean, OP didn't say she thinks it's too permanent a gesture. She thinks it's stupid, immature, possessive, and weird. And it is. She never indicated any issue with the permanence of it."
djwoei,"ESH - He acted like a child by not communicating to you what was wrong, even when you asked! He definitely should have just asked first, I suspect you would have been more helpful if he acted like an adult.

But - he was literally in pain. You may have the right to recline your seat but does that mean you have the right to inflict pain on another person?"
djwpfj,"NAH. I get both sides of this, but context is important.

That said, maybe sit down with your gf and talk to her about how she feels about it - not ""You agree I'm a great guy, right?"" but more ""Your friend's comments have made me question what I thought of as a shared joke. How does it actually make you feel?""

FWIW, teasing can be fun, but balance is important. Check in now and then on your ratio of teasing to genuine affection."
djwvsv,"NAH but my goodness, why do posters in this sub have such an aversion to actually communicating with the people around them?? Next time, keep the homeowner up to date on any developments that affect their home, such as guests accidentally staying too long, and you'll hopefully avoid this anxiety in the future."
djwwkk,"NAH regarding your GED. You are wrong and have a bad plan, but that doesn’t make an an asshole. 

NTA regarding your ADHD and desire to have more options for treatment."
djwy8m,NAH. He’s super stressed and snapped. Hopefully he’ll realize there’s no way you could have known and apologize. Reason I say NAH is because he’s in a pressure cooker and humans can overreact in those sorts of situations.
djx77t,NTA - I highly recommend you seek the narcotic equivalent of AlAnon.  Your uncle has been able to keep his addiction up because his family keeps bailing him out.  Sometimes the hardest thing to do is to let someone go for their (and your) own good.
djx9uq,NTA. But she is right about RAC and the second-hand shopping.
djxcsn,"NTA - the views of your BIL are extremely toxic, however, not your kids so I wouldn't say anything to them. I would try and talk sense into the BIL ... but good luck with that one!"
djxepd,"NTA - your BF plans a trip with you, then drops you to go with another woman.  Then he wants to give you seconds on a later trip.  I wouldn't be too enthused either.  About the trip or him.

&#x200B;

Edit - fixed my grammar to appease the offended"
djxfck,"NTA, but kind of an idiot. What's on the paper always outweighs what the person is saying to your face at the time. Always read the contract thoroughly, even if they say it's standard boiler plate, and always make sure you agree with all aspects of the contract, even if they say it won't come into play."
djxfrw,"YTA, not only for using poop bags but for being so disengaged with what's going on in your own home.

1. They misspelled your daughter's name and you didn't notice or care. Birthdays are a BFD to a 6-year old.

2. You asked your daughter what was the most important thing. This is her birthday, and you put the onus on her to tell you what to do. Why do you have to be told what to do at every step? Have you never been to one of your kid's friends' birthday parties? Think for yourself what has to be done!

3. You describe your contribution as ""the attempt I made at helping."" Definitely makes it sound like it was your wife and child's thing, and you were only there to help. You weren't part of it.

4. The fact that you didn't realize that you put the gifts in poop bags implies that you didn't know they were poop bags. Which implies you never walk the dog or pick up its poop. Which implies your wife does that too.

So it sounds like she does everything around the house and for the family, and you're just a part-time disengaged participant. My guess is that if you were planning the birthday party alongside her, and taking care of all the little problems along the way, she wouldn't have minded if using poop bags for the party bags was your way of working around the situation where you forgot to buy party bags. In fact, she might have laughed at your creativity. But it sounds like everything is always on her and you only do things if you're directly told.

If you didn't want to be an actual part of a family, you shouldn't have started one.

Edit: So after 10 years on this site, this is far and away my most upvoted (and I assume downvoted) comment ever. There were a lot of responses, more negative than positive, so rather than reply individually, I'll explain a bit more here.

First off, there were a lot of comments calling me a cunt, bitch, or worst of all, a Karen. One person said they could tell my gender just from my post. Someone else said that I have no idea what it's like to be a father. Well, I hate to break it to you guys, but I'm a dude. A father dude with 2 teenage daughters.

I think one reason for the harshness of my reply is that I was just like OP when my kids were younger. In fact, I'm probably more like OP now than I care to admit, but I'm trying to be better. I was the sole breadwinner for the family, so I had a sense of entitlement that my wife should handle all the domestic stuff. To some extent, that was fair. I was at work, and she was at home raising the kids. It's something we agreed upon since I had better earning potential and we wanted our kids raised by an actual parent instead of a nanny. But I took that entitlement too far. I disengaged from the household stuff to a point where I missed out on being part of my family. Being a partner on the household stuff can be a pain to be sure, but it's part of being a family. I think my tone was intended to grab OP by the shoulders and shout, ""Pull your head out of your ass! You're missing out!""

The idea of just ""helping"" with stuff like this reminds me a lot of when people say that fathers who are home alone with the kids are ""babysitting"". No, they're parenting. If you're just helping your wife execute this party, it's the equivalent of babysitting rather than parenting.

One last clarification on point #2, since that was the point that a lot of people who otherwise agreed with me disagreed with. It's really hard for a 6-year old to know what the most important thing is. All she knows is that she wants a party. She should not be setting priorities like a client or project manager. If you were running up against time constraints, you could say something like, ""Honey, we were hoping to do all of this stuff for your party, but you know what? We ran out of time! I still need to make party bags, put up streamers, and hang up balloons. I'll try to get them all done, but if I can't, which one of those things is most important to you?""

OP, I'm sure your wife doesn't expect you to be perfect. Mistakes happen. But you seriously give off a vibe of just doing what you're being told and not being an active participant."
djxfru,"I think you just need the relationship advice thread. NAH. You think you're making a date, he thinks you're just telling him when you'll be home. Y'all need better communication and some actual planned-in-advance date nights."
djxg6j,"ESH - You need a super thick skin to put up with these animals. Punishing the dbags who were abusive is one thing, but holding up everyone in their line behind them is obviously not good."

djxvbv,"NAH. The compromise is to have them baptize when they are old enough to choose.

If you can’t agree to that, then you need a third party mediator/therapist. If she’s truly atheist, the baptism shouldn’t matter, because it doesn’t mean anything. There is a deeper discussion that needs to happen here."
djxvty,"NAH.  As a mom your only job is to keep your minor son alive. From a biological perspective, you should do anything and everything to make that happen. Realistically, you can't prevent him from seeing his boyfriend, so education, PReP, condoms, education, support, bringing is BF into your house as much as possible so that they can have eyes on them, education and support will probably work better until they break up. Forbidden love tends to be very sexual.  Your intention is not bad, but your  methods are just not effective."
djy30v,">I walked into the bathroom today during lunch to alleviate my period

This really doesn't sound like something a human female would say."
djy8qm,"YTA.

You should have never ghosted her.  That was such an inconsiderate way to end a friendship of 15+ years with someone you claim to have been madly in love with to the point of proposal.   She at least deserved a conversation and an explanation.

I'm not saying you made the wrong choice; I'm just saying you did it in a horrible way."
djy98h,"I thought this was gonna go the other way but NTA, maybe leave one or two but it was your wedding and it's your call. The photographer should have only taken the pictures he was supposed to."
djyez8,ESH but mostly you. What you said in class was fine - she was in the wrong. But then you dragged it from real life onto social media. You started with the name-calling. You seem like you've been building a grudge against her for a while and this just gave you an excuse to let it out. You did attack her and frankly it does seem like you're obsessing over this. Go apologize if you want to be her friend again.

But judging by your other comments and posts you're a recovering alcoholic yourself and you relapsed very recently. You also say you haven't loved her in a ""long long time,"" so you're not really in a position to judge her for looking for love elsewhere. 

Her new boyfriend and the unlikely possibility of a move to Denver is not the problem here, though - the problem is the more immediate one of your children's wellbeing. It's great that you're working towards recovery, but neither of you is in a position at the moment to have children in your care.

You have a right to get your stuff back, but your timing is way off.   It seems like they’re not giving it back to you out fo spite now, which is bad too.  

Their kid is dead and when you have an unexpected death like this, there can be a lot of sadness and anger for a long time.  I don’t know if there’s any right way for you to get your stuff back now."
dk1byn,"YTA for not listening and considering a position other than your own. She didn’t accuse you of having bad intent, she tried to show you how your actions could be misinterpreted and still cause harm even without bad intent. She’s trying to keep you from making an ass out of yourself unintentionally, and you probably ought to be listening to her. She’s probably right."
dk1dwt,"Stop wasting your time with idiots. You're not 13 years old, you know Richard is irredeemably assholish - just cut him off and explain to everyone you did it because of what a dickhead he is. NTA"
dk1fs5,"NTA, if she’s going directly against doctor’s orders and hurting you more she shouldn’t be around"
dk1hri,"YTA

Phenomenally the asshole. You're allowed to be uncomfortable with drugs, and you should even express this to Brad, and Tyler - but you never mentioned the pills to Brad so he's well within his range here to not realise it bugged you.

Judging by your use of the word pills, and class As, I'm going to take a stab and guess they did MDMA.

Brad didn't offer it to Tyler to manipulate him or whatever, he likely intended to give him a boost. 

I understand you lost a friend to an OD but this is a weird pearl clutching reaction if ever I've seen one."

dk1lab,"NTA Taking money without asking is called theft. It's a crime, you could call the police and have him arrested, but I don't recommend that. However, you can't live with someone you can't trust."
dk23zb,"NAH

I think this is a bit too complicated for reddit. It would probably be beneficial for both of you to talk to someone professional about how to handle the situation best. Maybe best if you do it together."
dk2a45,Sooooo.... why didn’t you pay it? Instead of not going and then getting mad at her.
dk2au5,"Be careful of some centers... I recommend going to a Planned Parenthood because they are medical professionals. Most crisis centers aren’t staffed by professionals and they just fear monger against abortions. PP offers advice and counseling and they have information on adoption and might be able to point you in the right direction for legal aid as well if your parents start to interfere.

ETA: I understand OP doesn’t want to terminate. I don’t want her end up at a clinic that spreads misinformation and doesn’t offer options and informed, scientific information.  PP will provide up to date medical information as well as information about adoptions. They will also help you with vitamins, scans, etc to make sure baby (and mama) is healthy and stays healthy. I also believe they will keep all of this information confidential if you don’t want your family to find out."
dk2fl9,"NTA

Your husband shouldn't voluntell you to watch other people's kids.  If the kid comes over, either your husband or the kid's father need to be there to help supervise the kids.  You aren't babysitting"
dk2mcg,"NTA. If this is repetitive behavior and is disrupting the rest of the tenants, calling the police isn’t a bad idea"
dk2n2u,"NTA- If you talk to J about it first. Because if he is your friend you owe him at least that. Maybe you are reading too much into it? Maybe J and K have an arrangement.  You’re concerned for your friend being hurt, but you don’t know the details of their relationship.

If you run straight to K then unfortunately that makes YTA.  

Either way... my opinion is just stay out of it."
dk2ovm,NTA. She parked illegally (I assume) blocking a private road and thus your way out of it. Maybe you saying that will prevent her from parking inconsiderately (and potentially illegally) again
dk2rkt,"ESH. Ditching her at a restaurant is unkind and a little dramatic. Talking to complete strangers in a baby voice is crazy and embarrassing. I don’t blame you at all for being frustrated and walking away, but she’s your wife, and sometimes people we love are imperfect. Try to react with kindness - she’s probably an exhausted walking zombie right now. 

That being said, her behavior is weird and atypical for new moms. I’d have a sit-down conversation, and don’t let her laugh it off - if she starts brushing it off again, I’d say, “I’m not joking, this is strange behavior that’s really starting to worry me.” Make it crystal clear you’re disturbed. And if she persists, tell her you’re not interested in a date night until she can act like an adult."
dk2u19,"ESH

It's bizarre to say someone else can't be cheating because you're supposedly similar people. You shouldn't have gotten involved. She sucks for blaming you for her own decision to follow your comments. She could have been reasonable and ignored such a strange assertion that you would know if he's cheating."
dk2u2y,"YTA. It's not your place to tell her how to protest. You could have had a conversation and set up safety guidelines for you both but that's not what you did. You ""blew up on her"". I get that you were scared, but that doesn't mean you get to control her"
dk2y4s,NTA This is a sad story. You don't owe them anything just because you can afford it.
dk3dcq,"YTA. 

Why don’t you like the guy? Is it only because she’s spending time with him and not you? Because that’s normal when you get in a relationship, and if you get mad that she’s not prioritizing you then that doesn’t really make sense.

Edit: added judgement"
dk3m4l,"NTA but I guess I could see where she’s coming from, if she thought people were in and out of her room. Carrying on for months? That’s absurd."
dk3nzq,"> I'm considering telling him to rid of the cats because we arent allowed to have them to begin with

Not allowed to have cats... but has three cats he doesn't care for, and mountains of cat shit are accumulating in litter boxes. Yikes.

Info - out of curiosity, are you allowed to have dogs?

Edit: ESH. Your housemate sucks most, but you're complicit in breaking the rental agreement."
dk3p0w,"NTA

Where I live a pretty common rule is anything over hanging on your property is fair game. 

But that wasnt the case. They climbed over your fence and then proceeded to destroy your property. That's at least vandalism and tresspassing.

I'd have called the cops too.

By the way, I am an American and I wouldn't have confronted him either. Guy already had enough balls climbing your fence and trespassing, who knows how he might have responded if confronted?"
dk3pxu,"NTA, your friend totally is, but so is your gf. You should be 'tougher'? Holy toxic masculinity, batman!"
dk3r51,"It sounds like you don't want to face up to the fact that your friend is growing away from you, and are blaming his girlfriend for it. Women cannot hypnotize men with their magic vaginas, odds are he's pulling away from you because he wants to. YTA."
dk3vun,"YTA.

What if she genuinely needs the time for her kids? Kids take up a lot of time and it's great that she wants to be there for them. Not only that but I feel like you're being way too personal with her. Who cares what she does with her own life! She doesn't want to work and would rather spend the time with her children, good for her.

Edit: I wanted to add something, actually. Although you may be right that she is leeching off the government, Id like to point out that this sub is ""AmITheAsshole"" not ""AmIRight"". So yeah, you're right but you're being an asshole about it"
dk3vza,Is this really how you talk?
dk44hh,NTA as a mixed person I would NEVER say that to my black parent and would never say that to anyone period. She is your daughter so I wouldn't kick her out of your life forever (not that you were implying that) but remember this and dont forgive here right away. I would suggest therapy or time away for yourself. Also you are not a shitty mom.
dk45aw,"NTA, but you basically said she can’t be trusted and some people take offense to that. That said, it’s silly for her to complain because she’s making you go through an X-ray machine because the public can’t be trusted not to hurt people."
dk47fs,"YTA. People usually dont bring towels when they're staying over a friend's house. No need to call them idiots for not bringing their towels. You have 2 clean towels and 2 friends, do the math. It's nasty and unhygienic to share a towel."
dk4a3u,"NTA but be ready for the repercussions/fallout.  Gran dying is one but let's face it, any family member at any time could do so as well.  If she does though, that's an entirely different situation.  If you can handle the worse case scenario, you are fine.  Either way, NTA."
dk4alt,"YTA. His balls, his choice. I can't even imagine your maturity level if something like this is a real issue."
dk4e9i,[deleted]
dk4ehy,YTA. It’s not **your** college. You just attend it like thousands of other people. You can’t gatekeep a college.
dk4hl9,"...why does your husband even allow his mother to entertain the thought of aborting, when you’ve both clearly wanted this for a while? Who tf let’s their mom say shit like that? He needs to grow some balls and tell her to fuck off. NTA"
dk4hor,NTA - that parent is insane. I agree it’s not even about sexualizing a baby but about her privacy. Babies are people.. you can’t just post full on naked photos of them what the fuck
dk4ku8,"NTA - jeebus, what a thing to dump on you.

I'm sorry your dad is so obtuse, but feel no guilt about doing whatever you need to do to process this"
dk4kwt,"NTA

She isn't telling people she is in a relationship because she doesn't consider herself to be in one."
dk4oma,ESH. Your SO needs to tell his parents to butt out. And you're trivializing his sister's issues the same way his trivialize your's. Two wrongs don't make a right.
dk4pv7,"NTA. They're probably working on the assumption that you'll always be there to slag off and treat badly because ""family is important""."
dk4q4l,"YTA you’re creating drama where none is needed.  By the way, you’re going to cringe hard on this when you’re 25.

And dude...all is forgiven if he’ll trade you for Reece’s."
dk4r2u,"NTA - they could have sold it themselves if they wanted.

Once you give something to someone else, it's no longer yours to dictate what happens to it"
dk4rek,Wow. YTA. Majorly. He “works”? Sounds like he has plenty on his plate except the takeout you apparently don’t think he deserves.
dk4vox,NTA. Time to remove that toxicity from your life and move on.
dk4ws9,NTA sorry you're working with a toxic person.
dk50k1,"He told you to come to school, you didn't. Why are you even allowed to go to parties when you were home from school cause you were sick?"
dk50pe,"NAH, you just need to talk to them that you can't check everything for them, maybe they don't realise that it is so bothersome, they will probably understand."
dk50wp,"YTA

You picked your outfit, he picked his. He isn't obligated to dress to the level you chose. If it is important for you to match, that's your value and you can choose to change. But it isn't something he is doing to you, these are your expectations for how couples should look."
dk52v2,"YTA.

>Where we live, there really isn't anything to do at night except go out drinking. 

As long as you have that mentality, something tell's me Gary's going to have a hard time dealing with his alcoholism."
dk590j,"NTA

You were behaving normally, I think this person was just trying to undermine your confidence."
dk5a0y,NTA-You’re not saying your husband’s friend cannot visit but that he cannot stay in your home. They can still do things together he just needs to make arrangements for other lodging.
dk5bg2,"NAH. You are the one giving birth, you run the show.  But, speaking as someone who has given birth, reconsider.  You will care 0% about how you look when the time comes. You will care about absolutely nothing except getting that baby OUT.  

Talk to your husband honestly about your worries. I bet you'll feel better."
dk5da0,"NTA but save your money. My best friend has worked in college admissions for over a decade and she’s sitting here feeding me this advice, so take it. 

In her words, 1500 is already a good score and you’ve already demonstrated that you can improve your baseline based on the increase you experienced from sophomore year. If your grades are dragging you down, you need to focus on improving those grades and not wasting valuable study time on taking the SAT again. The SAT is not going to prevent admissions officers from noticing your GPA—tackle the problem head on."
dk5enp,"YTA- your girlfriend does not need to base her education decisions on your anxieties. Break up with her if you don’t want to be with her, honestly that might be doing her a favor."
dk5epk,NTA. You shouldn't have to keep holding a clearly toxic connection with somebody just because they're family.
dk5fp5,"NTA, you were sick, and you spent a lot of money on her present for some reason. 

I have never seen anyone ever spell the word “being” this way before, though. I’m kind of stumped by this."
dk5li9,"NTA - she said no. i’m so tired of men thinking women saying no is just a suggestion. i’m sure she was laughing bc that’s what we often do as a measure of safety.  it’s not harmless fun, it’s reinforcing that women don’t get to choose “no” as an option. 

thank you."
dk5p36,"NTA- as someone who plays Pokémon go, this is a total asshole move. Can’t imagine why he would do that, and then screen shot it to you so rudely?  Filling out the dex and collecting a shiny of your fav Pokémon is the whole point of the game.  That was a direct diss.  It may be just a game but it’s important to OP, and that guy was supposed to be a friend."
dk5pkr,NTA I would stay the hell away from that fight. Nothing good can come from you being dragged into it.
dk5r3r,"NTA
You catered to them already!  They don’t get to dictate what the group does.  I’d simply tell them they can come and play the game or come and just hang out but that the other people coming are going to play"

dk5x89,"In theory I want to say you’re an asshole, family should step up and help each other out in times of crisis. But in actuality NAH, It’s a HUGE responsibility to take in an 8 yr old and 2 yr old. I’m sure you have your own job and responsibilities. You’d have to figure out daycare and pay a considerable amount for it. You’d have to figure out schooling for the older one (could she stay in the same school, have to start a new one, etc)  And alter your schedule to be able to pick up/drop off. Plus the responsibilities (and possible costs!) of medical care, dental care, diapers, feeding them, entertaining them, raising them. If your life isn’t conducive to having kids, you’re not an asshole. Especially as you didn’t know how long this would last. I know my career (with crazy, long hours and frequent travel) isn’t conducive to taking in 2 kids. 

That said, if I were your sister, I’d probably be very hurt to realize that I didn’t have anyone to help with my kids on a time of crisis. Even if it shouldn’t be expected, I’d still be disappointed and hurt and upset for my kids."
dk63uj,"YWBTA if you brought your gf to a reunion consisting of homophobic shitheads.

I'd suggest you skipping that reunion and taking out your gf to a nice restaurant. Would save you and your gf a lot of negativity and you'd get to spend some quality time together too!"
dk68gx,NTA. You could also give people the option to bring their own or rotating who is responsible for supplying the wine if they don't like the idea of contributing money
dk6c91,"YTA you guys aren't even together, so you certainly dont deserve to know. Nor are you entitled to essentially steal the info from her. For shame dude. 

Learn your lesson and move on. You guys aren't cut out for each other."
dk6gyi,NTA. He was putting both of you in danger. Distracted driving pisses me off.
dk6j41,"YTA, because you don't actually know that they were pocketing it as tips. They probably just used it to pay for the officers' meals anyway.

And making a fuss now over the dollar a week you spent would be petty. Just move on."
dk6msj,"NTA - You do stand to lose the people you love if they find out you don’t believe. It hurts, but all too often we learn that the love of our family and friends is conditional, dependent on being part of the faith. Unbelievers are looked down on by all major religions in the worst manner."
dk6nav,"ESH she didn’t need to make the joke but you need to get over yourself. and yeah 9” is a thing, deal with it."
dk6qqe,God I detest this place
dk6r96,YTA. It's his yard and it's not even racist? Does he only get to have a white Santa since he's white?
dk6tvz,"NTA but if I were you, I wouldn’t open that door, even a tiny crack, because you have no idea what might come through the other side. Let it be. She is sick and will never be well, and you’ve overcome all of it to make a beautiful life. Have you ever explored Adult Children of Alcoholics? You have a tribe."
dk6vbb,"NTA If he thinks he can leave a weeks worth of dishes sitting around without cleaning any of them, he definitely doesnt have high standards of cleanliness. This probably will never change.  You need to think about whether you can live with that or tey other options such as hiring a cleaner."
dk6wrp,NTA.  I would totally back off and let him do the rest.  It sounds like he's asking you and several other people to do the leg work that he should be doing and avoiding making a decision.
dk6y8a,Pornhub has an option to report videos. Just do that.
dk70cy,Nta why does he want to go? If he’s not going to the concert their is no reason to ride along? Sounds like he wants a free trip?
dk70ph,NTA. Tell him to ask someone else!
dk74el,[deleted]
dk74jk,"YTA for the phrasing of this question alone. Also, YTA for being flippant about a panic attack, which is a friggin' terrifying thing to have to go through."
dk78kr,"NTA. You didn't damage anything and you left it where it would be easily found. You didn't scream at anybody. Also, if it's the restaurant you work at, you reasonably have a responsibility to keep the sidewalk clear - for mobility-challenged customers if no one else."
dk7cvu,NTA. You don’t have to put up with someone’s disrespectful behavior just because you’re their mode of transportation. It doesn’t work that way.
dk7dsi,"Yeah, YTA, and I'm honestly impressed with the restaurant for accommodating you the next day.


This is one of those situations like... are you wrong for asking that you order be made correctly? no, not really... but YTA for pushing when 

1. You ordered right before close 2. It wasn't even the restaurants fault

What you did is rude. I know exactly the type of customer you are, and you're lucky they even answered the phone after close. This is one of those things most people just take the L on... you become an asshole when you escalate it into a whole situation."
dk7fkk,"NTA. Explain this to your future mother in law. She can spend her money however she wants, but you telling her all of this would probably make her think twice. Maybe she could fund private school education for your daughter instead. Her school sounds terrible."
dk7izm,"NTA at all, you were a good friend trying to deal with it but he took it too far and when you told him that it made you uncomfortable he definitely too it too far, you made the right choice to get out before he started drawing you in furry fashion"
dk7j2j,"NTA and if it’s this serious, report it behind her back if you have to but tell someone. You don’t have to deal with abuse. If your parent won’t stick up for you, or themselves, go to a teacher and tell them when he is being physical. Tell a counselor. Tell a police officer. Have someone on record of knowing what’s going on. It will save you a big headache later on when he gets worse, and he will get worse if someone doesn’t check his behavior. He need therapy."
dk7ogn,"NTA, because you were directly asked and you told the truth. If he expects you to lie, he's a bit of an asshole. 

I'd leave him alone about it, though. People are allowed to experiment with their self-presentation and college/university is the best time to do that. 

If he gets negative social consequences he'll probably stop on his own, but you don't need to try to stop him. It's probably not reflecting on you unless you feel compelled to join in."
dk7ses,"NTA. You supported him, he should want to support you, and you aren't asking much. He shouldn't be trying to act like he's doing ypu a favor. He's showing you a bit of his true colors here."
dk7u9c,"YTA. You’re both adults now. If you don’t want to pay for her cooking, then cook for yourself or buy food somewhere else. She is in no way obligated to feed you."
dk7wxk,"NTA. You’ve been working for so long and then you got sick. I think you deserve a break. It’s unfortunate that it coincided with their visit, but you’ve got to put your health first. Now considering you see them very little, is you illness debilitating? I would go see them for a dinner or something mild. A catch up if I was able to hold a conversation and I wasn’t going to make my illness worse. I think that would be a worthy compromise?"

In my opinion, she of all people should understand why you’re doing this if you both need the money. She’s taking this too personally, you’re just being realistic"
dk80xe,"NTA.  She went into this planning to use you, I'm sure.  Just worked out for her that you're a decent guy who respected those boundaries.

If she wants affordable insurance she can stop driving like a maniac."
dk82cw,"ESH

What are you? 5? Just tell her about it."
dk84wn,YWBTA - you just want a different answer from the one she has given you...that she is in love with someone else
dk8ayy,"NTA. You aren’t obligated to stay in a situation that makes you uncomfortable regardless of the physical ability of the person making you uncomfortable. If the passerby was so concerned that this man have someone to talk to, there was nothing stopping them from continuing the conversation."
dk8gao,NTA. Your dad is a manipulative and gaslighting asshole who needs serious mental help.
dk8m42,"NTA 

I can’t even begin to understand why they’d tell a 16yr old that his dad may not be his dad and then refuse a paternity test."
dk8noi,"NTA
That whole “Love your family no matter what” lesson is BS. If you’re brother is being a huge jerk, you do not have to interact with him just because he is your brother.

dk97d8,"NAH - It might be suggestive that it’s your brothers kid, which I can see he doesn’t like. Plus, she’s technically your cousin and he might find referring to her as a cousin whilst you refer to her as a niece a bit confusing. No asshole here because fair enough he has that opinion, and fair enough you want to call her that. Great that you have a close bond though, that’s really nice!"
dk98z8,"NTA - if he asked you to be there, there should have been more effort on his part to be with you. Especially since it seems like you’re only upset about the lack of attention after most of the groomsmen activities were over. Happy you were able to have a pretty good time otherwise, OP!

Also - I think head tables with the bridal party are a crazy thing to include if the bridal party can all bring dates. It’s so outdated."
dk992d,"NAH, but I think you should try and explain why you are distancing yourself if only to give her a reality check.  It sounds like she really needs a mental health professional to help her change before she destroys herself."
dk9az0,"NTA. Your husband desperately needs a spine. Don’t go. Don’t keep setting yourself on fire to keep your husband warm. Block your SIL on everything and think about doing it to your MiL too. You don’t need their drama, also drop the damned rope. Stop interacting, stop worrying and just stop caring what they think and say and do not get involved with anything to do with either of them anymore. No more cards, birthdays, calls, nothing. Let your husband deal with it and tell him you are doing so. Its his turn to learn what its like to have them going at him constantly. Couples counselling would do you both wonders and your hubby needs therapy individually as well to grow a spine and uninstall the guilt buttons they both brainwashed him with. 

Stop allowing yourself to be abused by them. And stop thinking its okay for your husband to subject you to it. Imagine if you have kids. Set boundaries and stick to them . I am so sorry this is happening to you.

dk9b0s,Why do you value courtesy over protecting your child from harm?
dk9bvk,"NTA.

Dance lessons around free weights is dangerous for everyone involved. reserving the stretching area for a period of time sounds like a much better idea."
dk9cpy,NTA. I’d do the same.
dk9e1v,"NTA but this confrontation won't be of any help, just make both of you even more pissed off."
dk9g7n,"NAH- I’d err on siding with your husband, and he absolutely has to be on board before you tell your son it’s ok for her to move in. The well-being of your remaining 7 children should take precedence over your son and his ex, who have already disrespected your rules and made a pretty bad decision."
dk9g96,YTA literally no one wants to grow up being called Huron. It doesn’t matter the significance it has to you. Give your kid a break.
dk9g8x,NTA but did you really need the internet to tell you that? You’re “friend” is a predator. 24 years old and probably always the “first” to get to these girls. He needs to be arrested - you know this is illegal right?
dk9gzx,NTA but talk to the GM about this
dk9lnm,NTA you gave her the cat on the condition you were going to see the cat again. If the lady doesn't want to abide by those terms then she shouldn't have it.
dk9mnw,"NTA

It was nice of you to share your space with them.

It was not nice of them to take advantage of your kindness.

You've done your part, and they've used up anything you owed them; you don't owe them anything more, no matter what they think.

People who use other people very often get angry and abusive when they are called out or cut off.  Protect yourself and get ready to weather the storm.  Good luck."
dk9vgh,"NTA, the school should be doing their best to accommodate you for your issue. You can't help this kind of stuff."
dk9x3v,"NTA.  I think kindly asking her to shut of the unnecessary generator when the power is back on is absolutely fine.

INFO, she's a widow, which conjured the idea of an elderly woman.  Does she require oxygen or some other reason why it's important for her power to be on?  If so, YWBTA for telling her to shut it off even after 22:00 if the power was still out, bylaws or no.

But power back on?  Shut the noise machine off."
dk9yv8,"Going to go with YTA (probably won't well agreed with but oh well) 

>Sr Colleague. He informed me that Sarah wasn't picking up and asked me to knock on her door

You were asked to go wake her up. You were told by a senior member to go get her and had the opportunity to help a friend, but instead you chose to let her get in trouble. Yeah, she made a mistake missing the meeting but you intentionally didn't knock or call. Your management is probably under the assumption you tried to wake her by knocking on the door and probably think she wasn't in her room now. 

>She's probably gonna get canned for this but oh well

I'm just relieved she didn't fuck you. You clearly don't give a fuck about her at all."

dkaeto,"NTA. I used to ref youth soccer. Some people try to win by strongarming everyone. It's your duty to stand up to them—ergo, for everyone being bullied by Jake. I'm sure all the kids on the other team and parents were on your side but just not saying anything because they're scared, too. FIFA would stand behind you."
dkaj90,"NTA your life is cluttered with things that require ALOT of attention so, i am gonna give my condolences and leave."
dkakpj,NTA your mother sounds like a child
dkam22,"YTA. He probably asked for it to try it for the first time and then decided it wasn’t for him. And, it’s not like he didn’t apologize for hurting your feelings. But you decided to throw a temper tantrum anyways."
dkaok5,"Yeah, YTA. Not a huge asshole, but come on. You know that they're old, you know that they don't want to be impolite or entitled by asking you for your seat. It's common courtesy give them your seat if you have no physical limitations that would make standing difficult for you."
dkatlw,NTA. Biological ties do not obligate you to deal with people who treat you poorly.
dkaufa,YTA - so he went to one weekly team event where other ppl count on him to be there rather than cancel plans for a visit he had nothing to do with planning? He is allowed to have a life and commitments outside of family.
dkb0g8,"NAH here regarding the situation itself. (He’s TA for homophobic statements). However...he thinks you are best friends, and he’s just a weed connection to you? And you are willing to overlook his homophobia for weed?

There’s a lot happening here that you are avoiding thinking about.  I find it deeply sad that 1) he thinks you are besties and you only value him for his weed and 2) you don’t feel comfortable telling him about an important part of your life."
dkb57w,"ESH. If both teams are trying to establish this as ""your turf"" to practice *every* weekend you really need to go to the city/parks department and get a permit/reserve space or something. If it were once a month or here and there, sure, but by doing this every weekend at a specific day and time that conflicts with other groups you're both now causing problems and getting into conflict with one another.

Both teams are claiming public space as their own and monopolizing large sections of it every weekend without any authorization to do so. Obnoxious and rude. It ""belongs"" to neither of you. If you can't work it out yourselves I'm sure the city is happy to arrange it for you--for a price."
dkb6u5,YTA. Throwing separate showers and causing more drama because you can't make nice and get along with your friend's family. Planning a separate shower while already at an event with these people. Just really immature all around.
dkb7z7,"YTA - Imagine telling someone you don't know ""Ha ha, OK then see you next year"" and they come back with ""I've got terminal cancer, so no you won't!"". How do you think you'd feel about that?"
dkb880,"NAH: I’m typically as hardcore childfree as they come, but I understand needing to travel due to emergencies for family and such. Truthfully, I don’t rightly give a flying lizard clit what ticket you buy. Just see to your baby if s/he starts crying, don’t be one of those assholes who just sits there like a human tumor while junior is wailing the cries of the damned."
dkbbbc,Go back and put the other dollar in
dkbcya,NTA. I was gonna say you weren't obligated by any means but it'd be a nice thing for you to do for the kids and your ex. But a week-long trip with two boys and an old guy??? That's a huge ask. I wouldn't feel comfortable with that either.
dkbd3p,"NAH, just a bunch of situations that no one could have really predicted I think. That, or a lack of communication between the groom and the BF.

You can't return the costume?"
dkbnif,"NTA - frankly, you don’t owe him anything. So regardless of the justifications for why he ghosted you, you have every right to not want to be friends with him anymore with no reason."
dkbo6w,"NAH it’s not your job to provide for his children with other people.  

The only exception would be if it was stuff he’d paid for directly and let you know he wanted back. 

Anything your daughter has at his house he can pass down. But at your house? No."
dkbwkn,"NTA, tell him now so he can take care of it and be able to function in society."
dkbyog,"Now that you are 18 take her off the account. In fact, close that account entirely and go to a different bank. I have read plenty of stories over at r/personal finance and r/justnomil that just closing it may not be good enough. 

You are really doing future you a favor by trying to minimize your loans. SMART YOU!!! FUTURE YOU THANKS YOU!!! ~ I say this as someone who worked the same way, but am swimming in student loans. I wish I was as smart as you. 

You can ask for the money back and you should but if both folks are broke I don't see it happening. At the very least get an IOU signed by both and maybe you can ""call it in"" a few semesters in, if they are in a better position."
dkc159,"Esh, obviously. Except for your sister, I think. 

Your parents are overly-controlling of their grown-ass adult children.
Your brother needs to mind his own damn business.
You were an asshole to spill his secret (though he did have it coming).

Just be honest with your parents. Life is too short to be hiding a bunch of stupid things from people. They'll either accept you for the adult you are, or your life will get a lot simpler when they decide to cut you out, but honestly who would do that over a tattoo?"
dkc45e,"Nta, that's super rude behavior."
dkc5we,"YTA. You’re “not ready for these kinds of issues”?  Stfu. You moved in with your girlfriend.  That’s a pretty adult move. 

If you want the games over her, go for it. Tell her now so she can move out and move on."
dkc69b,"YTA, because you’re not giving them their allotted ten minutes before you take their room. People should be able to go pee or make a quick call without some jerk taking their practice room."
dkc9wd,"NTA. Alternatively you could let him keep it and get a new one. 

However. 

He, a 31 year old man, sleeping on an air mattress convinced a woman to have sex with him? I have so many questions."
dkcbgf,"YTA. If you’re fed up than move out and pay everything yourself. Only reason why you are able to save money for anything is because your parents let you stay at home. If you’re dad is having a rough time and you’re able to help, FUCKING HELP. How many rough patches did he go through in your lifetime with out you ever knowing? And now you’re an “adult” and adult things happen like spending money on bills instead of fun. You’re young and will make plenty of money. Your family is not here for ever. You really want to create a bad relationship with them over money?"
dkcf14,"I mean, you do kinda sound like a jerk here. If someone told you any other announcement is that how you would respond? ""I bought a house!"" ""Ok, want a gold star?"" It just seems unnecessarily confrontational for someone you work with. YTA"
dkcfu1,NTA. Your reproductive plans or nobody’s business. Your family is behaving extremely disrespectfully. Moving out sounds like a really good plan.
dkcg3i,"Eesshh 


I mean technically no and you won’t know till you talk to your fwb about how they feel (they could be really chill about it) but my rule is if you feel you have to ask you probably know it ain’t great. 
I mean maybe your fwb doesn’t feel romantically towards you but would still feel some type of way about it and like she lives with that person. If I were you I would wait to see if the roommate shows any real interest ( like plan a for real date) before even considering opening that can of worms."
dkch47,"Pre-gaming is pretty standard, so you're NTA. Shoulda shared tho.
 
However, if you were already buzzed enough for her to notice, it's quite possible you showed up to hang with your friend drunk. That makes YTA."
dkchsu,"YTA. Just tell her because when she finds out from someone else (and let's be honest she probably will) it's going to cause so much drama. Even IF your mom is upset about you going (which wouldn't be your fault btw) at least you were honest with her and avoided the whole ""why did you keep it a secret from me etc."" speech that is gonna happen once she finds out you went."
dkcik7,NTA and the teacher is the asshole for not understanding. But yeah be careful cause she can affect your grade.
dkcl9e,"YTA - Text the wife, sounds like she makes the plans. Also, they are under no obligation to provide quality time between you and their baby."
dkcpea,NTA. Your boyfriend is being purposefully lazy. No functioning adult does laundry without detergent unless they’re obtuse.
dkcppf,"YTA. Your current situation sucks, but it is a sperate event from the pictures of you gf and her ex. Imagine how shitty she has to feel to know those pictures of her are spreading around and she has no control over it. She is going through some really emotional truama right now too. Both of you should be there for the other in each other's respective situation."
dkcpsd,"ESH. You all sound like emotional children. Good on you for doing the chores for both her parents and yours. Bad on her for being a dick about it and bad on you for being a dick about where she ate. It’s all just so petty. Also, the next time you have to poop and someone wants you to do something say “Yes but I gotta go to the bathroom first”. It’s not that hard! Good grief you practically did it to yourself."
dkcs9b,"NAH, things are hard to schedule with a big group of adults, especially something like D&D which takes several hours. Maybe tell them as long as 4/6 (or whatever) people can join, you will be playing with or without full attendance. Might also be good to prepare a couple one shots for particularly difficult weeks? It's understandable to be frustrated, but you can only do so much."
dkcsam,NTA. Your girlfriend needs to learn to cope with the fact that you have a child with this woman and will be in each others lives due to that fact.
dkctk2,"NTA

She says nobody should say the n word but she’s saying it? Wtf?"
dkcton,What is this highschool musical?
dkd1xf,"NTA, and it’s time to sell that car."
dkd36i,NTA. You’re not obligated to continue a relationship with this man. Good on you for helping make sure your brother is in a good spot.
dkd5tn,"YTA. Games aren’t fun if you play like that unless /everyone/ is playing like that. 
Not everything has to be super competitive. 

You don’t have to lose on purpose or anything, but don’t go full scorched earth. An overly competitive winner is just as annoying  as a sore loser."
dkd90h,"NAH Sounds like this his first serious relationship (hasn't been an issue in the past 10+ years) and he's trying to ""share"" an important part of his life with you. You have no obligation to listen to someone drone on and on about their SO. Tread gently if you want to keep the friendship."
dkde6l,"NTA at all. You're just looking out for her and her business if you consider it that. Any rising business-woman or man should be concerned with their PR, especially when they have a finicky client base."
dkdf3l,She doesn’t need a job she has you... you are the golden goose
dkdgf1,"NTA

You guys are living there for free curtesy of your sister’s kindness. Your husband certainly needs to have more respect. Your sister let you guys stay there she didn’t say to throw parties."
dkdgoz,"NTA - As an adult you are free to socialize with or avoid whomever you want.

Pro Tip: Go to one more party and come out as a gay vegetarian atheist. You won't be invited back."
dkdn8k,NTA - you're in college and do not need to be at her beck and call.
dkdoub,"NTA. Next time tell them something like ""You must love the mind picture of me masturbating that you feel the need to recall it everytime you can"". If they cant respect you even when you told them to stop, they dont deserve you being there with them."
dkdozf,"YTA. Not your kid, and they're teaching her balanced, healthy habits.

You tried to give a FIVE year old a coke?? That's gross."
dkdrs8,"NAH in an almost wholesome way.

No fault for you wanting to continue the wedding tradition, and I can also see not wanting to share my birthday anymore than it already was."
dkdu57,"YTA. Over half the week is basically a 3rd roommate. If I was your roommate, I'd be asking to split the rent 3 ways."
dkdvww,YTA. Teach your kids everything possible while they are young. It’s much easier to pick up on as a child.
dkdx71,"ESH.
You can't just let people show up to no party. That would make it hard on the kids, but also YOU kid, as he would face backlash from the other kids due to their (and/or their parent's) disappointment. 


You've got to contact all non-RSVP parents, say party was cancelled due to no feedback. 

Then plan the smaller party. 

Next year state that RSVP is necessary as a room is being booked, and that non-RSVP kids need to be turned away as you need to prepay venue per kid (or something similar) and do the exact same process if not enough people RSVP."
dke1pm,"NAH - The kid was going to cry regardless. Namely because they had just something embarrassing in front of strangers and (probably) had no idea how to fix the situation. Your friend handled it exactly how I (as a educator) would have handled it. Something along the lines of ""Whoops! This happened - Oh well! Can I help you clean it up?"". And WHEN they cried I would have said ""Hey; It happens to everyone - it's happened to me a few times in my life too"" (even though it hasn't) and offered some tissues if I had them."
dke26e,NTA. Your mom is just awful for trying to make your sister’s depression your responsibility. I don’t think it’s going out on a limb to say the way your mother has handled your sister has contributed to her depression. Your sister is behaving like a spoiled brat.
dke5i0,"YTA - Not everyone enjoys things the same way. 

As for saving over your file. You seem to already understand it was an honnest mistake.

(Edit - If your mad that you saw the last cutscene there were multiple options you could have taken to avoid it. Ask him not to play it in front of you or dont be around him while hes playing.)"
dke6uv,"NTA holy shit, your mom is insane. Literally making a huge deal and smashing things because you didn't do things exactly as she wanted you to do them. If she's really that micromanaging all the time, I can't imagine having her as a parent."
dkeajh,NTA. You don’t have to continue a friendship with someone whose behavior you disagree with.
dkebvo,"ESH. While it would be lovely if your dad spent one on one time with you, it isn’t okay for you to demand that you don’t want a stranger sleeping in the house while you’re there. She isn’t a stranger and it isn’t your house to make rules for."
dkehx9,NTA . Think of it this way- what if it were the other way around? If she told you she was uncomfortable and you weren't hearing that- how would she respond?
dkek3s,NTA. Being a roommate doesn’t mean you have to be home so your roommate doesn’t have to sleep alone. That isn’t an expectation you place on someone you aren’t dating.
dkeovp,"This post was about whether or not you’re shitty for yelling at a kid with a developmental disorder. You said you had a wordcount issue, I’m pointing out you could have just cut that entire part out and leave off your pressing need to be judgmental next time.

Like let’s assume everything you say is true and Mel sucks, but how is that relevant to your story? We don’t need to know what a shitty person Mel is. It changes absolutely nothing about the topic we’re supposed to be arbitrating and just reads as you wanting people to focus on how shitty Mel is rather than whether or not *you* are the asshole. The topic isn’t really about a choice between you or Mel being THE Asshole, it’s whether you were the asshole for yelling, or Bonnie was the asshole for laughing at you and your yelling was justified. Obviously Mel is an asshole for scratching you, but you didn’t yell at Mel. You yelled at Bonnie."
dker86,YTA for manufacturing drama between your kids and for playing such blatant favorites.
dkerlm,"YTA

if your wife actively calls your daughter lazy in front of you, and won't let her eat before she finishes her schoolwork (which, by the way, is horrible) she's probably much worse when you're not around. and you refuse to listen to or believe your daughter. no fucking wonder she doesn't want to stay with you."
dkesn0,NTA. Biological ties do not obligate you to forgive someone who has treated you horribly.
dket7g,"NTA at all. You are being a responsible parent. 

Just because you're related to people doesn't mean you have to like them. 

Also: Your grandparents are reacting in a very typical behavior: deflecting blame and trying to invent lies to make someone else look bad, so they can hide their own guilt and shame. You are being smart by not inviting that into your life.

I suppose you could give them the chance to clean up so they can be part of your child's life, but I'm not sure how they'd prove their sobriety without you being the drug police, judge, and jury. 

I'm sorry you're in this shitty position."
dkeud3,"NTA. Does this guy seriously not realize that USING THE ELEVATOR is using electricity, regardless of who pushes the button??"
dkevzf,"ESH. It was rude for them all to cut in line, however, what did you gain from talking to children the way you did? You made yourself look like an asshole."
dkexgu,"NAH, crates are not inherently inhumane if used properly, but it is also not a method of getting rid of excess energy. You’re not an AH for mentioning it, but there is some misinformation in this conversation. Almost all pets are destructive to some degree and it is something that every new pet owner should expect."
dkexuu,"Yta. If someone else feels they have just cause to report him, that isn’t any of your business and it isn’t your place to try and talk them out of it. If you can’t be supportive, at least be decent and keep your opinion to yourself."
dkey60,"NTA, you're doing your best, they're not. 

I was first chair sax in highschool, I know how frustrating it is to have people in your section not even attempt at trying. You can do your best to help or encourage them, but at the end of the day it's on them when they fail."
dkez6n,"Life protip: dont be friends with people who block you during a disagreement and make statements like ""if you were a real friend you would do x""

NTA"
dkf48u,NTA. The bride is fully to blame for burning her dress.
dkf5qy,NTA -  the real asshole is the sister followed closely by the parents who “laid down rules” but won’t stand by them. Yay enablers.
dkfafg,"NAH. They probably won't be able to adopt. They might be able to get a foster kid and, if so, that foster kid will probably be happy they got to live in a happy home for as long as possible. Most young foster kids are on reunification plans, so they don't need long term foster families anyway."
dkfcf0,"So you have two options:

NTA: talk it over with your husband, be honest that the dog's needs are too much for you to handle personally and you guys need to work out a compromise. stand your ground but keep an open mind. maybe send it to someone who doesnt mind the hubby visiting it occasionally.

YTA: you get rid of the dog without his knowledge.  Its stressing you out too much and you were right before he got the thing."
dkfgct,NTA. Biological ties don’t obligated you to have a relationship with someone who makes you miserable.
dkfphc,"Person with autism here. You’re NTA. Granted, everyone with autism is different, and it may not be their fault, but if they’re ignoring your cues/don’t understand them, it’d be detrimental for both of you to continue the friendship. It’ll make you miserable, and they won’t be able to make new connections about social cues. It’s not that we can’t learn them, I myself took a social skills class. I personally HATED when people stayed my friend out of pity, because it was obvious and it hurt a lot. When you let those friends go and admit they don’t like you, it takes a lot off your shoulders. 

TL:DR NTA, stay civil but hopefully this will be a learning experience for them."
dkfpv7,"NTA it’s your special day that you’ve worked hard for and you want your mom to be a part of it. I think your feelings are completely justified. I would remind her that she said it was your choice and that you’re uncomfortable with the fact that this boyfriend is driving a wedge between you two. 

However, unfortunately if you really want her to be there and she can’t be reasoned with you might have to be the bigger person and just let him come."
dkftqn,"NTA. 

The reservation apparently didn’t pay attention in history class, or their teachers glossed over that whole Prohibition thing and how well that worked. And the closest liquor store was an hour away? Forget that."
dkfx51,NTA  He knew you were further away but didn't care or even tip you but wanted you to run back for a couple buck soda. What a jerk.
dkfx6m,"NTA . 
A service dog shouldn’t or considered as “just an animal”. A service dog is a tool (and friend) that helps keep people alive. For example, you can’t just not take insulin if you are diabetic just because “it is a hassle to use” and “you don’t want to worry about checking my blood”. Anyone that prevents medical tools from being used should be prosecuted, goodnight."
dkfxed,NTA - finding the other person physical appearance to be attractive to you is an important part of a relationship.
dkfzsq,"NTA

You sound like a responsible parent. You're the boss w your family, if he doesn't like it and chooses to stay home, that's solely on him. Best of luck."
dkfzz2,"NTA.  If they don't have permits, they don't get to park.  They can walk, carpool, or take cabs/Ubers."
dkg3zb,"NTA

You either need to pick her up or you don’t. She said you don’t."
dkg58r,"YTA because you're the parent. Yes you should oversee as much as you can because your kid is 13 not 18 and she took an expensive piece of equipment without asking. You need to teach your daughter to ask before taking other peoples things.

I know it must be exhausting having to actually parent a child, but that's what you sign up for when you reproduce."
dkg6z5,"NTA. As someone who used to struggle with a coke problem I can tell you that although he may not intend to go out and break his promises, there is a very real chance he will give into peer pressure and do it anyway. I don’t think you’re an asshole for not trusting him, as I’d probably do the same thing. However, if he is lying to you it might be that he’s ashamed and wants to avoid upsetting you. If you’re still prepared to be patient and not let this hurt your relationship, Id say trying to be more supportive and seeing things from his point of view will help him open up to you better."
dkg7bu,NTA. She would stay at your place and then not talk to you again for 2 years until she is in town again. It also doesn’t sound like she’s the type to offer any sort of compensation. Not saying you’d have to accept but it’s still polite to offer.
dkg7fg,"NTA. But with this ""please refrain from rude remarks about my boyfriend"" shit, it's pretty obvious you don't want to hear what you already know: namely that your boyfriend is a sloppy aggressive drunk and needs to get his shit together."
dkgffe,"NAH, this sounds like your grandparents might need to feel useful to you, and are struggling with the fact they need *your* help, but you don't need theirs."
dkgisa,"NAH, it is okay to spent time with your friends without your partner, but I can also see why she is feeling left out, especially since sunday is the day you usually do stuff togethere. Maybe you should talk about it again and explain to her that you just want to have an all guys day, since you haven't seen them so long."
dkgjll,YTA for using all the letters that make this post ridiculously confusing.  Aunty gets a say in the funeral and if she's only willing to pay $500 then you have a $1500 (x3) funeral.  In all things in this world there is a budget for everything.
dkgtuk,YTA your wife didnt make you feel heartless you ARE heartless. Look I'm usually very sympathetic to pet owners and love my cats dearly but the way you are talking about this child is disgusting. Its a little kid they don't know any better and you're  calling this child disgusting brat and other things. YTA here for sure and not because you love your dog but because of the horrible dismissive and just terrible way you speak about this kid.
dkgxc8,"YTA for seemingly being oblivious to the basic fact if you drink a coffee you can't immediately piss it out on demand. Her going before you left would not have changed that. Also why are you treating her like a kid?

Edit: spelling"
dkh0h7,"NTA. Absolutely. This girl is being physically abused by your friend. In a situation like that, morality and right from wrong have to trump friendship."
dkh1pe,"You are entitled. Start your own student society, and apply for funds from the university once it gets going. That is how all student societies start out: like minded people get together and organize.  It is not your fault all other societies are evening drinkers, but it is not their fault you are not."
dkh3wv,"NTA: its your child but heres the thing, yes the game is rated for adults 18+ but heres the kicker. Your son and boyfriend were looking at it as a bonding experience. not going to try to justify cod (i think its fine but each kid is different on what their levels of maturity and understanding is) 

Look around to see if theres a different game the two can enjoy instead or wait until it comes out and rent it yourself and play through a bit to see if its something you can be a bit giving on."
dkh4ae,"That's a classic Judge Judy but I would say YTA, I have sympathy for you and sorry for the heart ache but it was your choice to invite her and you did not pre-agree to split the costs. 
Though if you still wanna go ahead and ask her for money, I guess you be socially acceptable asshole."
dkh4sb,"YTA. 

I would say ESH but the character of the guy isn’t really in question. He’s clearly an asshole but he also has zero moral conscience. 

You’re an asshole for not telling her. People can claim that it’s “not my relationship” and “I’m not the one cheating” but that’s just being a self-interested coward. You fucked up by willingly entering into an affair and you’re afraid you’re going to look bad when you tell the GF. 

That is the real reason people don’t admit to affairs, as far as I’m concerned. When they say “what she doesn’t know won’t hurt her”. Nope. She is already hurting by being in a relationship with a fraud. She just doesn’t know it yet. 

Grow a spine and tell the girl. Have proof. Screenshots etc. She deserves so much better than you and him. It’s the least you can do."
dkh77z,Of course YTA and now that person knows where you  park your car lol
dkhajs,"YTA, I’m sorry but who’s the adult in this situation? Why didn’t you go down in person and tell them to keep it down. And if they continued making the noise why didn’t you just tell her friends to leave?

Making the prank call was stupid and scared her; as her parent I don’t understand how you had your daughter in front of you scared shitless because of something you did and didn’t immediately apologise for making her so upset."
dkhb5o,"NTA ,- am dutch. It is not normal to tip like in the US. People get paid a decent wage, however the waiters in Amsterdam are often very rude.

The only tips I give are for example if I had a meal that costs 37 euro I will tell em to round it up to 40. 

But no there is absolutly no need to tip in the Netherlands and your waiter was a twat for acting that way."
dkhm9n,[deleted]
dkhmdq,"We have rules in place that would protect your choice not to damage yourself. The company could get in serious trouble for telling you to do something dangerous. 

NTA.

You even mentioned safer options. Your co worker is a lazy idiot. Darwin will take care of him sooner or later."
dkhsjm,"YTA, you made a huge assumption that your friends would put their dislike of religious services ahead of their wish to see you married. Sounds like you don’t think much of them."
dkhwsk,I think the doctor who diagnosed her and treated her had a lot more to do with saving her life than your mean ill intentioned comment. Your both assholes for insulting each other although her more than you because it sounds like you were provoked multiple times.
dki3gv,"NTA. What a weird hill for her to die on. You gave her plenty of alternate options, and made it very clear what the repercussions would be. She decided to be indignant."
dki8lq,Please say you're teenagers
dkiavo,NTA - closes means closed. I worked retail in HS and college and the number of people who don’t get that is annoyingly high. That they called and lied about it to your manager makes them the assholes.
dkie6k,"Probably NTA, but leaving the group chat seems like a slight overreaction."
dkihkr,"NTA.

I don't understand why people say you should talk to them if you are family. If you don't like her, and she is sexist and rude you have absolutely no obligation to associate with her, regardless of any biological connections."
dkiooo,NTA at all. I'd happily tell anyone to fuck off if they demanded I take my headphones out
dkiqdh,"Yes, of course YTA. Dads who yell at coaches about their kid's playing time are assholes. Let the coach do his job and back the fuck off."
dkir7f,NTA super unreasonable
dkj4xp,"You offered the biscuit right in front of the other guy? Yeah, that's kind of an asshole move."
dkj5ds,"NTA That's a health hazard. You say she's sentimental, but this doesn't sound okay. Is she a hoarder? That can be a serious problem. Is she in therapy?"
dkj5dq,"NTA  

But you need better communication with your mum.  I would suggest a joint counselling session so you can put you side across in a calm non accusing way and your mum can then get the support she needs to deal with her own emotional attachment issues. 

Is ok to want to branch out on your own, you are not your parents keeper.  You will also likely find that your relationship with your mum will get better when you no longer live together, as the daily grind and getting on each others nerves goes away."
dkj62e,NTA. She was just being dramatic and making a point.
dkj7k7,NTA Telling the truth is never an asshole move.  The truth also protects you from any slander or libel complaints.
dkjh3g,"NTA. Having been a kid in a messy divorce along with my brother and sister, I can understand where you are coming from and I think it's fair to not want to be your mum's confidant. Kids shouldn't have to be their parent's therapists."
dkjjsy,"NTA 

How are you able to be calm with them screeching.

Whether or not you owe them an apology depends on if you want to maintain those friendships. An apology from you would go a long way in smoothing things over (because: adults apologize), but if they don't apologize for being hysterical idiots, well.....

But we weren't there,  your bf heard you, and he thinks you should because he heard your tone and all, so.....

Definitely NTA though."
dkjndm,"NTA. Letting you win wouldn't necessarily make him TA, but saying ""it’s like a parent letting their child win"" is pretty patronising."
dkjocz,"NTA

Your dad made his bed, now he can lie in it. Without you and your son.

I also suggest that you never trust your sister to watch your son because I wouldn't put it past her to arrange a meeting behind your back."
dkjodn,"How cruel and unkind they are (including your husband!) to ask you to sacrifice your health for their convenience. This is not ok! 

Presumably they don’t bring their dogs everywhere else with them - what do they do for vacation, or when they have to be out of the house for several hours for other reasons? 

If they can’t afford a dog sitter to come and let the dogs out or visit with them, perhaps your husband (not you!) could be accommodating and offer to help them out by paying for it. It wouldn’t cost more than $25 to have someone pop over and check in on them. But under no circumstances should any of them be asking you to be miserable and unwell by having the dogs at your house.

But you clearly said you needed space from her before this trip, and while it’s good to meet your own emotions needs, it’s also always important to recognize the impact your actions have on others and their feelings. 

You both should have talked this out long before things got bad enough for her to cancel her tickets. I hope you can both learn from it and move on."

You didn't know until it was too late that the boys dad would cover the full cost of the car.

I’m almost 100% that clause isn’t legal so just FYI there. But this sub isn’t about legal questions.  It’s about morals. 


And morally, you are making a mountain out of a molehill. Unless your sister is regularly bringing home drug addicts and abusive assholes, there is no reason to assume random men are going to rob you. 

Most people don’t do that, especially when they come over to hook up. They have other things on their mind


Edit: this is also sexist, unless by guys you mean guests. Women could rob you just as easily. 


More importantly, Your sister isn’t staying with you as a guest. She signed a lease which I assume means she is paying rent.   That changes the equation/relationship dynamic.

First off, you are better off without your now ex. Jealousy is about some combination of insecurity, manipulation and control, attributes that make for bad relationships. 

You are in this mess, because you lied to avoid conflict. Though that is common when dealing with a jealous SO, as demonstrated by your break up, it never ends well. Learn from this. If you want healthy relationships in the future, confront the conflict in a reasonable way. 
  
e,g, “Yes, she’s considered attractive, but she’s a flat mate, not a love interest.” 

Or

“That’s a question is a trap and you know it. I either have to lie to avoid a fight now, but end up having one later, when the truth comes out, or I can tell the truth and your jealousy will rear its ugly head.”"

You would need to first call CPS on your parents and then make a guardian claim that you are the best guardian for your sibling. You’ll have to do home visits and a lot of paper work to get guardianship for your sibling. You will then have to go to court and most likely fight to get “child support” from your parents. You can then sign up for food stamps and other government programs to help you. Like I said, you can do this under the table but it will be financially and legally a lot harder especially when it come to school, doctors appointments etc. In the end it’s a lot of added work and responsibility so I do not fault you for not doing it."

dkp04o,"YTA - You’re definitely an asshole. It’s a HUGE step back in a relationship to live together and then not live together. The fact you’re doing this when she IS going through a hard time shows your priorities.

1. Narcissistic, given that she's blaming you for doing all this stuff, (bailing on plans, not coming out to stuff) when in fact she is the one doing it, not you. 

2. Hyper pessimistic, to the point she sees all of this going on and genuinely feels as though she's the backup, despite obvious evidence to the contrary.

dkpgxj,Yeah YTA. All she suggested was getting more help from someone because what you’ve tried isn’t working. She’s spot on in identifying that you’re losing your shit after being a stay at home parent for less than a month and blaming everything on her instead of troubleshooting together.
dkpkn7,NTA have your wedding where you want to have it. It's you and your fiance's big day not hers. If she wants to come she will. The fact that you offered to put her up and help pay for the flight should have been enough to end the issue completely. I'm sorry you and your fiance are going through that kind of drama.
dkpl57,NTA. He’s 23. You’re going above and beyond by offering to buy him clothes in the first place. I’m also 23 and out of my parents house. I buy things almost exclusively on clearance or at thrift stores. Your son needs to get over himself.

Clearly, you have a support system that works great for your family, which after only a year this new guy is not a part of. It’s okay that you guys have different needs, and you can stay together while you each fulfill them, but you don’t have to live together to be together.

dkr94a,"NTA.   However, I do have a few questions.   How often do you ask her to hang out?   Could be a case of both of you waiting for the other to ask to make plans.  Or maybe just flat out ask if something’s bothering her because you’ve noticed you don’t spend a lot of time with each other.    After that, then yah I would say move on.  It’s hard but I’ve had this happen with a few friends.    You both grow and change as people and it’s possible you guys are just growing in two opposite directions.   Honestly myself, I’ve caught up with a few friends from highschool, and I could never see myself hanging out with them on a regular basis now because we are at two completely points in our lives. 

Last thing, it does still hurt when people just sort of ditch you.  But let’s just hope it’s not that and there’s some other explanation."

I do feel like you shouldn't have had the mattress down if you weren't sleeping on it though because that's taking up space on the floor for no reason. Is there some reason you didn't have it directly under your bed?"
dkrmzp,"NTA - She doesn’t go through your stuff but USES your stuff... that is quite a hypocritical outlook. No, you’re definitely not an asshole. I’d be quite annoyed if she were using my things, I would absolutely cut that off. There is no reason for her doing that. And if she’s pissed your dog is eating her dirty containers, why can’t she just shut her door? I mean, a better solution would be to clean it, but that would be too easy."

I know it was very difficult to see her so sickly, but instead of crying or just enjoying the time with her, my family made jokes about how I wasnt graduating on time, and how my (now Ex-girlfriend) wasn't a supermodel.
And when I confronted them about me just wanted to have one last Easter I was told 

""Go cry a river"""
dks095,NTA you paid the $25 in league dues so you are free to manage (or in your case not manage) your team however you want. If they have a problem with the way you run it (which I can understand since you haven't actually be running it) that stinks but the correct thing to do is to just not invite you back next year instead of booting you mid season. Unless there was some agreed upon clause about forfiting your team by not managing it somewhere in the rules you aren't wrong for wanting your money back. Unfortunately if the other people in your league are in on it there isn't really much you can do...

dks57q,"NTA for wanting to get some sleep, but it sounds like you should make a queen bed a priority purchase. It's a little worrisome that he's trying to put all the blame on you, but let's not jump to conclusions. He may be more reasonable after you've both had another night to calm down."
dks5kv,Get a 15 dollar meal and tip that 5 dollars instead. If you cannot go out to eat. Don’t go out to eat. Going with YTA. But only slightly as I get you’re in a tight spot. But if you can’t afford the tip. You can’t afford to eat out. Anyone who says otherwise is scum tbh.
dks6v2,"If the two of you have previously discussed sharing food, and he has stated he is unwilling to do so, then you are NTA for letting him know he either needs to 1) replace the items or 2) give you money to replace the items, as he himself imposed to “no communal food” rule."
dks8jb,"You paid it.

No harm, no foul.

It's not like you got one and failed to pay it/let it go delinquent. 

Good Job for you, OP."
dks8jw,"NTA - He's putting those remarks out to the public, have at it."
dksahy,"NTA. He's a tourist. As someone who was not born in France, and has never been to France, he cannot claim to be of french nationality. He is of French heritage, but he himself is not French. Does he speak French? Does he know French culture? Can he vote in France? Can he go to school in France? If the answer to any of these things is no, he is not French.   


In fact, this specific brand of tourism is called ""heritage tourism."" You could argue that it is more respectful than other forms of tourism, because heritage tourists take an interest in discovering the culture and history of an area, but they are tourists all the same. And what he's doing now, adjusting his life to be more ""French"" after his touring in France, shows that he's delusional."
dksfan,"This sounds like a shitpost. On the off chance you’re for real, grow up. YTA. This experience would be so much more valuable than whatever stupid plastic crap you were planning to show off to your friends and then throw away in a few years.

Added: “I got a fucking trip to Mexico for Christmas” is a hell of a brag in my opinion. I understand about the fear you will be bored. Resorts that allow families usually have included activities specifically for kids and teens. If not, your parents are choosing the wrong place."
dksjdg,"NTA. It’s super simple. If the camera were in his bedroom where it would never record anyone else, I could see maybe it being okay. Since it records common spaces like the living room, NTA and I’d probably go further than only unplugging the cameras when he’s not home tbh"
dksmon,"NTA- You said it yourself. You helped him greatly along, by doing the stuff a good older brother does for their younger siblings. You spent much of your own money on other things (such as food, which I'm guessing he hasn't repaid??). You paid for a majority of the laptop that he used to get his game development career started. You sacrificed time on the laptop, which is yours, in order for him to hone his skills and improve on his money maker. Its damaged now (probably mainly because of him, seeing as it was used a majority of the time by him). Now he made $9k in one month largely because of your sacrifices using your computer and just you all around being an awesome supportive guy. Tell him that he doesn't have to buy you a $1000 laptop like his, but at least pay back part of the $550 ""investment"" that you made into his budding career so that you can hopefully replace the laptop with a new model."
dksn78,"NTA. Why do you always have to do for his family and never for you two as a unit? He's only going to be in the middle of fighting if he allows himself to be. He tells them this year he's not going to family Christmas, he's having it with his spouse, and any fits will result in those people being put on No Contact. 

For whatever it's worth, I tell people Christmas is for family--mine. We don't drag our kids everywhere for holidays, the time belongs to us."

Have you considered that you are indeed the person they think you are, and that for one reason or another they don't like that? I dunno, maybe they're racist or maybe they hate the kind of job you have or maybe your haircut reminds them of your girlfriend's dad's most hated boss.

I think she should probably tell you anyway, but there's a lot of room here for her to be stuck in a very awkward position between parents she presumably loves and you."

dktnhb,"YTA a bit

She told you at the start that she only had 14 bucks and that her father didn't gave her any money, you made an assumption that he would pay you back. Unless your cousin told you that specifically then I don't think she was trying to deceive you, probably thought you were gifting her."

dktsjz,"YTA. You are being immature, and honestly I don't think you are ready to date someone who has been through this kind of trauma. He *will always love her*. You need to figure out how to be okay with that, or you need to leave him alone, because it is a hard thing to handle and doesn't need someone asking him to remove important parts of his grief process from his life.

Moreover, she is NOT his ex. They did not break up. She is his *late* girlfriend.

You are jealous, which is a fine thing to feel, but you can't act on that jealousy in a way that is going to hurt him. That is not a caring way to treat your boyfriend. Adding your picture to his wallet too is honestly a good compromise, and it shows that he is willing to make you a part of his life, but she will always be part of his life too."
dktx0v,"NTA. Your hiring/scheduling department is to blame, not you."
dku1zc,Nta. Dude this is a prior commitment.  Your group relies on you. Its okay not to go to a party. This is just as important.  Shes kinda a jerk for telling you otherwise.

dkucj6,"NTA. I feel like this is a ""give an inch, they take a mile"" situation. Backstory aside, when it comes to rental properties and the landlord not living in the immediate area, I feel it could easily fall on you guys to begin to handle the day to day dealings with the rental property. This based on the fact that she has asked several times and maybe about different issues with the place, that she hopefully got fixed after asking you."
dkuln9,"YTA - I get where you are coming from, not being a religious person myself, and I am not here maliciously thinking YTA, but at the end of the day he is your child and it is still your responsibility to share parental duties. This includes taking him to things he is participating in when your wife can’t. 

Your son deserves to get to explore religion and make a decision for himself, and he can’t do that if he isn’t given the opportunity to. You not being willing to let him do this is going to give him the impression he shouldn’t, which means that you’re influencing him instead of letting him make that choice for himself like you say you want him to. 

If you’d like a suggestion, I’d say sit down with your wife and discuss additional ways to let your son explore faith. If he decides he doesn’t want to go to those classes anymore, let him know he doesn’t have to. Let him know that if he doesn’t want to follow religion, that’s alright too. Maybe get him a book or help him research other religions so he knows he has other options if he ever wants them. When I was a kid I wanted to explore other religions and faiths and my catholic dad was super against it, so it took me until I was an adult to be able to do that.

Religion isn’t as black and white as “yes I believe” and “no I don’t believe”. If you want him to grow to independently make his own choice on this, then you have to participate in making him feel comfortable doing so."

>she agrees to leave her bed since she cannot sell it and says **I can have the bed we can work out a deal later**. 

You staying silent after your friend said that implies you agreed. Your friend basically sold you the bed on credit. If you disagreed, you should have said something at the time. You can't unilaterally decide the bed is free 3 months later.

Your friend sucks for doing this, especially after all the money you saved her in the past. But all those favors were basically gifts (unless you said at the time you'd charge her). Gifts are free. 

Your friend sucks more though. Charging you money for something she wouldn't be able to sell anyway? Who's gonna buy a used bed in bed-bug central NYC?"

You are a separate adult with a separate financial situation and she took money from you without your permission.

dkw63y,"Edit : NTA (previously Y-T-A (tiny bit)) 

I've been an atheist for as long as I can remember and I participate fully in all rituals with my Hindu/Buddhist family as long as it isn't too toxic. I've also gone to church and mosque and when asked to pray do some silent self-meditation.

This is not just your family's religion, it's their *culture* and it's your culture as well. Your lack of belief doesn't need to include rejecting your family's rituals if they aren't causing harm. Funeral rites are a way for loved ones to gather and celebrate the person who has passed away. It brings people together. I would suggest you participate but instead of thinking of everything as meaningless, give each ritual your *own* meaning in private. Let each incense stick you light represent a good memory with your father, for instance.

Death is hard and complicated to deal with. Don't push away your loved ones unnecessarily, they are there to support you.

Edit: Having read your updates, clearly you are doing nothing wrong! You've done as much as you can and your relatives are pushing you to do something that would be distasteful to any person, let alone someone who is grieving! I'm glad your mom is backing you up here.

This is typical sociopathic and abusive behaviour by ypur sister. Gaslighting, not fullfilling promises making seemingly small demands all the time and calling you out when you aren't meeting them is grade A manipulative behaviour.

Also attacking you and putting your child at risk and THEN spreading lies about your husband is enough for anyone to distrust this person for a looong time. 

 It's always difficult not to take these posts with a grain of salt but even if only half of this is moderately accurate I'd say you're totally in the right.

dkye80,"NAH. it’s impossible to be sure why exactly she can’t afford the fancier events. Maybe she has things coming up on the horizon that’s she’s concerned about. On the other side, you’re allowed to feel disappointed.

He dragged her away from the party and isolated her, prevented her from leaving while he harassed her and demanded she forgive an abuser because *he wanted her to*. Susie was looking down, nodding and not speaking **because she was afraid of him**. She was trying to de-escalate and get out of a dangerous situation with overbearing angry drunk man who dragged her off from the party and was yelling at her about something that was none of his fucking business.

This really isn't your call. Your wife is the one delivering a human being, and she wants the support of someone who has been through it.

>I'm of the opinion that this is one of those bonding moments for us and us alone since we are the ones directly involved in this event. 

I hate to break it to you, but you're not ""directly involved."" You're indirectly involved. You're there to support your wife and, yes, to witness the birth of your child.

-I'm **not saying the father is not involved in the birth of the child.** I'm saying they're not **directly** involved, which simply means they're not the one doing the actual thing. If he's not there, the delivery still goes ahead. That doesn't mean he's not a valued and important part of the process.

-I understand that in most cases the father **is directly involved in the conception.** We're talking about the delivery here, not the conception. If OP's wife wanted her mother present for the conception, my judgment would absolutely be NTA in favour of OP.

-I don't know what ""toxic femininity"" is, and I've never been diagnosed with it. There are corners of Reddit where this term may be used regularly, but those are not places I go. (Edit #2: No thanks, I don't want to Google it).

-I don't ""hate men,"" I think they're awesome.

And finally to the people wishing death on me and any future children, or calling me an asshole, a jerk, a douche, or any variation of a ""cussing cuss,"" and yes, also to the person who called OP a ""cussing cusshead who has no cussing idea what it's like to cuss a tiny human cuss out of your cuss,"" that's not what this sub is about. I know we see politicians debating worthwhile issues with ad hominem attacks all the time, and it's easy to forget there's another way, but there is another way. This sub should be, and can be, a shining example of everybody getting along, especially when what we're discussing is basically two nice people who appear to love each other and their baby. It's possible to debate even really divisive issues without resorting to personal insults. Let's do that!"
dl15gg,"YTA. Your wife ""confessed"" that she had children when you decided to move in together?  

> thing what did not bother me if they are well behaved

News flash buddy, when you marry someone with kids, they become your kids. You have to be as enthused about being a father to them, as you are about the marriage. This isn't your wife's burden, it's yours too."
dl15u3,"NTA.

Cutting off family who treat you like you don't even matter does not make you AH."
dl187j,NTA. First it's not your job to cover for her. It's her job to let you know where everything is and if someone is coming in. If she got in trouble that's on her not you.
dl18my,"YTA

The f-word is hate speech.

> just because I'm an r/unpopularopinion kinda guy who tells things straight.

This is what people who behave like assholes always say to justify their assholery. If you don't learn to employ tact, you are going to end up in a lot of these kinds of situations and wonder why people always seem to be pissed off at you. Hint: it's because you're rude and antagonistic, not because every single other person in the world is a sensitive snowflake."
dl18u5,NTA - Nothing wrong with getting tested or taking doctor recommended medication.
dl18x7,I’m not going to call you an asshole Bc depression/ anxiety can be a hell of a thing. I will say that she is entitled to feel that way. She’s sick of hearing you complain day in and day out with no action. Start making changes/get a therapist and work on yourself. You’ll feel a lot better and you’d be doing it to better your life quality.
dl19hd,"YTA. Why on earth were you so rude? When someone says ""excuse me,"" it's polite to respond. How do people expect the world to be a better place if they're not willing to put in the smallest effort to make it so?"
dl1lgz,NTA Even in Germany this Haircut is not unusual and we know one or two things about Nazis.
dl1p0l,"NTA. Your money, your property, and totally valid reasons for not wanting your brother to touch your stuff.

Your parents should buy your brother his own controller."
dl1row,"YWNBTA.

However, be very careful about this and make clear that this is information only, not criticism or a push to break up. Tell him that he can act on it however he wants and you'll still be friends and have his back. (this may be important for when he gets away)

Also, be aware that it's possible he'll tell her and she'll try to cut you out."
dl1uof,NTA for calling out how stupid it is to post any kind of illegal activity. You would be the biggest asshole if you filed a police report - weed is not that big of a deal and you would ruin both their lives doing that.
dl1va3,"NTA

You warned, ffs. You warned them *multiple times*. Have they at least learnt their lesson?"
dl220j,"NTA - try to spin it as a privacy thing. ""Oh, I'd love to talk to you at the office, but I'm afraid discussing your medical conditions in public is a HIPAA violation! Even if you're comfortable talking here, people overhearing the conversation might not feel the same way.""

Or even a simple ""I really wish I could talk right now, but I'm on a tight schedule today. So nice to see you!"" as you walk away."
dl24j9,"ESH

Keep your kinks to yourselves, people. He shouldn't have told yours, but don't go being petty and correcting it. Who cares?"
dl259p,Either your family is batshit crazy or you're not giving us the whole story.
dl25yc,"NTA, but your anger is displaced. Your father is the one who threw the kitten out, not your brother. I doubt your brother could have stopped your father from doing it.

And please, please, never bring another animal around your father. He is a piece of shit for throwing a helpless kitten out."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
dl2aqg,"NTA. What does he do if you're not home? He can easily add the key to his car keys and then he won't forget it. He needs to take responsibility over this and let himself into the house like a grown up and stop depending on you. If he cant atleast do that then he can walk around to the front. Also, get a curtain. It should be light enough that it won't disturb the books but can prevent people from seeing into the room."
dl2bbr,"NTA. Cooking stinky stuff is something you have to put up with with housemates. Them burning the house down is not. 

If they're that insistent on cooking food at that hour, ask them to use the microwave or meals that don't require cooking (pot noodles etc)."
dl2bd8,"Eh, I’m going with NAH

I don’t consider pronouncing things the way they are in foreign languages or with accents “appropriation”. It just sounds weird coming from someone with a bilingual background.

Your girlfriend has a point though, it can sound a bit pretentious. This isn’t a hill you want to die on."
dl2elt,"ESH. I know you agreed this, but you can't be angry with her for not having the money when you don't either. It's very hypocritical. 

You should agree to both have the money at the end of the month and hope you can book a nice place."
dl2eo8,"NTA because she bailed on short notice. You probably should have discussed it at the time though. Also, her income probably shouldn't factor in at all."
dl2foh,"NTA I would prefer to have my family pick me up, but you went above and beyond and he should be more grateful."
dl2gc5,"NTA because it sounds like you are avoiding something toxic, but saying I don't handle stress well is never a good excuse for anything. You should be working on how you handle stress, not just accepting it."
dl2p4m,"ESH. ""We all had to have a family sunday roast at Amy's house."" You are, presumably, an adult. So no, you didn't have to do anything, you chose to be a guest at her house. Regardless of whether you feel she has been rude to you when you've hosted, it doesn't make it right for you to 1) turn your nose up at the food your host is preparing, and 2) make a show of eating something that you like better. And yes, bringing a full dining set and whole chicken to a vegan's house is pretty theatrical."
dl2stx, NTA. People should be on time. The bus doesn’t wait. The train doesn’t wait. The plane doesn’t wait.
dl2uow,"NTA, sounds like a scam to me. Surprised you spent that much time w him. At the tears I would have walked."
dl2uxh,"YTA.  It is rude to pick up the phone to have a conversation when hanging out with a friend.  (Not rude: picking up to confirm an appointment or something else quick or urgent).  

Also telling her if she just hangs back she will meet someone is bullshit.  Yes, that happens to some people but for the most part finding a life partner that suits you well is going to be a lot of work.  Telling her to work on herself sounds like telling her no one would want her right now so she needs to improve.  I would be offended by that too."
dl2vfr,"NTA

Parents get to make decisions on how baby pictures are shared on social media. It's for the baby's privacy and protection. 

Aunt is TA for not asking before posting and for getting so pissed when you asked her to take it down."
dl2zfm,"He made a lame dad joke - but it wasn't really rude per se. There was no reason for you to interject. 

Your comment was lame and unfunny -- I can also picture you thinking that you were a total hero for saying it -- which annoys me further.

YTA"
dl305d,"She should def leave the home how you found it, does she work for a legit company? Or did you find her on like her own personal ad for pet sitting?"
dl30yf,"don’t joke about those things. if this woman has it out for you, don’t give her shit that she can complain to the manager about. find other more subtle ways to annoy her that can’t get you fired. 

nta."
dl31iw,[deleted]
dl34hb,NTA I never understood why men refuse to wear pants and belts that fit properly. Its not hard.
dl35kx,"NTA, allowing a 3 year old to have a pacifier does not mean he will become a drug addict. You are doing what you can and you will make the decision with your partner when to cut off the pacifier. Sounds like your SIL is a little ""holier than thou"" and her husband should talk to her about passing judgement when she likely has little to no idea of what she's talking about. Does your SIL have a background in early childhood development? If not, then she should keep her opinions to herself and shit talk you to her husband behind closed doors like normal nosy Nancy."
dl35n0,"NAH. If he want to spend his money without knowing where it’s going, that’s on him. You aren’t being an asshole because you know everyone isn’t honest and truthful in those situations and you’d rather know where your charity is going. Although if your friend makes you miss a train because of it again I’d say they’re an asshole."
dl3795,"YTA, yes you should have asked. You don't get to eat someone else's food just because you're annoyed that they are there. Why would you expect them to pay for crashing on their buddy's couch? Also rude to call them frat wannabes when they sound like they were cool to you."
dl3dx4,"NTA

No, painting your face like a bear is not blackface.  My god people, lighten up."
dl3fu3,NAH but if you think you should do more than yeah you should probably try at least
dl3ga1,"NTA. Holy shit this is a lot to unpack.

I think beyond your brother having a relationship with an old teacher of yours, this “tom” guy seems pretty awful otherwise. This is your day and it should be about you. You don’t need to be uncomfortable at your own wedding."
dl3hwq,"0.o

Let me get this straight.

Emily agrees to talk with you. Then, after 30 minutes, brings Mike on the call. Then, ditches the call to talk to John. After talking with Mike, you ask Emily if she's still talking to John, so you can talk with her. When she doesn't give you a clear answer, you hang up and haven't tried to talk to her since.

NTA

She apparently doesn't want to talk to you as much as you want to talk to her. You're not wrong putting distance between you. Wait a few days and reach out. Her response will tell you if she's interested or not."
dl3i2a,YTA for acting like being bi means you couldn't possibly have said something homophobic. Seems like if you knew what you said was fine you'd share it here for judgement.
dl3mn5,"> My mom was understandably upset and said I was her priority since she never gets to see me, but that she couldn't tell my sister not to bring him. 

your mom doesn't know what ""priority"" means.

NTA , the only power you have here is your presence.  Providing an audience is as much a tacit support of his douchebaggery as your parents not doing anything to shut him down."
dl3plb,"NTA. She could have said ‘you’ve got a letter, looks like it’s from the hospital, do you want me to open it?’ and then you’d have had the option as to whether or not you wanted her to."
dl3q70,"ESH. You're both acting like children. Her for not being supportive of your hobbies, you for having a temper tantrum. Why does she control all of the finances? Why is it not a mutual effort?"
dl3r9r,"ESH. Your comments were needlessly cruel and hurtful and seem mostly based on the fact that you don't approve of the fact that your sister really isn't into kids. I understand you would like her to be as dazzled by your son as you, but not everyone is a kid person and that's ok. Your sister has also not decorated herself in glory with her comments to you and the fact she can't acknowledge that, of course, you (as Mum), you are proud of your son. It's also ok for you to see your child as a major point in your life to be proud of. 

I think you should apologise to each other but, regardless of what she does, you definitely owe her an apology if you want to preserve a relationship with her. And understand that your son/any future children don't need to be a a high priority for her and it's ok that she values other achievements in life above childbirth/raising kids (but also totally ok that you do). Vive le difference, OP."
dl3rek,"NTA - He's not contributing and not making an effort to. Him finding a place to live is not your responsibility, it's his. Just give him a heads up that he's not coming with you guys as a courtesy"
dl3rk3,ESH.  Seriously what the heck is wrong with both of you?
dl3yju,"NTA you are actively paying for your family to use your car- He asked you to pay him back FOR THE GAS HE USED?!?

Your family do not deserve to use your property. Hide the keys and stick to your guns-you are 100% in the right here"
dl41pr,NTA. You do you. You can say happy birthday without ruining the surprise and without spoiling the 'you thought we forgot' element. Just don't tell anyone that's what you're doing and you'll be fine.
dl445g,"NTA since your fiance agrees with you.

If he wanted it on the east coast, then you'd have to work it out, if he's fine with Ontario, you're good."
dl46qt,"Yeah I mean YTA pretty obviously, I'm glad to hear it worked out for him eventually but you should have told him what happened."
dl485x,[deleted]
dl4als,"YTA

You can brush your teeth again,  you know. It's not a once-a-day limit."
dl4c1k,"NTA, tell the boy who short changed his daughter's education to stand up and be a man"
dl4cej,"NAH if you don’t go because you aren’t close and it costs $400.

YTA if you don’t go because she isn’t letting you bring a random guest."
dl4ekm,[deleted]
dl4fc4,YTA.  Opening a business is a risk but it also has its rewards.  Your GF is 30 and has a degree in business management.  This is a great time for her to give her own business a shot.  Not supporting her is an AH move.
dl4fc7,[deleted]
dl4hu0,"YTA - you're teaching your nephew to hide things from his mother. If she prefers that he doesn't eat fast food you should respect that, not encourage lying. And if you *really* thought it was an issue you could have spoken to her about it like an adult"
dl4i4r,"NAH but the buffet runners HATE it when people do this because it essentially fucks up the rest of the dish and when I worked in a a buffet we once had to throw out two entire trays of food because someone picked out all of one ingredient which was supposed to be the main deal (think of it like taking all the chicken out of the chicken stir fry so all that’s left is a shitty veggie stir fry that the entire thing is thrown away.)

So youre potentially wasting a LOT of food but neither you nor I would know for sure because neither of us work at those buffets."
dl4i7n,"Eh, yta. Just make some plans your friend can join and that are safer for everyone involved."
dl4iwm,"NTA

But, I’d make sure there were reasons other than getting away from them and avoiding them that you’re transferring. College is a big decision. 

I also wouldn’t ‘cut’ contact. Just don’t call them first. If they call you, try to be civil. Your brother will hopefully grow up to be less of an ass.  Moving away is a great way to limit contact without cutting them completely."
dl4k6s,NTA - she isn't entitled to having a bite of your half-burger lol
dl4pgz,"ESH

He sounds like an asshole.  Then again; so do you."
dl4ro5,"Gentle YTA. You need to deal with the real issue, which is your feelings of inadequacy in comparison to this friend. Asking them to change their name is only going to put a bandaid on an issue."
dl4u7z,YTA - Because you had the chance to have this out with your friend and haven't. Maybe try contacting them! Do it now!
dl539a,YTA. Making a flip remark like “when are you going to divorce him already” isn’t being supportive.
dl56qf,"YTA. Don't get me wrong, you don't have to go to a party if you don't want to, but your friends miss you and the only reason you're not going to hang out with them is because you can't be bothered to figure out a low-effort costume. The message to your friends is, ""yeah, I like hanging out with you until I have to put in effort or do something I'm not excited about."" Even if that's not totally true, I suspect that's how you're coming across. 

Not sure if you'd dress up as a male or female character, but here are some low effort ideas off the top of my head:

\- tape some white paper circles on a pair of glasses and go as a painting from [Big Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Eyes)

\- Wear blue and say you're Violet Beauregard from [Charlie and the Chocolate Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_(film)). Stuff a pillow under your shirt and you're blueberry Violet.

\- Wear black pants with a black shirt and say you're [Pierce Brosnan](http://www.horrordvds.com/reviews/a-m/marsattacks/marsattacks_shot9l.jpg) from Mars Attacks!. Bonus points if you find a pipe. Or plaid shirt + band shirt + jeans and you're Lucas Haas.

\- Khakis, glasses, black and white plaid shirt--Adam from [Beetlejuice](https://www.therpf.com/forums/attachments/tumblr_o3hk1edzmb1qjouuqo10_1280-jpg.844862/)."
dl575a,"NTA

I would have said N-A-H because of his sister visiting. Timing sucks, though he could have visited a bit at the house. However, his comments about her being dead for 10 years and that you're spoiled walked him right into AH territory. Not cool. And not a nice partner either."
dl57zx,"NTA 
And apparently your brother has decided he no longer wants Netflix access either"
dl58q2,"YTA

Obviously you were 15 once and you know how it is. I honestly wouldn’t have survived this long if I was constantly tracked at that age. Give your Son some privacy’s, the same privacy you expected at age 15."
dl59bv,NTA if you do it in a mature manner. Nothing wrong with telling them to please park a little closer to the edge. Just don't drop any F-bombs or any bad language.
dl5byv,"NTA: I would have said no assholes, but her lack of communication with you sort of ruins that.

I LARP as well, and those major events are time and cost consuming... She should have been more direct if this was going to be an issue for her."
dl5dms,"NAH

HOWEVER; don’t approach this yourself, go through HR. Tell them you exactly as you’ve said here"
dl5g6f,"Rookie mistake


YTA"

dl5mr1,NTA. Your parents owe you proper medical care and the ability to decide that an activity is no longer suited to you.
dl5opq,"YTA - sometimes you have to just let your friends do what they are going to do. You can try to warm them, but at the end of the day it’s his choices and if his choices keep him from going to college then that’s his own fault."
dl5ou9,"YTA. They didn’t know he was coming I’m, and you react by being on the defense about how your relationship is worth the same. It sucks to get a gift from someone who doesn’t want to give a gift, you’re forcing the issue. You had no reason to be on the defense."
dl5ox5,"YTA: My brother used to uber, and they get penalized for low ratings like this. It genuinely affects their business. You can write comments, and the driver will get the comments.

If the ride was fine, but you didn't enjoy the radio, then comment on the RIDE (3 star rating), and why you gave them 3 stars.

1 star could really hurt them."
dl5qdm,[deleted]
dl5qds,"YTA just for this post. It's written as if you're intoxicated now, and not ""half a joint"" high. Your wife has 3 kids, I'm sure she's sick of looking after a 4th (you)."
dl5sj4,"NTA. I’m the same way with my wife and dog hair/grass. She needs to be considerate of your space, and hopefully you guys are close enough to have that discussion and set fair expectations of each other and hold each other accountable."
dl5u1r,Is everyone in this story 12?
dl5u3o,"YTA

You've got to face reality. After a certain age, people just don't care about birthdays as much. You can't force your values on others. If you want your birthday to be special, then you make it that way. Don't sit around expecting people to do it for you."
dl5ur3,"NTA, he promised and is now going back on it. You sure you want to be with someone who does this?"
dl5xrc,"NTA

Superstitions are for suckers. Professional gamblers don't worry about being a coward. They think the way you do."
dl5y2j,NTA. Your mother has turned into a terrible tenant. You’re well within your right to tell her she’s lived with you long enough and it’s time for her to go.
dl611s,"NTA. You already agreed to arrangements with your coworker, so you thought you knew what weekend you’d have off. So you booked according to what you thought was the plan. She can’t expect you to switch your flights along with their vacation that you planned after the first agreement. But I also don’t think they are the asshole either because from what you’ve written, it doesn’t necessarily seem like they’re expecting you to. It’s more like they’re just asking if it’s possible. I honestly think that the repercussions with your family for changing the dates would be more problematic than the repercussions with your coworker should you not change."
dl61c7,"NTA. You’re entitled to feel however you feel about this. What your dad did sucks, no question. But his failure to be a good husband doesn’t mean he failed to be a good father."
dl62tu,"NTA 

He should be wearing headphones. That’s standard form etiquette. 

Tell him he needs to wear them when you are home and if he doesn’t you will be talking to the RA"
dl66n3,"NTA.  If there was no way to tell who was at fault, you are absolutely not obligated to provide info.  And what responsible dog owner leaves a dog park to sit in his car while his dog is playing?  He is not in any position to point fingers,"
dl693a,"NTA.

That said, if you want to have your mom involved in your kids' lives and at your wedding, I think you're doing yourself a disservice by keeping your relationship hidden.  I agree your dad is a separate issue, but think about it from your mom's point of view.  She doesn't know you have a 5 year relationship.  If you don't tell her and get married in 2 years, she won't know that it will have been a 7 year relationship.  To her, you'll have just sprung this entire wedding thing out of nowhere.  If you tell her now, you might lose her.  *Or* you might be giving her time and motivation to come around.  I mean, it's a lot harder to say you don't want to be involved with abstract hypothetical grandbabies than it is real future grandbabies, if that makes sense.  

If you live close, maybe she would even be willing to do some family counseling with you and your partner?  Having a neutral 3rd party can be really helpful."
dl6954,"This woman has a massive victim complex, holy christ. How does anyone put up with her nonsense? PTSD? Really???

dl6djx,"NTA. For the love all things holy, tell her the truth. Your friends are idiots."
dl6dqq,"NAH: She misses her children, and this is reasonable. It sounds like you two are older teenagers possibly, and may be leaving home over the next few years to move on with your lives. She is just trying to make the time count now that there is an opportunity to do so.

You say you're declining every 1 or 2 days. That's a lot of nos. I'm not saying you need to spend two hours every day with her, but what about making time at dinner? What about asking her to play video games with you? What about asking her to watch a show that YOU want to watch?

I'm willing to bet she'll do what you two want to do, if you just give her the idea or suggestion. She just wants to spend time with you guys, and that's not unreasonable.

How many hours a day are you two just hanging around playing video games anyway? If it's several, then 2 hours isn't that unreasonable."
dl6ghn,"NTA

She has been a bad friend to you. There is no reason to keep hurting yourself by trying to be her friend."
dl6ip2,[deleted]
dl6j1c,"NTA. If your family members are that concerned, they are free to offer their own money and time."
dl6qc2,"NAH. He’s not wrong for asking, but you don’t have to loan your personal belongings if you’re not comfortable doing so."
dl6qz2,"NAH. 

Kiddos get sick. He is going to be in a loving, familiar environment. Go honor your dad. ❤️"
dl6sjv,Yta - it is fine to move the stuff but you at least should have told her first or given her the opportunity to reorganize it. It sucks that its cluttered but when you agree to ket people use your home or space that's one of the things you have to anticipate
dl6t74,"NTA - and if you guys are a serious couple, these early misconceptions can make for an awkward MIL/DIL relationship. If you aren't a serious couple, then don't worry about her. He's still a bit of an ass for allowing someone that he is close to to form an inaccurate picture of you."
dl6th5,NTA I have no tolerance for people who spew hate towards others based on religion. I would definitely report him or confront him and tell him that he can have his opinion but not to vocalize it with you.
dl6vb1,"NTA. If you can’t tell your girlfriend that she’s hurt you, you don’t have much of a relationship."
dl6zob,NTA. It doesn’t sound like this woman has changed her ways at all. She deserves to be reported for the way she treated you and your husband while meeting with you.
dl701j,"YTA. She wants to meet with you and your wife to make sure it's clear she's not there to hook up with you. As for the rest of it, get over yourself. She's a friend, not the love of your life. No one is obligated to attend your wedding, especially when they have to shell out for plane tickets. She has other people in her life who are more important to her than you are. I don't know why that's so shocking to you, but it's a you issue that you need to deal with."
dl70hd,Steamy drama man. YTA. Are you her ex or not? If so then its not exactally big news that she slept with you before they were together.
dl70zm,"NTA  


We aren't talking 50 cents. We are talking a difference of $1.5 per delivery. Assuming two a day (which is being extremely conservative), we are talking almos $100 per month."
dl72mr,"NAH. Sounds to me like he just wants to spend time with you doing something you both enjoy, but has become overbearing. Try finding some other things you both enjoy so you're no getting burnt out. Doing something you like so often will just make it a chore rather than a fun occassion."
dl733u,NTA but did you say this was college or middle school?

dl7laa,"YTA dude, it's fine to offer to babysit more for your brother but getting gifts in vastly different price ranges for two children with the same relationship to you is cruel. You didn't even get her an actual gift, just a gift card? Also, you're punishing her for what is almost certainly a parenting fail - kids who throw tantrums like that and use inappropriate language so young are usually victims of poor/neglectful parenting. Regardless, obviously playing favorites like this is not only rude, you are going to create resentment and bad blood between the two kids. Super unfair to both of them."
dl7nai,NTA. You should probably have treated him to ice cream after though.
dl7nrr,NTA but how long did you even know this person before getting married? Sounds like you two rushed into it recklessly and now you're realizing that he has either a spending addiction or at least horrible money management skills that are going to ruin your life if you stay. Time to find a way out of this marriage.
dl7o2o,NTA. I would stop playing with someone who had outbursts like that.
dl7ry2,"NTA. Abuse survivor here. I told a friend about my abuse in 5th grade (after I had already told my parents and abuser was out of the picture). Friend told his mom who called a mutual friend of my mom. Mom bitched me out for telling my friend because it made the family look bad. If ONE of those people had told a counselor, it would have been mandatorily reported and my abuser most likely would not be walking and living free. Unfortunately, my mother was too interested in protecting her reputation, so she never did anything about my abuse and he was never prosecuted (small town, abuser was a family member so same last name). I have never forgiven her. You did the right thing. The abuser deserves to be prosecuted. Someone can now step in and protect your friend the way she deserves."

I expect this will get downvoted because this sub is very much “you don’t owe anyone shit”.

But the truth is in the real world if people throw you a party you’re supposed to nod and smile and pretend to enjoy it. Because it makes them happy. 

And sure maybe it’s not how you want to spend your birthday but making your whole family happy should be more important than how you spend your birthday.

Edit: Thank you kind redditors for the awards. I realize many, many of you disagree. I’m afraid I’m going to stop replying to the comments as it’s just getting exhausting. The lovely chaps who felt the need to message my inbox to tell me how much I suck - that was uncalled for - perhaps instead articulate your rationale in your own comment."

dl8jlb,"NTA. If your sister isn’t smart enough to realize that you can’t watch zombie shows in front of a toddler, she shouldn’t be watching tv in the common areas of your home."
dl8onv,"NAH. She is allowed to be upset, because she is a child who is upset at not being allowed to go. She feels like this is an injustice, and she may feel that you don’t trust her, and she may feel left or at school/betrayed by her mom. All of those feelings are normal for her. BUT: This is a good opportunity to sit her down and teach her about “sketchy” parties versus “safe” parties. Don’t have this conversation when she’s upset, wait a couple days. Walk her through why you thought this party was “sketchy”. Keep the focus on her safety, and teaching her “warning signs”. Good luck edit: maybe if she responds well, you can even help her host a “safe” party for Halloween. Teach her how to keep herself and her guests safe. And definitely revisit this conversation in the future, maybe around 7th or 8th grade, adding in drug and alcohol safety, and information about sexual assault."
dl8pzf,"Based solely on how you worded it, you’re the asshole. I understand the need to want to spend something on yourself, especially considering the money isn’t something that you were planning on it anyway, i.e. paychecks or bonuses or things of that nature. I do question though, are you the only one that is going to be able to use the computer, or would it in fact be a computer that you purchased for yourself that the family still uses. But the fact that you want to spend money on yourselfI don’t find to be terribly upsetting. Like I say for me YTA simply because of how you worded it."
dl8rgt,"YTA. Not only do you make him sleep in his dead mothers room, but you also use it for storage? That’s not okay."
dl8sek,Going with NTA. I think people are getting hung up the drugs part. If she was just drunk would it have been ok? To everyone saying she’s the ass hole is she just supposed to not go out at all anymore? Thats like saying it wasnt my turn to watch the kid so I decided to go out and drink with a few friends and got a little drunk and then my ex yelled at me for it saying I had a kid and so I can’t do that. Thats pretty ridiculous IMO she is still allowed to have fun and was essentially “off the clock” because her ex had the kid. I know parenting comes with some sacrifice but you can’t just sit at home and be available 24/7 waiting for something to happen.
dl8yno,"YTA - you broke someone else's belonging and your response is ""well they should be more careful?""

holy moly"
dl8zex,"NAH - Regardless whether or not she has a disability, she is still disrupting others around her. I don’t want to call her an asshole because maybe she simply isn’t aware of what she’s doing. She very well could be, which would make her an asshole, but it also sounds like she hasn’t been given the proper resources to combat this disability (as you suggested). 

So, no - just because someone has a disability doesn’t mean you must sacrifice your own well-being. Although - could you just move if she’s sitting near you?"
dl909p,"NTA,  I do not believe that all things have to be 100% equal across the board for siblings.

dl92d7,"You're N T A for feeling that way but dear God have some tact, don't tell your wife that you have a favourite! Some things *really* need to be left unspoken and this is one of them!

dl9bxo,NTA you didn't want her there and just wanted to spend time with your dad but he brought her with him anyway.
dl9etj,NTA you were just trying to convince her to give you at least one reason not to fail her you were being nice really. She watched a film and you asked for any views on it and clarified she just needed to say something not submit a well written review. She is being weird about it surely even someone who wasn't really watching would try to bullshit their way to a slightly better grade. I wonder if you were right about her having an issue if she is normally a engaged and happy student.

I get that the feedback was vague, but sometimes art teachers are trying to lightly guide you to push beyond where you are comfortable and to look at it from a new direction. The finished art in art class isn’t always about what you want it to be or what your usual style is but sometimes about trying out a new way of approaching it and seeing where that leads you.

Yes, they should have had the social awareness to dress appropriately, but their behavior wasn't ill-intended and it was too late for them to do anything about it. If the other people at the party have a good head on their shoulders, they wouldn't judge you for how your friends dress.

You didn’t call the ambos, your mum did because she didn’t feel the school response was appropriate.

I know you were slowly calming down but I’ve known people to black out during severe panic attacks due to hyperventilating and then had a fall. All risks the school should be aware of.

What if it hadn’t been a panic attack? 

It doesn’t sound like your first rodeo with panic attacks either? 

Maybe organise a chat with the principal and your mum about if it happens again is there a way to address this so you can either tap out of class and head to the office and sick bay.

In a professional establishment there’s no reason for a vegetarian (and definitely not a halal or kosher) dish to be cross-contaminated with crab and prawns. That was the obvious and sensible choice.

No, you shouldn't notify him next time. There shouldn't be a next time.  Practice somewhere else.  Use somebody else's house (not apartment) for the rehearsal.  Go to a park.  Hell, stand on a street corner and put a hat down.  You might make a few bucks while you practice if you're any good."

She could've chosen any number of the groups in the class but she specifically chose yours for that reason. You picked out the class members who are going to pull their own weight.

You should've tacked on at the end that you were sure that another group would probably love to have her. That then shifts the focus off of you onto them. You're now no longer pressured into taking her into your group.

That being said your group mates are kind of dicks for railroading you and adding her to the group should've been discussed as a group. They're not ass holes either for wanting to just let her join and you're not an ass hole for not wanting to deal with the extra stress of having her. It's the exact same reason she gave for not wanting to be with the other slacker in the class."

But your friend seems to still think that you two could become more than friends. Even if he says he´s cool with the Status quo, it doesn´t seem like that. It´s not good for him to be friends with you if he has romantic feelings. Not good for his mental health and definitly not good for his relationship.

During the first year you can't overcoddle or overcomfort your infant at all, that's how they learn to communicate with you. I'm not saying pick them up every single time if they cry, but letting them cry for significant amounts of time without comfort causes more harm than good. 

Again, not a doctor so I would suggest talking with your pediatrician.

dlov3x,NTA Blackface is when someone who is not a black person paints their face black in order to make themselves look like a black person. Venom is a monster. It’s not blackface.
dlovwe,"NTA.  Your sister is behaving unethically, certainly.  However, she isn't the cheater.  He's the cheater, since he's cheating on his girlfriend (he sucks too).  

HOWEVER, you are very invested in this and need to exit the situation.  She is an adult and will make her own terrible choices.  You could give the GF a heads up, sure, but otherwise you being so involved will do nothing but make you feel awful."
dloxcn,Petty but NTA. Especially if you offered to split the maintenance cost 50/50 which is totally responsible if not generous.
dloyv9,"NTA, if anything your boss is the AH for showing favoritism towards his employees. You have a solid reason to go, so it is your decision to give that up or not. She doesn't have more claim to something given to you than you do so just do what ever you want. It would certainly be a nice gesture to give these tickets to a bigger fan but her response really took any sympathy i had for her situation."
dlozda,"NTA .  Not only would I hold onto this particular grudge, I would wear it as a hat forever.  A badge of honor.  And a reminder that people are not DIFFERENT when they are drunk - they are who they are, stripped of the polite sheen they wear for appearances.  Fuck ‘em.  Your entire family wants to be with you (not them).  That’s a great thing."
dlp0pn,"NTA. You were 9 years old. I wanted to be an astronaut at age 9. I am a dental assistant now. 

Point is, you grew up. He can’t seriously expect a 9 year old to stay with the career path they chose."

That is kinda what he wrote but I don't buy it.

I don't think they were dating as much as he thinks they were, especially the thing with new guy was ""next week"".

&#x200B;

> M: It doesn't have to be that way we can still be friends but, I feel like you're pushing me away and if this continues I'm going to have to stop being your friend. 

Declaring that you are not going to be someone's friend is a very teenager thing to do.  He explicitly ties his current friendship to a condition.  ""*Have me more in your life or not at all*"".  A guy trying really to be friends isn't going to attach requirements to it.  People will often not speak to all their friends as much when they get in a new relationship.  It happens.

Dude is 100% into TG and is all salty that WK came around.  Which happens, but him acting like a jerk about it makes him the TA.

""Change my mind"" as the kids say."
dlpdgy,YTA because you’re gonna have a ROUGH time in the world if you can’t deal with feminine products being in a trashcan near you.

dlpkgt,"I wonder if they don’t like THIS 45 year old.  Is he divorced?  Like fully, completely divorced?  Kids?  How old? 

Regardless... I will be honest with you: i am 45, and if one of my friends took up with a 23 year old I would be totally skeeved out.  I would time travel to forbid myself from dating a man in his mid-forties if I had done so in my early twenties.  

I am sure he has a lot of qualities that you find attractive.  Guys your age a collective set of immature dbags.  I get it.  But, I would never want to be with someone half my age with such a life experience discrepancy (I don’t care how hot/smart/greatinbed he is.)  I suspect this is what your parents are thinking. 

Their methods are counterproductive, but I can see why this relationship makes them want to take a long, hot shower and scrub this all away.  

NAH- it’s just everyone reading your post knows this is going to end horribly. Except you.  He probably knows it, himself."

Your mom sounds insanely controlling. You telling her that you don't want to should be enough.

You’re the one giving too much and not giving anything in return. You can’t put unspoken expectations on people.

dlqh8s,So just because you can't do it 100% it's not worth trying at all? That's some flawed logic imo
dlql9u,"YTA. I don't mean that maliciously because your reasoning makes sense.  But it's still an asshole move to do when you could theoretically park in your driveway and then move when your girlfriends come over so that you walk a few blocks and they don't have to.  Do you have every right to do what you're doing? Sure.  No one owns street parking.  But doing something that is technically legal and justifiable doesn't mean you aren't an asshole for doing this.  But when it comes to parking, everyone's an asshole anyway, so this is more of a non-judgement. 

-- Sincerely, someone whose household has to rely solely on street parking only to see the people in the complex across the street with two car garages for every house park in the ~30 street spots that are our only parking option"
dlqmd0,"NTA 

Your sibling is sad, but that’s not your problem and you don’t need to take it on."
dlqor5,"YTA artists are already critical of themselves. The way you said that ""criticism"" of yours was downright hurtful. Imagine spending time and effort into something just so your so called friend bashes on you. That's pathetic."
dlqr92,NTA. Do not allow them to use your wifi. If he is looking up some sketchy stuff you could get the blame for it and he could end up downloading some big things that will slow your own connection. I'd only do it if your router lets you set up a guest access that lets you view and limit their use to prevent sketchy sites and large downloads.
dlqs1v,"NTA

> he is currently in a long distance relationship (about an hour)

Really? An hour? That's considered long distance these days?"
dlqs3x,"YTA

All you did was make drama for their family. She is going to be 18. This doesn't concern her parents at all. Besides, it will be somewhere hidden, so who cares?"
dlqt5o,YWBTA.  It’s your job to take money from people.
dlqtkp,YTA. You know he doesn't like being in pictures and you pushed him anyway
dlqu9g,"NAH Honestly that's just rough. It's not the fault of the children/mothers in Vietnam but it's also not you or your sisters faults. And if I was in the same situation I probably wouldn't want to meet them either...but maybe your dad left harmful memories to them too. And maybe they need you to help them heal, and you need them more than you realize. It's a lot easier to heal over a shared trauma together than alone. I would at least meet them, but not meeting them doesn't make you an asshole either."
dlqv6m,"NTA. His ""weird"" sense of humor doesn't mean shit if you're uncomfortable. You might lose a ""friend"" but if he's regularly making you feel uncomfortable at work, you're probably better off."
dlqw47,"Is she on crack? Your mom is nuts to even think of asking her child for a loan, much less a college student!!! Hell no NTA, your mom is a giant festering, oozing wart covered one though."
dlqwqn,[deleted]
dlqyuk,"Eh, a light/technical YTA as filling the car up is the convention for borrowing it and you could/should have allowed yourself time to put fuel in it.

That said, a bit odd of your friend to genuinely scold you for not filling it after explicitly telling you that you don't need to do that. I don't know that you deserve a scolding for this minor faux pas. Perhaps friend thought there was more fuel in it than there actually was when they gave it to you."
dlr1gu,NAH. I’m not really sure what the conflict is except for maybe your dad being a little cautious about upsetting family.
dlr1ot,NTA - She was bullying you.

She can pay $130 to rent a car.  She doesn't need to inconvenience you.  Besides which, the cost she be able to be reimbursed by her employer or deducted on her taxes (if self-employed).

Also, if she has a an accident in your car, you could be held liable for any damages to other vehicles/people that aren't covered by your insurance."
dlraai,NTA. Please please find a bird rescue. Birds live a long long time and get very depressed without proper care. You would be TA if you let the bird live in those conditions.
dlrar3,"I'm probably gonna be in the minority here, but I'm gonna say NTA. A gift is supposed to be about showing someone you care about them but these kinds of gifts say the opposite. Spelling your name wrong, that's a new level! This behavior sounds pathological to me, honestly. 

Anyway if you do say something just make sure it's a suggestion, not a demand, and prepare to still get crap and donate it."
dlreqx,"INFO: are you aware of her mother's feelings or stances surrounding guns? Is she someone who is openly opposed to folks owning and using firearms? Was she opposed to you owning firearms while you were together? 

If this was something you knew she wasn't okay with and you introduced your daughter to it without discussing it with her first, I'd say YTA. But if that's not the case then I'd say NTA."
dlrfrs,"NAH

It’s always hard to tell someone you don’t like their gift and it’s equally hard to hear your gift fell flat. 

I think there is a happy medium. You could have told her that the perfume reminds you of her (isn’t it your signature scent, mom? I can keep it if I get homesick) and then talk about looking for your own signature scent."
dlrkmp,"''Then he said he didn't want to talk about this any more, and he's left to stay at his place tonight.''

Because you went out of your way to bake him more of the cupcakes he likes.

Its not your job to tell him that he's overeating

Youre dating a baby, NTA ( also dont date babies)"
dlrkww,NTA - sounds like something happened to her that she refuses to acknowledge. I'd say she needs to talk to someone professional.
dlrkxo,"NTA. You told her it was addiction related, that’s all she needs to know. It’s your ex’s business, not your current gf’s."
dlrmyo,"YTA.  If there is a line behind you, you should be pulling up to free up more space behind you in case more people are trying to get into the lot/line"
dlrp7u,"YTA. And so is your mom. You both owe your wife an apology. 

I see no acknowledgement of your wife's feelings here but plenty about your mother's. You and your wife are a team. You left her to struggle, let your mom attack your marriage, and now are trying to force your wife to play nice because you won't stand up for your wife to your mother. 

You mom should apologise, and you should respect *the mother of your children* enough to demand that she does. 

I'd highly recommend the r/justno subs or maybe r/raisedbynarcissists.  

I'm not saying your mother is a narc, but you could probably benefit from hearing the perspectives of people like your wife, and learning how to enforce boundaries."
dlrue3,NTA. If he knew you didn't like that sort of thing and bought them anyway then that's his loss. He can go with a friend or eat the money but don't let him make you feel guilty
dls378,">but it honestly feels a little insulting to think that I can't be honest about my problems in my own best friend's house.

dls74k,"NTA.

You're married to one though.   Does he still refuse to step up shes be a decent husband and father?  The day you got home from pushing a HUMAN out of you, he invited people over like you're entertainment, and can't step up to protect his wife and child?  What a douche."
dls8hj,"NAH. You're not an indentured servant, you are allowed to leave whenever you want, and McDonald's has high turnover, this probably happens pretty often.

dltmme,"You don't deny your sister's interpretation of her childhood, in fact you basically acknowledge it's true. You then go on to say everyone has moved on, when clearly she hasn't. You also don't address the fact that in alleging she's the scapegoat she's saying she got the worst of the treatment and so it might not be as easy for her to move on as someone else in the family. Your whole message comes across as victim blaming to me. Based on this message, my judgement is that your sister grew up with bad parents and now is dealing with bad siblings. I feel sorry for her for having such a bad family. I hope that you don't invite her to anything, ever, so she can more clearly see how awful her family is and start spending her time and energy on better people. YTA"

dltop6,"I thought u were gonna say you took the son you connect with because u like him better i was about to beat u up lol. No u did a good thing. I don’t see any issues with him telling his brother though. I hope the whole “keep this a secret” thing doesn’t make him feel alienated. He probably already feels different from his brother if he is distant. So the best thing to do is to treat them as equally as possible. Not only by taking them the same places and buying them the same things, but by also talking to them the same way and all the little things. 

Raising boys is tough and it’ll get way tougher when they turn 13-17. No matter how much you think ‘my boys are good, they’ll never give me a hard time’ trust me you will be surprised. 

The last thing you want is one of them feeling distant at that time and it sticking with him as he grows up that he is the different one. 

Much luck with them both <3 you seem like a caring father."

dlty1a,NTA. You are entitled to privacy. Your sister had no business going through your belongings.
dltyyx,"NTA, she sounds incredibly toxic. Good on you for being the bigger person and making sure you're civil at family gatherings. She'll most likely make up all sorts of shit about you and your family to tell your aunts, just let it roll off your back. It's too bad they can't see the real her."
dltzdh,"I'm tempted to say E S H, because that sounds like an awful time for them that you made more difficult and stressful.

But they're asking you to perform in public with them.  If you just went with the flow during this practice, it would suck for all of you later and might reflect badly on you professionally (I'm not sure of the circumstances).  I'd be angry at them, too.  NTA"

dlu3yl,"YTA. You invalidated a kids feelings because Justin is a nobody and Benjamin is well known and connected to your family? What has him being even remotely Korean got to do with it? Is it because he is Asian? Let's be honest your entire post reeks of hidden racial prejudice.  You're not dating him, neither is your inner circle of friends dating him, your daughter is and 8 months isn't exactly a fleeting romance. I'm giving Justin a hats off for being polite during the play and waiting until you were all in privacy before going off.  He had the gall? No.. he had the right to feel disrespected. Your daughter is defending her boyfriend which she has every right to do so."
dlu49h,"NTA, you gave her a valid reason and it sounds like she accepted it which is great. But, you didn't mention how she reacted to the letter you sent.

But if you feel it's too early to put that to the test then that's cool, don't feel bad about it."

dlu4t1,"NTA. 

Daughter of an alcoholic here. It isn't easy. Don't let him turn it around on you. You have every right to say that you feel uncomfortable with his drinking, and his reaction is probably partly because he knows he's in the wrong and can't deal with that. Don't let him make you feel bad for voicing your feelings. He shouldn't be getting drunk enough to behave that way to begin with, especially if it's a regular occurrence."
dlu5cc,"NTA

She's basically taking advantage of your kindness and is basically a freeloader. Just cuz she picks your son up from school doesn't equal the water, food, eletricity, wifi (if she uses it) or shelter she's been using. She's an adult and should understand this. What parent wants to be freeloading off their kids anyway? Tell her she needs to be out by a certain and if she doesn't take you seriously then start the eviction process through the courts."

dluimv,"ESH

Your BF’s mom was incredibly rude but avoiding her isn’t going to solve anything either - especially if you hope to have a life in a French-speaking area with your BF. Speaking of your BF, where was he in all this? If he’s not calling her out for her rudeness, you may have larger issues. 

Yes, you probably should have started learning French before actually landing in the country. An immersion class would probably serve you better than your boyfriend/app method.

Edit: I just saw you are using Duolingo. It’s a great app, but it’s definitely not a super-quick way to conversational French. “Il a un petit requin” is a funny sentence, but not very useful. Babbel and Busuu really helped me beef up my rusty high school French."
dluj5g,[deleted]
dlutdb,"NTA. This person sounds manipulative and abusive. If I were you I’d block him again, and every time he tries to reconnect just block and avoid until he goes away. It’s not a depressive episode, he just enjoys being mean."

dluwgp,"What are you, like 15 to be so stupid to answer that question honestly?"
dlv2id,"Info: does she say the same about your wife who’s working full time to support a family and raising a newborn? 

Honestly it seems like your wife (rightly) wants some support from you in this new time. I fully commend you for the work you’re putting in, some guys do way less. But it probably hits a very raw nerve when your mom is mothering you when you didn’t do the “heavy lifting”   

That said I don’t think YTA but I do think you’re being a little insensitive"
dlv4g0,"YTA, majorly. Women can and do get pregnant the first time having sex with someone and it takes two to tango.

Maybe you should talk to him about why the fuck he would think that?  get some closure on the situation perhaps"
dlvj7t,"NTA. Honestly your friend is kind of an asshole for not “wanting to get in the middle” of some kinda shitty bullying behavior. Imagine if this wasn’t a group chat, but a daily dinner where you were all sitting at a table together but two people literally pretended you didn’t exist and the other two, supposedly your friends, just let it happen. Would anyone doubt that those were four terrible, terrible people?

You deserve better."
dlvlgw,"YWNBTA if you called CPS and were completely honest about what you heard.

YTA. 1000%. Your kid has a chance to work through this in a healthy way in a safe environment where she feels comfortable - her school, with her friends. You’re denying her that because you’d rather indoctrinate her than allow her to process a traumatic event in a positive way.

She’s SEVEN. I’m pretty sure you pulling her out of school for a week to yell at her about Heaven and Hell is not going to help her in any shape, form, or fashion.

Also, YTA for being a dick about your wife’s commitments. I’d ask what gives you the right to rearrange her schedule without her consent, but I’m picking up a strong “the Bible says I’m the head of my household” vibe here.

dlwiov,"NTA. Your neighbors may not be disrupting quiet hours, but when you complained to them, at least they should know by now that they're causing disturbance. It's also really inconsiderate to play music too loud especially in a residential establishment with no proper sound proofing.

This happened to me before in my previous dorm There were tenants in a different room on our floor who played very loud music and would often make too much noise like they were having too much fun. We could hear their loud banging on the walls and doors. We complained and were asked by the admin to ask around at least 3 other tenants who are disturbed by their noise. Then we were asked to come back to submit a petition with signatures from other tenants so that they could confront the noisy tenants about the disturbance.

You could probably do something like that and tell your landlord about it."

What you're describing is a situation where your dad is in hospital and you family is still doing round-the-clock care. That's just not reasonable or sustainable. What it also means is you probably aren't educating your kids to the fullest extent, your mom may have the most time of all of you, but your sister has absolutely no time to herself to get away from working or being a caregiver.

Your dad needs constant care. I get that you dislike this particular nursing home, but consider that your father was likely a high fall risk and could have broken his hip anywhere, including under your care or at any nursing home. Look for a different nursing home, or visit frequently at the prior nursing home. But look for alternatives here.

You said you tried twice with counseling and meds and it didn’t go well. Ok but that doesn’t mean you stop trying.  You are doing yourself a huge disservice but not working on this. It won’t go away on its own. You have to work on it. 

It took over a year to get my daughter with the right counselor and on the right medicine. She literally tried 4 or 5 before we got it right.  It was hard but it’s is worth it. 

She was also diagnosed at 12 and she’s 14 now. Since the right combo was found she’s been so much better. And by better I mean happier and able to make real connections with people.  She’s in school and doing really well. It’s still hard some days but honestly it’s like night and day from before she was diagnosed. 

Now I can say that she too didn’t participate in holidays during her darkest times and she has really come to regret it. Her grandfather passed away last week and she feels a lot of guilt because she didn’t spend the kind of time with him that she felt she should have. We are working on that with her psychiatrist but it’s something to think about. All the wasted time when the anxiety took over and ruined her ability to spend time with the ones she loves.  
 
I wish you a lot of luck.

She could be “out to get you” or she could just be an incompetent teammate. If your physical health WAS your biggest concern with this girl, the only person who could do anything about it is your coach.

Also. . .Is he even into that kind of stuff anymore?

Really the only thing I would say do differently next time is to offer him a nondescript opportunity to pick a weekend. Anytime my wife tries to surprise us with a weekend thing she just asks me if ""xyz weekend"" works for me. She won't tell me what she's up to, or who is involved, or where we're going. . .But she knows that the weekend that she picked absolutely works with no issues."

You had your invite when you asked to come along and they said 'sure'. I'm not quite sure what else you were expecting? 

If you neglect relationships, you need to either move on or start them up again slowly. You can't just dive in and expect things to pick up as is; other people have emotions too and you hurt their feelings by vanishing. Why would they invest time and energy in someone who might do the same again at no warning? 

Work on being predicable. If you feel a bad spell coming on, give people a heads up. Keep some level of communication going, even if it's just online.

If you need extra help with your daughter, then you need to find another family member, a friend, or hire someone.  But it has to be someone you both agree is a safe option.  You can't compromise with your daughter's safety.  That's far more important than a relationship with her grandparents."

dm8qmt,"Yeah, you would be one of two assholes here, but only because you guys are dancing around whatever the reality is.

He keeps 'forgetting' because there aren't firm plans, you're preparing to cut him out completely because you're assuming his forgetfulness isn't rooted in some anxiety or even legitimate forgetfulness- everyone's ignoring the elephant in the room.

Sit down and talk before they show up this weekend and ask him what he'd like to do while they're in town- dinner, go to the movies, whatever; and if he's still interested in meeting them. It's totally reasonable he'd be anxious and is treating it childishly (or is even really busy and forgets because there's no real plan in motion) but it's kinda on you two as a unit to solve for this problem instead of continuing to passive-aggressive your way through the weekend.

dm90b0,"YTA You have a right to pick where you sleep, no one is questioning that. No one is saying you aren't allowed to sleep in your bed whenever you please, and that is not the mentality to have in the conversation. The only thing at question here is whether it is morally fine for you to not sleep at your girlfriend's despite the fact your gf sleeps at your house.

To me this indicates that she does care that you two sleep in the same bed, or more generally prioritizes your time together. By saying that you don't want to sleep at her place (she probably also doesn't want to sleep at yours) she probably feels like she is sacrificing something for your relationship that you don't care enough to sacrifice.

You are ignoring the issues your girlfriend actually has with your sleeping arrangement to focus on an issue of ""rights"" and entitlement. I'm not going to comment on potential underlying issues unless asked, but this is definitely a problem of a lack of communication about priorities and feelings of distance. While your actions (sleeping somewhere else) don't make you an asshole, your mentality does. Normally this wouldn't be bad, but at the least, to her friends, you would look like an asshole."
dm93lb,"NTA if it is your account it is your decision. Since Netflix is getting ready to crack down on account sharing it is a good time to mention it.

dm9a7z,"NTA. I think you probably would be better to string them along more honestly with something like ""Thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the position. When do you need an answer by? Since this offer is so different than the one we were discussing before, I'd like a week or so to look it over"". You probably couldn't secure more than a week this way, but since they've been slow in the process so far, you never know and that might be enough to hear back from Company C.

If you still haven't heard back from Company C by the time you are officially accepting the offer, I don't think you'd be the asshole for going with your plan. But I'd at least try to stall first so you won't burn bridges if you don't have to.

Also, I just really have to say this:

>The recruiter is always ordering me/asking me to promise to “cease all job search activity” during their on-again times.

*NEVER* do this. Bad idea. At all times be continuing your job search until you've signed an offer. I think you know this, because you seemed to have done that, but just throwing that out for everyone who might be reading this."

you don't know why she was kissing her bear. she coulda been pretending the bear was her boyfriend, or maybe part of dealing with her abuse is personifying her treasured possessions. 

i was abused heavily as a kid and had a hard time forming friendships. as a result, i personified a lot of my toys. i gave them names, i'd say goodbye to them when i leave the house, and i'd have conversations with them instead of talking to myself. i even had a couple i'd take places with me, and i'm a dude. 

i never made out with any of them, but i was still a grown-ass man making adult decisions with a stuffed animal in my backpack until my mid twenties. 

i'm in my forties now, and still have a hard time forming friendships. i just replaced my stuffed animals with actual animals. talking to/at my cats isn't as weird as holding a conversation with a stuffed dolphin, but whatever.  

i doubt your mom will tell you which dumpster she tossed the bear in, but it wouldn't hurt to go check the trashcans outside. 

and a good rule of thumb for the future: if you discover a friend or relative has a super weird habit that no one knows about, ask yourself if they're really hurting anyone, and if the answer is no, forget you saw anything and leave it the hell alone."

dmavby,"Very soft YTA- mostly because of the situation and your age. But hear me out, because this will potentially help you as you mature and grow- assuming you still deal with depression. 

Your mental illnesses can explain some behaviors,  and can be a push towards those behaviors 

But

A mental illness does not excuse the behavior, make the behavior ok, or reduce the hurt that could be caused by the behavior. 

It may make sense to do something during a depressive episide- or even feel like you have no choice BUT to do that thing- like isolating.... that's depression, it happens.

But the people affected by it are still going to feel the effects. They can understand the partial cause, but it doesnt take away the consequence.  

Tldr: mental illness is an explanation but not an excuse, and does not make actions acceptable."

But you do sound rather judgmental of this perfectly nice family who you admit has treated you well.

It’s as if there are some walls you’ve had to build up to survive, so that may be something to bring up with your therapist.  

At the end of the day, you have to do what you think is best for your own mental health. 

However, I’m just a person on the internet.  Reddit doesn’t know you like your therapist does, so I would say that you should take that persons advice more than a stranger on the internet’s advice.  Unless if your therapist is shitty, in which case I’m not sure why you would continue to see them."

You need to take care of your mental and physical being as well, i am sure you're a caring parent, otherwise you wouldn't care about how your daughter feels.

Also if I’m doing the math right, your sister? Is the asshole here.   She should have asked you first then if you said yes, tell your kid.    That’s crossing a boundary by her telling your kid that they are going to do something awesome and fun, only for you to say no and make you out to be the bad guy.

Third, would you be speaking this way if your girlfriend had a vibrator or other toy she only ever used alone? I assume you listen to her when having sex and are concerned about her consent.

You come across as one of those vegans attacking other vegans for ""not being vegan enough."" If she's eating more plant based, you should support her, not condescend about how she's ""not really a vegetarian.""

You weren't the right target for her outrage, but she's still very young and still learning, so while I think she was *wrong* to say that to you, I don't think she was an *asshole*. 


You're not the asshole either, but, you might consider *why* it is your preference is to draw women whose main feature is their breasts. I think that it's true that drawing them this way is sexualizing them, by making a sexual feature the focus of the drawing, and while there's nothing wrong with that necessarily it wouldn't hurt to think through your preferences."

I get that you want to go to college. I appreciate that you’ve made sacrifices. But those were sacrifices you chose to make.

You have every right to be upset at what she said and occasionally being upset gets the best of anyone, so you snapped back at her.  Never anyone's finest moment, but it's understandable.

This isn't your problem.  

He isn't your brother, he is just the kid of some guy your mom married.  

Expecting a 17 year old to give up their life for that makes them so blatantly the assholes that what you do is minor.

Now, having said that you need to reiterate that you aren't happy with this situation and if they want his behavior to improve they need to leave him with a qualified child caregiver.

dmketg,"NTA.  You shouldn't have to share a room because your brother wants to sleep in your bed... but your parents probably bring up a valid point.  He's spent the last 10 years with a roommate.  He might be really uncomfortable sleeping alone.  On the flip side, they're dumb to enable him because in two years, you won't be there *at all* and I doubt your parents are going to let him sleep with them.

Suggestion:  help him get to bed, maybe lay with him for a while as he drifts off to sleep.  Then get up and do your work.  (I do this with my own child.)  You're the cool big brother; I'm sure he'll appreciate it, and if it works, you'll both be better off."

The bottom line is your son is only four and should not be subjected to unfair treatment by adults, and if you can shield him from that you should. 

If very unfortunate that your mom won’t be able to see her family for the holiday, but I would suggest you have a heart to heart with her about how you felt and how your son felt during Christmas last year and how you want to protect him from your family’s prejudice. He’s only getting older and only will become increasingly aware of the differences in treatment between himself and the other kids. Plus, it’s not healthy for him to see you and your husband being mistreated either. He should be surrounded by love everyday, especially including holidays. 

Maybe talk with you mom about creating your own traditions this year and do something extra fun and special for her, since she will be missing so many loved ones. But also, I hope she is able to understand why this is in the best interest of your family and your son. You can understand why people are behaving a certain way. He cannot, and should not have to, understand such things yet. 

Also, maybe you can help your mother skype or FaceTime your family on thanksgiving so she can see their faces at least."

They are aware of the issues and have made their decision to still invite him. Christmas is a very emotional time and even though there are obviously issues with your brother it might just feel like too much of a big deal to them to exclude him from a family celebration like that. I think asking them to do that would put them in an awkward position because they are clearly not comfortable with it or they would have done it themselves. I would just agree with your brother in advance that you are not buying presents for each other any more, then you will not be resentful that he didn’t get you anything because you will be expecting it and not have got him anything either. You can phrase it from a financial, practical point of view not personal. There are a lot of expectations around presents and if you have an agreement not to exchange them then it can take the pressure off an already strained relationship."

Your parents are the landlords. They need to be the ones to handle a potentially serious problem. You don’t want her to go crazy and go confront them over what you said/did and they’ll have no clue what’s going on. 

“Mom/Dad, Miranda is on the phone a lot with her windows open. Sometimes until 1am. She’s swearing and yelling right under my window and below Sister’s room. I know Sister can hear it because we talked about it.  It’s affecting my ability to concentrate, to relax, to study, and to sleep. Can you ask her to close her window when on the phone and not talk so loudly?” 

So, no clutching your pearls that it’s harming Sister (she’s heard it all before), no ultimatums, no whining, **no “confronting”**.  Just here’s the problem, why it’s a problem for me (not Sis), and here’s a solution.  

If they refuse again, it’ll be time to move out. If you can’t do that yet, put on your headphones, turn on a white noise machine, and focus on something else."

His wife pulling you aside was dumb. It wasn’t her business and she butted in. 

I’d write all this down with all the details of this particular incident (don’t necessarily go into everyone dislikes him and all that) and talk to admin about it. If there are other instances in which he’s been disrespectful then I’d document those too. 

You’re right that speaking to him in a certain tone is disrespectful on your part but as teachers if we want our students to respect us, escalating the situation by being disrespectful back or being sarcastic or condescending doesn’t help. He’s the teacher. He’s supposed to be the bigger person in this situation."

The ceremony may include religious aspects, but the point is to support your friend getting married and be part of this amazing event in his life. The reception is just a party. You’re being selfish. 

FWIW I’m atheist, and I’ve sat through many religious weddings — and also funerals, Christmas Mass, a Havdalah, a Friends meeting, LDS services, and more. You do it bc you care about them and want to show your support, not bc you believe all the details of their religion (or even any)."

dmrxpb,"NTA, it's shitty that he talked crap about you and let her toxic attitude/negativity influence his treatment of you.

But also, you know first hand that your friend is in a toxic, potentially abusive, relationship (don't know the full extent of the toxicity) and his decision to leave has to be his own. I get you trying to help him leave/make a plan, and also the whole concept of ""wasted time"" but i would encourage you not to think of it that way.

You tried to support him, I'm sure his girlfriend ensured isolating him from you was the best means of continuing their partnership because you were playing such an active role in him attempting to end it. You want his best interest, but it sounds like they're displaying codependent mentalities and people in that situation often aren't thinking about best interest. It's about what is comfortable, familiar, and what they've learned to rely on. Not to say you can save him from that - you can't. 

You don't have to feel bad. But if it would make you feel better, you can alwayd let him know you still support/care about him despite the distance. And then, if he ever does decide to leave her permanently on his own, that might help with some closure. Your decision was justified, and you supporting him can happen from far away if he never does move on."

If you don't like being alone, then it's a different story, find friends who lift you up instead of bringing you down. Having a friend/partner should never feel like a chore or bring bad feelings. (atleast in my opinion)

You boyfriends' friends girlfriend jumping to weird conclusions sounds like one of two things, either that you're sitting out for medical reasons hasn't been properly communicated (she doesn't have to know what they are) or she's like some insane weirdo who just jumps to weird conclusions. 

**Neither of those are your problem**

dmuciq,">just to tell her ""quit or you'll never see your son, his wife and his children ever again"" ? I do not know if her getting cancer is completely her fault, but I guess the heavy smoking took a really huge part in that.

This seems to indicate that you’re making an ultimatum for the purpose of convincing her to stop smoking. And that is a REALLY BAD idea.  Right now she most likely needs emotional support more than ever, and burning bridges with an ultimatum will probably decimate her emotional/mental state. And feeling awful about losing a connection like that won’t solve any of her problems, it would just create more. **You would definitely be the asshole** (YTA).

I suppose this ultimatum would be more reasonable if she was always acting mean to you besides smoking itself (like a “you had this coming” sort of thing).  However, none of what you said suggests she was intentionally acting maliciously on you; she just couldn’t get hold of her addiction. It’s not like she smoked for the specific purpose of hurting you, yeah?

I sense that you’re considering this out of good intent, but this would be a big mistake that would probably lead to a lot of regret, anger, and even more smoking down the line."

You were not going to be “alone”- it was your boyfriend’s party. Even if he was the only person you knew there, he’s still your boyfriend.

Expecting her to be there for the moments he’s not is pretty selfish, IMO. 

You should have checked if she could bring her boyfriend as soon as she asked - especially if it were that important to you. That’s a text conversation if I ever saw one.

Finally - you’re the one who stopped talking to her first. The 8 months of silence is equally on you.

dmwcm2,"NAH, but some advice.

As someone with mental illnesses, I know it’s impacting you, too, but many, *many* psychiatric medications, particularly those that deal with BPD and schizo-affective disorders have a weight gain side effect. Believe me, she is aware she has gained weight. She is likely suffering from self esteem issues because of it. You trying to make her lose weight, even if it is coming from health rather than aesthetics, is not going to have a positive impact on *anyone.* It truly needs to come from her.

And not for nothing, if your relationship can’t survive 50 pounds, it can’t survive period. My SO had a severe knee injury that laid him up for six months. He gained 60 pounds and kept it on for about two years. I had to do a lot more for him during that time, as he was also very depressed and anxious about his weight gain. He went from being an active, super athletic dude to a couch potato and absolutely hated it.

But do you know what was more important than his abs? My being a loving and supportive partner. I wanted him to be feel and be healed. I didn’t coddle him but I also understood the weight was a side effect, not the cause.

Focus on her mental and emotional health, not her body. The better she feels, the more motivated she will be to be her healthiest self. And if you can’t do that, then you need to re-evaluate your relationship.

Sorry to be harsh but I truly believe insides matter more than outsides."

I know *exactly* how she'd feel because my dad's mother was like this. You couldn't dare bring it up because she'd just call you an ungrateful spoiled brat but all throughout my childhood she'd bombard my older brother with multiple gifts, that were often expensive, and as an afterthought give me something cheap and even worse something she *knew* I wouldn't like.

Your boyfriend is a grown-ass man. He shouldn't need you to draw up a list of chores him as if you were his mother.

While he's never lived with a girlfriend before, he *has* had roommates. IMO, he has no excuse other than that his parents might never have bothered to teach him that housework is *everybody's* responsibility, and not just ""women's work"".

dn3c0r,"YTA. You may very well be friends outside of work and comfortable talking to each other that way, but when you are dealing with employees in the capacity of manager, jokes like this are inappropriate."

---

Big Joe was the one who bought up ownership, and all you did was respond to his jibe with one of your own. The problem here is that the woman didn't hear the whole conversation, didn't have the context to realize you and Big Joe were just shooting the shit, and assumed you were being an asshole. I can't really fault her for that.

My advice is to know your whole audience, not just the person with whom you're directly interacting, before making jokes like that."
dn3cjk,NTA. Cooking responsibilities should be shared. It isn’t fair for you to continually have to cook meals that you won’t be eating.
dn3dxo,"YTA - it's a tiny class, the problem has been caused because you decided to make your son do something you know you shouldn't have because you couldn't be bothered to do some homework, and you're teaching your son to exclude kids, and to ignore polite social norms.

It doesn't have to be fair, that doesn't mean you can do things however you want"
dn3exn,I don't get why your ex would keep it it it meant a lot to you sounds like the kind of thing you give back if the relationship ends. I'd say NTA but also seems like a weird story
dn3htg,"NAH. This is called setting boundaries, and it's healthy."
dn3p33,NTA. She isn’t making equal and fair effort.
dn3r92,"Put up a sign for UPS and FedEx that you are refusing all deliveries that are for the old owners name, that way they go back and you aren’t responsible for them.  Contact the post office and put up a card in your mailbox saying to return all mail to that name to the sender"
dn3voz,"ESH. Don't antagonize your sister. She's not going to see your side of things by getting back at her. It's only going to make things worse. If you don't like her and don't think the relationship is repairable, remove her from your life."
dn3yng,"YTA The whole cohabitating with a significant other, it's kind of assumed you'll be intimate. That includes sharing a bed. (unless someone has a medical issue like snoring/sleep apnea) If you're not ready to share space, then you shouldn't move in together. He wants a partner, not a roommate."
dn47xu,"ESH.

Neither one of you is giving the other person enough time to respond. If you live a 3 minute walk from the place you want to go, you can meet at your place. That way if someone doesn't notice their phone for a few minutes the other isn't left out to dry."
dn4ca1,"YTA. It doesn't take any extra time or effort to say ""Excuse me, I'M SO SORRY, running late!"" if you have to squeeze by. It's basic manners. You were rude, and you got a dirty look because of it. Now learn from it and let it go."
dn4d6d,Yta. Talk about making a mountain out of a molehill. You didn’t need to be present for the conversation that was taking place.
dn4g29,YTA. She explicitly told you this was what she was naming her son. Why in the world would you think it was okay to use the name for your own similarly aged and related child?
dn4hue,"NTA, but I do wonder how you're raising your daughter, if she thinks it's okay to speak to you like that. There needs to be a major change."

dn4mkg,"Watching your best friend be destroyed by drugs sounds utterly shit. I'm really sorry to hear it's got to the point where you feel like you can't repair the friendship at this point. 

I don't think you would be the asshole for asking for more rent if the relationship has deteriorated but if it's presently this bad, do you really want that burden hanging over you? I wouldn't even consider you an asshole if you kicked him out as having him around until he gets help is just inviting trouble. 

NTA, I hope he gets the help he needs."
dn4o5v,"NTA. The reason your girlfriend got defensive about being a bad friend was because she was totally acting like a bad friend.

dn4un2,You’d be an asshole if you KEPT communicating with them. Let them cry for 3 days n they’ll get over it.
dn4vpj,NAH. She could have told you that she only wanted to eat with him. Next time if you see two other people doing something ask them if you can join.
dn4w68,Nta. The night manager is. Who shows up over an hour late without even calling?!
dn4wd6,"Nta. What a strange party, I would definitely not go to that shit"
dn4z3t,NTA. You're just reducing your tip based on the service you received. You can't help looking 12 but she can help making you feel bad about it.
dn507x,NTA. Your mom was being ridiculous. Telling you where to find a pair of gloves wouldn’t have hurt her in anyway.
dn51sd,"Gee, I wonder why they don’t want to be friends with you. I’m sure it’s because of your race and gender and not because you’re hostile towards them all for no reason. YTA."
dn53da,"NAH.  She should see a doctor.  It might not even be depression.  It could be something else, like hypothyroidism or a vitamin/mineral deficiency.  Either way, there's no shame in getting help."
dn56ks,"NTA.  I do animal rescue, and they're doing the dog a disservice if they aren't helping it learn to be alone on occasion and accept other caregivers.  The fact that one spouse wouldn't even visit the other in the hospital is ridiculous.

The fact that you don't want to be reminded on your wedding day that they put their dog before you is fine.  Invite people who are thrilled to celebrate with you and will put you and your partner first on your big day."
dn58hy,"NTA.  Your boyfriend refuses to compromise AT ALL, minimizes your very real medical condition, then blames you when his cat destroys something of yours.  But this isn't really about the cats.  He's being a total disrespectful asshole to you.  That's the problem.  You can't have a successful relationship with someone who refuses to compromise and who disrespects you.  That's no way to live."
dn5a2w,"YWBTA if you tell your boss that you don’t want to help any student with special needs - therefore, since that’s how you stated your question, YTA. You would not be the asshole, however, if you tell your boss that you don’t feel that you have the skills needed to help this student, and that it would be doing her a disservice to continue having her attempt to tutor her without results. Special needs are just that - special and individual, and not every student who needs additional or different help will need the same help."
dn5b4s,ESH. Everyone is an asshole when they play monopoly - that’s the beauty of the game.
dn5cfk,"YWBTA if you did it in that manner. At that age, we are supposed to act like the world is this fair, safe space for them to grow up in.

However, a non-AH thing you could do, is after giving both children gifts, at the first peep of discontent, tell boy 2 ""oh, okay, if you don't want it, I'll keep it then"". (If he argues, you can push back, and say ""it's not the right thing, you always complain instead of saying thank you, you must not want it so I'll return it"") Save the receipt and return it. He will either have an attitude change or will learn a good life lesson.

Also, talk to his parents about this behavior."
dn5ctn,"YTA. You're supposed to be dividing up tips based on time spent, not on your personal evaluation of everyone's personal sacrifice and quality of work.

If you felt coming in was contingent on extra pay, then you should have brought that up with the manager--not unilaterally decided to tip yourself more. If I was a coworker of yours I'd likely be filing a complaint."
dn5g2d,"Your NTA for wanting her to drive, However YTA for getting upset with her. I am 17 and learning how to drive right now. I can't turn for shit, and my dad constantly jokes about it, but it hurts. I broke down crying because of the stress of it. Lighten up on her.

Edit: You also just can't say ""Teach yourself"" driving is a very important part of someones life, but also a very dangerous one. If you are going to teach her be involved."
dn5h79,YTA. Also a ginger here. She gave you a compliment. It's not her fault you are wildly insecure. You shouldn't have taken it out on her with your agressive body language.
dn5ho5,"The comment comes across like you were commenting about animals in the zoo. ""I liked all the elephants. I like to talk to elephants.""

You've never spoken to someone of color? You've only seen them when you were in Atlanta? Nowhere else? And you liked all of them? 

Is it racist? To me, it's clueless racism. It's like you are trying too hard not to be racist, but making awkward comments that come across as clueless.

YTA only because you are oblivious."

If it is in fact legally possible for you to sue then you have the right to do it. I don’t see a way you can do this without a shit storm though, so if you aren’t prepared to deal with the fallout of this interpersonally, then I wouldn’t do it."
dn5rqq,"NTA. They shouldn't have gotten a dog if they weren't prepared to fulfill all of his needs for the entirety of his life. That includes his mental wellbeing, not just his physical needs to survive."
dn5z42,"ESH.  You *have* to call CPS.  Whether or not they end up with the Grandparents or in foster care, they *cannot* stay where they are.  

It’s like you know their house is on fire, but you’re holding out on calling 911 because you’re worried about bothering the firemen/women.  Stop worrying about that right now, and PUT THE FREAKING FIRE OUT.  Make the call, right now."
dn6075,"NAH you should probably talk to the other girl’s mother or the school, casually, and see if you can shed any light about what’s really going on here. I’d lean towards inviting the girl regardless - sounds like they get on and it would do more harm to distress the child by not inviting her when the rest of the group are invited"
dn60ff,"NTA, seems to me like you are more mentally and emotionally stronger than your step-father. He is a total asshole for everything mentioned but also, your mom disregarding your concerns worries as well."
dn61e9,"YTA

If you know you have to tell. Otherwise, you're an accomplice and just as bad. Tell the wife. She deserves to know, if nothing else then at least as a matter of safety."
dn65ds,NTA better safe than sorry - if he’s not respectful of your boundaries then why have him around your newborn baby at all

dn6a5p,"NTA

Your dad is not your responsibilty. 

However to avoid legal trouble for your mom, you may have to go through the proper process for changes to custody and visitation arrangements but at your age I believe a judge is likely to let you choose."
dn6er8,"NAH, you were sharing your viewpoint fairly. The parent's sensitivity is more about what's going on with her."

dn6nkv,"NAH 

It’s not just your wedding day, it’s his too. 

You guys need to sit down and talk this out.    You shouldn’t wear a dress if you don’t want to but there are lots of compromises here. 

For example you could wear a dress for the ceremony and a tux for the reception. 

You could wear a tux for the ceremony and a dress for the reception. 

You could wear a tux and he could wear a dress 

You could get a tux and wear a dress over it. 

You could wear half a tux and half a dress. 


Point is, TALK to HIM. Not Reddit.   Reddit is terrible at this stuff. I mean look at my last two suggestions. You really want to trust us?"
dn6nuz,"YTA if you said you'd do it. Then you just leave? Also, your tl;dr makes you sound like an asshole. Why put it down in the first place if you aren't just being an asshole?"
dn6rw9,"NAH - Just so you know, it could be months before the babies eye color develops - most babies are born with a blue/grey looking eye color, and it can take months (even up to 3 years) until you see what the true color of their eyes will be.

I think you accidentally asked a sensitive question here, being unaware of the complexities of race and mixed raced babies, and the pressures darker skinned people may face to have ‘whiter’ features - be lighter skinned or not have brown eyes.  It is very understandable that your (edit friend) was a bit hurt or even offended by your question.

They're the parents, not the other way around. Try to suggest couples or individual therapists for them. Then kindly but tactfully let them know how this is affecting your relationship with them and your mental state. 

Maybe offer to attend the first session of couples therapy. It might help them view it as you passing this unwanted torch to a professional."
dn6y6y,It’s a tough one but I’m going to go YTA but it’s a soft one. I think you’re over thinking it a bit. Sounds more like he just really wants the two most important people in his life to come together. It actually kind of sounds sweet to me. Like he really cares about you both and it makes him happy for you two to both be a part of his life. He loves you both just differently.
dn6y8y,EHS. You agreed to go on the trip knowing you were the extra. The trip was specifically so she could spend time with these girls so I'd expect her to focus primarily on them and not you. I think you were way out of line especially as you started to snark. That said she sucks for inviting you in the first place and she created this drama by inviting an extra and then not taking your concerns seriously when you felt excluded.
dn6yr0,"Please don't do it. You (at the VERY least) can get fired or worse.Please have your supervisor contact his wife to clarify what you are allowed and NOT allowed to do - she may actually listen to a representative of the agency, and this keeps your hands clean.

His cleaning lady of a few months. Did she have anywhere near the close relationship that my mother or his parents had with him? No. Would she feel his absence months or years later? Probably not. 
Does that mean she didn't have her own grief for losing someone who was kind to her in the short time he knew her? Of course not.
You and the people that loved and knew your friend best can't be diluted or erased by a few over zealous Facebook friends, Its understandable to be angry at them but I imagine that anger is misguided, They likely are truly sorry for his passing, Let them have their Facebook posts, they are meaningless in the grand scheme of things, as much as you probably want to punch the world in the face right now, it won't make you feel better.

Stay strong my friend X"
dn78pe,"NTA

Their dog destroyed your headset so they owe you a new one. It doesn't matter if you have a spare- they still should replace what they broke."
dn79z7,"NTA  - you were going to apologise till she began yelling and didn't give you a chance to. I maybe would have given it to her straight; ""I'm sorry your kid got hurt, but he shouldn't be running in a store"" but even having said that she probably would have still gone off at you."
dn7ar7,"Nta. You just found a new friend, and a pretty good one."
dn7awt,"NTA - honestly, I think this is bothering you more because of the place you're in mentally than it would do otherwise.

Social media is the scourge of modern society (don't get me wrong I'm not immune from it's hideous tentacles either, but cutting most apps out has definitely made a difference!).  It's like watching everyone else's highlights reel whilst you often feel like you're living a blooper reel.  Or watching someone's utter hypocrisy being broadcast to the world and not being able to do anything about it that doesn't loop you into their drama or make your blood-pressure spike up to eleven!

So she blocked you on insta - likely because she's worried you'll say something to burst the 'Zen Mamma' persona she's adopted and is trying to build (because you know it's a persona and not real life!).  That's all about *her* and *her* insecurities.  

Sure it's rude and petty, but honestly, you have a lovely baby and should be focusing on bambina/o AND getting yourself healthy in terms of you PP depression.  Although it might feel important, this Insta nonsense is not.

So how to deal with her when you see her?  Act like it never happened.  Don't go out of your way to talk to her, if she engages you then do what Queen Elizabeth has done for 75 years when confronted with the constant inanity of her job and just *smile and wave*.  For you than means taking a deep breath, smiling, and removing yourself from her company as quickly as possible.  Be polite, but don't engage beyond a 'nice to see you' etc.

If she presses you on *anything* you don't want to talk about - do not be drawn - all you need to do is smile and say *We can discuss another time* and physically remove yourself from the conversation.  Don't be rude, keep your cool, don't be drawn into anything - *SMILE AND WAVE*.

dn7erv,"NTA  It sounds like the right thing to do, even if she is leaving soon anyway."
dn7f9e,"YTA. This is her place (of work? Performance space at least) and I just think if you blatently ignore her discomfort it makes you incredibly selfish. Don't make your ex perform for your date, that's all levels of messed up."
dn7hv1,"NTA, I’d think the same in your shoes and that might just hold true. She just started uni and she’s probably in this experimenting phase but that doesn’t mean she can treat you like absolute crap."
dn7kvj,"NAH.  With a caveat, you are overreacting a little.  

It's not like the 6yo wasn't supervised, there were two adults with the child.  Trips can happen no matter who is pushing the stroller, and some strollers are notoriously bad for being unstable and tipping on unstable ground.

This isn't an issue to worry about.  It's in no way an indication of bad parenting decision-making.  Accidents *are* going to happen, you aren't always going to make the right decision, and even if you do they aren't always going to work out for the best.  Don't make more of this than need be, and don't get carried away with ""what-ifs"".  Because they didn't happen, and if you are going to imagine all of the other bad what ifs, then you need to also imagine all of the good ones too, because they are just as likely to happen in an imagined scenario like this.

Let this go.  It'll serve no purpose worrying about it.  Concern yourself with real signs of child endangerment and bad decision making if you see them.  This isn't one of them."

dn7w57,"YTA if you do it against her will. That being said my grandmother recently moved to an assisted living community, after years of fighting it. I went up to visit her 6 months after she moved in and I was shocked at how much healthier she looked. She looks a decade younger than the last time I saw her. She has a ton of new friends, is always doing activities, and had so far enjoyed having her old friends visit. It is so much easier on my mom who ended up being her default caregiver before she moved to assisted living. 

But forcing her to go before she is ready is not ok. Get her a ""lifelock"" system if you're worried about her falling."
dn7wj6,YTA...your job is to drive and pay attention to the road signs...you need to ensure you know the speed limit when driving someone else for a profession.

Not your place. It's your girlfriend's little brother, you let her family deal with it. The coach didn't know who you were talking about at first so I assume you're not commonly involved with such things or he would have known right away who you wanted to talk about.

you started confrontational, and carried on that way. Not ""we were hoping to see him on for tonight since it's such a big night, get some pics and stuff. we're disappointed"" style, confrontation. Always a bad foot to start off on.

coach also sounds like an asshole so whatever, but you could have handled it better or left it for others who are more involved."
dn88mf,"NTA. The whole “it’s okay if people die from mistakes because natural selection” is a smug, douchey, shortsighted way of thinking to begin with. But to double down and tell somebody that, indeed, their loved one with special needs should be subject to natural selection really takes the fucking cake. 

I generally try and accept apologies when they’re offered to me but I would really have a hard time interacting with this person in a pleasant way in the future."
dn8cai,"You’re not TA for wanting alone time, but YTA for expecting her to be a mind reader and know what you meant by telling her she can go ahead and go to bed.

dn93ul,Is this a mean girls fan fiction?
dn9ak9,"NTA, but I think you should find a way to tell your friend you just want girl time only. I’ve had occasional friends in the past that want to bring their SO’s to every single thing, and it’s not healthy and breeds resentment amongst friends. You’re better off being upfront about it than having years going forward of fibbing about events."

dn9imb,"ESH Yes, he’s being incredibly insecure and wrong to say you’re flirting with other guys. But to be honest, if a guy was with another woman and complimented my smile, I’d be really weirded out. I just think it was a very strange choice when, like others pointed out, there are endless other people you could be complimenting who aren’t men his own age. It’s a comment many could and would easily take as flirting. It’s something men have said to me many many times when flirting with me. I just think being cautious for the comfort of your partner is smart, and really doesn’t take much. He’s overreacting but yeah, odd choice to me unless it’s culturally normal to compliment others like that without flirting."

dn9qr6,"Yta, for staying in this relationship."

I’ve been an audio engineer for decades. It is common to use sample replacement on metal albums but it’s still using the real performance.

dnaad0,I'm not sure how this made a difference to you since there was still just one person in front of you going to use the game or whatever it was. I would have assumed a person on their own queuing for a kids activity was saving the place. I think it's actually a good idea. So YTA it wasn't really any of your business.
dnacso,NTA - You’re a new mother who will be handling a newborn and even without that you are not obligated to loan out your husband to play a fictional character for children. Enjoy your family’s first Christmas together!

dnb7iy,"NTA, typical grandma lol. 
I've been dealing with similar issues. Because of my condition I can't eat sugar anymore. I told that to my grandma but she would still try to feed me with sugary things constantly even though I said no each time. 

I tried to have plenty of conversations about it but none of them really helped. Then I realized that this is basically her only way of showing love towards me, that's why she can't and doesn't want to stop. So instead telling her no, I tried to show her new things she can do for me instead of just feeding. Since then she finallyyy stopped trying to feed me each time and we have a much closer relationship as well."
dnbdst,"NTA. That’s a weird thing for him to do. Especially if it’s your close friends and not just people you hang out with. That being said, if your friends want to hang with him it’s not your place to try and stop them. Just let the people involved know that it makes you uncomfortable and then they can do what they want."
dnbee9,[deleted]
dnbezb,"That’s not the point though. The reason why YTA is not because you and your friends were talking about girls, it’s that you guys lacked the social awareness to understand that you shouldn’t be speaking about it AUDIBLY and PUBLICLY. If you don’t want people openly discussing your dick without your consent, don’t think it’s okay to openly discuss a girl’s tits without her consent."

dnbvrl,"YTA, you say it’s a good friend and just because she gets more men then you, you want to drop her ? Makes no sense. Grow up realize that life isn’t all about looks and try to be a good friend to her even if she’s better looking ... I’m sure she’s good to you"
dnbwz7,"YTA. You weren't being intentionally mean, but you are clueless and insensitive.  You were viewing your situation as the norm, when many people don't have the advantages you do. You need to actively learn how your situation gives you a leg up over most people, and take that into account in your interactions."
dnc50p,"NTA, just cause you’re blood family doesn’t mean you have to deal with his childish bullshit. Stand strong and be the one who doesn’t care about others thoughts. You don’t wanna be there? Leave"
dnc7hb,[deleted]
dnc9o3,"NTA. It’s bad enough that he forgot to return your stuff several times but then to put it on you by saying you should have reminded him (again)- super obnoxious, and I would have been frustrated too."
dnccyu,"Lol NTA. If she wants to hang out with them, she can make plans for some other time, specially considering she now knows you are uncomfortable with strangers interrupting."
dnciab,"NTA however I think there are better ways to deal with the situation. I would first get your mum on your side and you both tell her to not have the cousin as part of the bridal party. If she insists, I would shower the cousin in compliments at the wedding to make her feel nice. If they start bullying her, I would call them out right then and there at the wedding, and then leave with the cousin and calm her. If your sister is as mean as she says she is, she definitely deserves it"
dncifw,NTA.  You are an unpaid intern so you need to be getting something from this program as well as them.  Helping old timers psychological can have a legitimate educational benefit if you plan on going into a job like psychology that is your benefit and their benefit is they get a work doing something that needs to be done.  It is a fair enough trade.  You doing dishes does not have any educational or training benefits unless you plan on becoming a dishwasher and interning for that seems a tad silly since it is an untrained position.
dncqe1,"NTA: your friend is a tragic news story waiting to happen.  Teen drivers over estimate their driving skills and it often leads to horrific accidents due to excessive speed.  There’s probably no point in talking to her, because teens know everything.  I would refrain from riding with her, unless it’s just the two of you.  Studies show a higher likelihood of accidents when there are more people in the car due to a need to show off."
dncryk,"NTA, be upfront and tell how you feel. Worst comes to worst you find a new server and start again, best side is he listens and resales Ed his wrongs"
dncuai,"NTA- but you do need to sit down and maturely tell him what is bothering you and why. I also had a fight with my dad about making plans without asking me before and he was pissed but once he realized that he was not being fair he came around. Just tell him you can't deal with the whiplash, if you are so immature and ""selfish"", why does he want to go to the movies at all with you? Also, I don't know the condition of your aunt but I'm assuming if you were going to ask her to go shopping she's physically able so just say that to him, if she wasn't feeling well enough and maybe you didn't know, you can't read minds it has to be communicated to you. 

Maybe you can go every second weekend to your grandmothers or something like that."

dncyrc,"Why would you be N asshole for having a serious talk about respecting shared living space? 

It is hard however to tell a woman she cant have men over. I agree she should let you know. But if it's a safety thing, buy a lock for your door."
dnd605,"YTA(lcoholic). Get real medication for your OCD, not drinking. Anti-anxieties aren't addictive."
dndf8d,"I'm sorry, but you've been in a relationship for 9 months and not once has this trip he's been planning for years come up until he posted it on FB? 

...Are you entirely sure you're in a relationship with this person? Cause that's not something you gloss over for 9 months. On top of that, why does being in a relationship like this automatically mean that you have to adjust your sleeping schedule? Yeah, the time difference if you don't will cut down communications some, but that doesn't mean it's just over completely. And why does the onus fall on you entirely? He can't make sacrifices?

Now for the judgement, you can't be an asshole for your feelings, so automatic NTA. You're an asshole depending on how you act upon those feelings. You can raise your concerns with him about this and you can ask him to reconsider but that's about it. You can't force him to not go. 

But seriously, I don't think you're in a relationship with this person. Or at least the guy doesn't think he is. This is throwing up all kinds of red flags for me, and while I don't know exactly what they're indicating, it sure as hell ain't good."
dndpbc,NTA it's your house. I have the exact same rule. If she were paying rent it would be different.
dnduwp,"NTA 

Hate to tell you this....

>My mother was very resentful (understandably so) and would tell me about the awful things my dad would say about me, that I was fat, etc. 

Your mother is TA in this situation."
dne9l5,"YTA, sorry. He shouldn't have been comparing her physical abilities to yours, but that's not the issue here. He got a card validating his work and his efforts, and he's changing that woman's life fir the better. That is *so* different from romantic card gestures. It doesn't mean he doesn't love and value you."
dneg0u,What an incredibly stupid reason to be upset with someone.
dneic7,"NTA. At all. Just because it's tradition doesn't mean it's okay. Tribe wars is appropriating Native American culture and making it seem savage, honestly. The camp could change it very easily and your friends are the a-holes for getting mad at you. Just because something doesn't mean to be offensive doesn't mean it isn't."
dneoa5,"NTA it’s a sensitive subject and that’s the only reason you got in “trouble” for it. 

The parents don’t even know for sure yet if the kid is autistic and are probably hoping with all their heart that their kid is perfectly normal and that every other problem has a perfectly normal and reasonable explanation. At the same time, another part of them knows the kid is different and that terrifies them. Already he’s being bullied and he’s only just started kindergarten. What will it be like for him when he’s 10? 15? Will he ever be an adult that can live as one?

These are heartbreaking stresses the parents are under and while it was NOT OKAY to speak to you that way, maybe you’ll be able to forgive that mother if you understand the emotional pain the family is in. There’s a lot of fear and unanswered questions and they weren’t expecting you to give an answer they weren’t mentally prepared for."
dnerop,"NTA. An alcoholic never stops being an alcoholic, they just stop drinking. He should not be drinking anything at all."
dnet2a,NTA. In a house full of people you're the only one who washes them proper? Sounds like they may be doing it badly so you do it. I would tell them that if they leave it they you will chuck the whole pan. Your family  don't treat you like you deserve. I'm sorry.
dnewsa,"NTA, if you think this new school is better for both you and your father then you should definitely go there. However it sounds like your mother is worried about losing contact with you so I think you should be mindful of that."
dnf08e,"NTA - he said he would do something and he didn't, and it put you in a really bad position."
dnf24b,"YTA. 

Trying to police someone's eating habits is a giant asshole move. Trying to frame it as a ""but think of the baby"" issue to make yourself feel like less of a controlling AH is even worse. The line about telling her she needs to be less ""greedy"" is stunningly horrendous. Guess what? Pregnancy is a whole lot of cravings and hormones and physical hell, so STFU and let her eat some freaking carbs."
dnf77s,"YTA

>I am always very irritable on Saturdays (today is one) for a reason, she knows why.

That's not an excuse for your behavior.

>I thought it would be fine to subtly play the role of the annoying younger sister.

Intentionally being annoying is a dick move.

>""My parents talk about you a lot. But don't worry, they didn't say anything bad. Even if they did, I wouldn't tell you.""

Again, just blatant assholery.

>I feel like reaching out to apologise is only gonna make him scorn. 

Look, you were intentionally an asshole, so you owe an apology. If you give one - sincerely, not rolling your eyes and sighing and making it really obvious you're being forced to do it - and he scorns you for it, then HE'S an asshole. Admitting when you're wrong and trying to make it right is a sign of maturity that most people will appreciate."
dnf8x5,"YTA - if the kid is sick on dad's times, then hey guess what, dad gets to deal with a sick kid! Your parental responsibilities don't suddenly disappear when it's inconvenient to you...

Is this a shitpost, like putting a spin on the lice asshole post? O.o"
dnfa2x,"NTA, you realized you were wrong with helping him, so you stopped. You felt bad and didn't want to cheat but wanted to help so you gave him a hint, he should've read the prompt. Cut him off please! He's toxic. Tell you teacher if he keeps bothering you."
dnfftx,"NTA. Actually think you’ve been super thoughtful to not have your step-dad do it, knowing that it would be extra hurtful to your dad."
dnfjq6,"NTA (and your response is hilarious). Your child should not be constantly let down just because somebody else chooses to cancel plans without any notice. This is bad etiquette in any friendship, but is SO much worse when it effects a young child - who might not quite understand why plans keep suddenly changing."
dnfkx3,"NAH

Roommates or on-campus are off the table? But, definitely ask. Make it clear that you're not trying to take over, just spread out a little. It all sounds reasonable to me."
dnflw4,"NTA

Gratuity by definition is a voluntary reward or gift for services rendered. If the service was adequate, you shouldn't feel obligated to tip."
dnfmlb,NTA the son sounds totally normal and it’s good he’s exercising. The mum is being irrational. If she were to try and stop him from being a kid he would probably just rebel and do worse stuff. The first party with alcohol I went to was when I was 15 so 17 is quite reserved imo
dnfmww,"NTA, but as you know babies are extremely expensive. I would at least accept the gifts, and if you really don't want them, just sell them on eBay, CL, or FB Marketplace."
dnfnaw,"NTA.

Seriously, you are earning less than the people you are training. Leave ASAP. Don’t burn any bridges when you leave, but make it clear that they lost you for THEM being the assholes."
dnfnhg,"NTA. Part of being in a relationship is making big financial decisions together as a team. Especially if you share finances, or if his financial decisions impact how you pay rent/mortgage/bills, etc. Of course, he doesn't need outright permission per-say to make these types of decisions, but it's courteous of him to at least mention that he's thinking about doing this. You should have at least been brought into a conversation about it.

If he's making big financial decisions like this now, I'd be very wary as this could escalate into something more if you don't have a serious conversation with him about this soon."
dnfpxq,"NTA

Your marriage, your party, your invites."
dnfujy,"ESH. if your dad wanted another dog, go to the shelter and adopt one. there are already too many dogs in this world, the idea that you wanted your dog to carry on it’s family genetic line is absolutely insane to me. you suck for getting a dog and ditching it. your sister sucks for wanting a puppy when she clearly doesn’t have the time for it. your parents suck for convincing you that impregnating your dog was the best course of action in them getting another dog."
dnfvdv,"NTA Their still your family. Just because she doesn't want a relationship with them doesn't mean you can't. I still talk to my brothers ex-wife, they got divorced after 15 years of marriage. My family wasn't happy about that but they got over it. You have every right to maintain a relationship with whomever you want."
dnfxf6,NTA. I'm sorry but you have no responsibility to be anyone's driver. And that comment about appearance is the kicker.
dnfy7k,"NTA

Your friend is a leech."
dng5zp,NAH -  you needed space - maybe your family could have communicated a bit better towards your gf during the break up regarding boundaries however it seems like it was just miscommunicated as you said.
dng981,"I’m guna say YTA yeah. I get where you’re coming from that the wedding is huge and it’s a pain in the ass to travel back and forth, and I know catholic weddings are boring, but it would be nice to support your wife and it IS rude to say ‘yeah I’ll take dinner from you but I don’t actually want to see you get married’. Weddings involve a lot of faff and it’s irritating but sort of part of the deal. Also I’m sure if you ask around there might be people you can split the Uber with."
dng9l7,"YTA for thinking of this a gift. Basically what you want is for these people to wear your stones for the length of the relationship. Since you would retain final authority of what ultimately happens to these rings, you aren't actually *giving* them to anyone. You're just proposing a loan for the length of the relationship."
dnge4s,"Light YTA

She sucks.  If she's as bad as you say, she super sucks.  But you got a whole life ahead of you and it's better to build ""dealing with shitty coworker skills"" now, and not to screw your employer (and your own paycheque).

Do yourself a favour and use this as an opportunity.  ...Also, record whatever you have to if it means getting your clients out of a dangerous situation."
dngk35,"NTA. As I posted in another comment there is no requirement to give 2 weeks notice. It is a courtesy. A lot of people are saying YTA but just like if you screw up and get fired on the spot a job can screw up and lose an employee on the spot. The manager made this situation, you are NTA for leaving it."

dngl06,"NTA

dngpst,"NTA: he’s a grown man, he needs to wash his sheets. You’ve been upfront about it bothering you and he hasn’t done anything to fix it. He could wash his sheets or put on fresh ones before you come over."
dngrah,NTA It's important to show your children you have their back when falsely accused.
dngto6,NAH. You did the right thing. But you might want to branch out in your friends instead of torturing yourself with an unrecipricol attraction.

dngzcr,"YTA 100%

‘I told him he was probably only wanted the cash prize and to beat the other kids’

What’s wrong with you? That’s so messed up.

Firstly if you foresaw this issue then you should have KINDLY spoken to him before and told him that since he’s older and more talented you KNOW he’ll win (giving him support for his talents) so it would be unfair. Help him understand the situation instead of undermining him. What you did was very immature.

You could have also just told him it was a contest for the younger kids. There are so many healthy and mature things you could have done."
dnh0vb,NTA. You kept him from being hurt by people being cruel. You’re a good person.
dnh2km,"A good solution is to have a private ceremony with you and your fiancé at 5:30, and then have a second ceremony at a more reasonable time for the guests. The first one can be just the two of you reciting your vows to each other, or the two of you with a willing officiant and a handful of close friends/relatives who are willing to join.  If having two ceremonies is too costly and unreasonable, then just do the first option with the two of you only, speaking private vows."
dnh5kd,"You HAVE to speak up. You hear this kind of thing all the time. These people are in general scam artists looking for money. 

NTA. Speak up. Do it gently and have proof of this kind of thing. Ive seen YouTube videos of men paying 100s of thousands of dollars to these ""women"". Only to find out its all been a scam. 

Your uncle needs you to tell him the truth. Investigate this person."
dnh5op,"YTA if you remove the tables without speaking to your fiance first. That said, I think your fiance should see a therapist. Her coping mechanism sounds unhealthy, and having an empty table for dead celebrities is strange."
dnh69q,"ESH.  Yeah, her reaction to your gifts was shitty.  You are MARRIED.  Stop being petty and figure out what you actually want her to do.  If you want a better apology, tell her.  If you actually don't want to do gifts anymore, tell her.  If you want a specific gift list because gift giving shouldn't be a competition of how well you pay attention to random things your partner says over the year, tell her."
dnh6zf,"If her roommate didn't want people to know what she said, then she shouldn't have put it on Facebook.  Regardless of her privacy settings when posting.  If she wanted to vent about things, then she should have messaged a friend one on one.  Had you shared something she directly sent to another person, then you would be TA.  As it stands?  NTA"
dnhaq9,"NTA he's abusive straight up. i hate to say it though, but there's a chance your mom won't listen at all. she already seems to be in the habit of making excuses for his behavior. talk to a counselor or therapist, they may be able to help you approach it in a way that won't put your mom on the defensive immediately. i truly hope the best for you, and that your mom finds the will to leave this awful man!"
dnhfk5,lmfao thats so embarrassing 😭😭
dnhgy5,YTA if you don't say anything. If the relationship is as toxic as she's making it out to be then she needs to call it off with your brother and move out / on. It sounds like neither one of them was ready for marriage TBH.
dnhhpu,"YTA you don’t have to be friends with her but stop making excuses to be mean. She clearly likes you and wants to be your friend - stop being so blunt and heartless, and speak to her with respect"
dnho8y,"I mean all you can really say is you won't be together if she does it. You can't keep her from doing it so saying she ""cant"" is pointless. NAH."
dnhp8g,"NTA You get to decide your name. Full stop.

Of all my friends, only one changed her name. Got blow back from the Boomers, but they aren’t great with change."
dnhqbe,"NTA

Your parents failed at raising your sister and are asking you, the younger sibling to clean up the mess. You are being taken advantage of."
dnhuiv,"YTA, pull the stick out of your butt. He makes a conscious effort not to curse."

dnhwky,"NTA 

The world has enough pointless rules."
dnhwq5,"NTA, if they have been warned before then that is entirely their fault."
dnhxw7,YWBTA. trust your girlfriend. if you cant do that then you shouldnt be in a relationship.
dni02u,"NTA. This is a case of “she can dish it, but she can’t take it”. Personally, I think your joke is hilarious and the fact that the room froze like that means that it’s likely that you actually hit on a problem in their marriage."
dni37d,YTA You know you have a condition and you know weed makes it worse but you smoke away regardless.
dni4j3,"ESH 

Wishing death on someone is fucked up. 

You live 3000 miles from gma. Stop having political or serious convos with her. Decrease your exposure to her."
dni5un,"YTA. Based on the way you write, it seems like whenever he tries to speak to you, you brush him off and you do come off as condescending and rude."
dni62m,">  had no respect for others' property as he**just threw shit around like plastic cups and food**. Not to mention I have a Lan setup in my basement. And **he'll just smash the fucking keyboard to be funny, and searched up NFSW shit on the computer which by the way isn't mine but my dads**.


NTA

People who act like this shouldn't be your friends. He is a terribly inconsiderate person. 

You can both lay it out to him why people don't like hanging with him, and not hang out with him at the same time. 

If he asks why you are excluding him, be specific and honest. Maybe that will give him a wake up call."
dni6vn,"NTA, that 1/4 of the property is rightfully yours."
dni6xg,"YTA. I don’t even understand how anyone could say that you’re not TA in this situation. You’re making her birthday about your needs and completely dismissing the plans she has made to celebrate her big day.. bring a radio to the camp out, and listen to the game. 

If she doesn’t dump you for this, that is."
dni8tr,I don’t know why guys take so long in the bathroom to poop but this is something you will encounter for your whole life. You are NTA and maybe see if you can talk to your brother about doing his business in another bathroom at times where you need to get ready or shower.
dnigrc,NTA. It is wildly inappropriate for anyone in your family go put in their two cents while you are going through this situation unless they’re offering their support. You aren’t obligated to give your child to a family member and they obviously aren’t thinking of the ramifications of such an arrangement.
dnihyt,YTA- for thinking that your boyfriend can make you take it out.
dniki0,NTA.  Just because something is placed on a table doesn't mean you have to eat it.  Your husband needs to back off.
dnin69,"NTA

Sorry to say, but your sister has no ability to empathize with you or truly does not understand the situation. The idea that you should drop everything for this person is shocking to me--worse, she's judging your husband in the same way, calling him selfish. Is this someone whose opinion you want to respect?  I think that the parents are equally wrong here, and should have found a permanent solution years ago.

Your husband's reaction said everything--he's probably been carrying this around for a long time.

Advice: be honest with the parents that, no, you will not take him in, but that you will remain part of his life always. You may or may not offer to help the parents make arrangements, but that's up to you. Do not feel guilty here by any means."
dnion4,"NTA. Obviously it's her decision, but this sounds like more of a trust issue. It is definitely out of the ordinary to hide such a decision from your SO."
dnixri,YTA for how you handled it. Don’t interact with him again. Let building management handle it.
dnj2ik,"NTA. Vitamins (even from well known brands) are frequently not in the listed dose (overdose risk) and contaminated (risks vary by what the contaminants are). It’s thoughtful of you to look out for your friend, and you are NTA."
dnj31z,"NTA. Rent is typically based on number of rooms (so 4 rooms, rent splits 4 ways), but utilities are almost always divided by number of people. That 5th person is getting to live for free while the rest of you are having to pay even more because of their utility usage."
dnj7ff,"I honestly don't understand why someone would be upset that they get to choose the dress they are wearing, I have been in several weddings where the bride did exactly what you did and we were honestly thrilled. As a bustier person myself I really appreciated being able to pick something that would flatter. NTA"
dnj7mv,"NTA. He needs to chill out and be willing to contribute his half if he wants to go on vacations with you. He’s being a stingy jerk tbh. If you’re paying half then he needs to pay half too. Your loyalty points are still eliminating half the costs, and you could have used those points on anything but you chose to use them on your vacation, same as money. Saying it doesn’t count because the points were free is like saying that you can’t use money you got on your birthday because that’s “free money”. 

This is just him trying to get out of paying his part and it’s ridiculous. You pay $1000 and he pays $1000. As long as you’re paying that $1000 does it really matter whether it’s with points?"
dnj9t0,"NTA your business is your business. But what 45 year old me would say to teenager me is to give fewer fucks about what anyone says or thinks. Take back your power by not giving judgy people the ability to make you question yourself. Like what you like, it's cool. :)"
dnjb7n,"NTA - and I'm so sorry your father is a paranoid, dissociated, helicopter fuck. This is 100% an issue borne from your father's ignorance. I doubt you can talk sense into him because the whole situation is delusional anyway. If your mother is on his side too, you're really fucked. Work hard in school, work on your art, get into college with your own scholarships, and get the fuck away from your father."
dnjbgb,"NTA, if he decided to be an ass, an asshole treatment he should get."
dnjcc5,"NTA.  You working there doesn't take anything away from her.  You need money, you've tried elsewhere.  Take the job if you get it.

Do be nice by not rubbing her face in it - don't tell her stories from work unless she asks.

If I knew a company were great to work for, I'd *want* my loved ones to apply, because I want what's best for them."

dnjwtt,YTA if you don't report this business to the department of labor
dnjzbq,NTA - She used you up and then lied to you about the vacation. She never had any intention on going. Conveniently she picked a fight with you right before so she could blame it on you. Darlin' she gaslit you this entire way.
dnk5eb,A u-shaped pregnancy pillow (about $60 on Amazon) was a lifesaver when I was pregnant. I got huge. I only stopped using it when I was super hot all the time.
dnk8ds,"NTA, if she's not going to get in the spirit of the event, she doesn't deserve to be invited"

dnkkrf,"YTA.

Your dad is an adult, who is living in his own house and dating an adult woman.   They, the two of them, can have any arrangement they want regarding getting, keeping, and training their pets.

You are a tenant.   A tenant with a *killer* deal.   You live there *for free*, because you go to college and your parent wants the best for you.   

As a non-rent-paying tenant, you have almost no voice in this.   You do not have to participate in caring for the dog, but you cannot dictate what the adults who are allowing you to live rent-free in their home do.

Think of putting up with the dog as part of your rent."
dnkm0h,"NTA. She took on the risk of using her phone in a crowded place where she was likely to get bumped, and where she wasn't even supposed to be using it. She broke her own phone and is being pretty annoying about it."
dnknsg,"NAH, but keep in mind that your father and brother's way of remembering her may be keeping a portion of her nearby. It may be that some ash gets scattered, and some remains. Perhaps put into pendants, or made into memory diamonds?"
dnkp1u,What the fuck else would cold cuts mean
dnkv8j,I feel like this is being blown way out of proportion and made into a dramatic situation when it’s really not a big deal. Parents do this all the time to get their kids to try something new. Move on. There are real problems in the world.
dnkx4g,"NAH. This is a lot like 2 children getting different grades. One works insanely hard to get pass with flying colours and who excels at working. The other is terrible at school and just barely passed. 

Both people have reason to celebrate. You parents should celebrate your achievement as equally as your brothers, but who knows maybe they are just getting around to you.
I
I am proud of both of OP and his bro. Once again for different reasons. Your parents shouldn’t just focus on ur bro and give you some attention but that’s way parenting goes."
dnkxsa,"NTA . You guys didn’t take the weapons because of the whole stealing thing but technically they’re still yours as your dad never took them back. You just left them at his place. So I think your husband and you should keep the 2 guns you want, give that 3rd one back, and still get the same amount of cash from the rest of the sold weapons. I think it’s nice of you for wanting to use some of that money to do something with your daughter and I hope it all works out in your case"
dnkykk,"YTA. Not for your views on weed, which I definitely don’t agree with, but because they’re definitely not going to reek up your car for just sitting there. They’re your friends, and now they’re too impaired to drive - be a friend."
dnl04w,YTA your friend has free will and can say no; also it’s a 30 second task.
dnl04q,"NAH. I have twins and 3 sets of grandparents that shower them with gifts. There was always too much stuff when they were little. Being a neat freak it drove me crazy but I turned it into a positive thing. I didn’t throw stuff away, I had donation boxes and taught them at an early age to donate when they didn’t play with something anymore or thought another little kid might like the toy. I would put stuff in a box (sometimes sneaky if I just wanted it out).  So about once a quarter we would have cleanup donation days and go through clothes and toys and decide what to donate. Fast forward to now, they are 13 and they voluntarily put stuff in or tell me they have clothes or things that need to be donated.  A good side affect of this is that all the grandparents learned that what they give us may end up being donated shortly if it’s not wanted, so they became more thoughtful about things they gave over the years.

Making a speech at your wedding isn't about ""settling a score"" or bringing up dirt, and his dismissal of your concern by insulting how much you spend on your own damn wedding puts him firmly in asshole territory. You shouldn't have to jump over the moon just to get a smidgen of respect from him."

dnmqqi,"Well, he was treating her like a piece of meat and you didn’t want her to be treated that way. Maybe getting his feelings hurt is a lesson he needed on how to respect a woman.

You've sort of implied here that you and she have grown apart from when you were younger, or that the two of you were more of a thing then. This shit-talking may have been a bid for closeness, which you then rejected (at least in her eyes) and shamed her for. Does that make her shit-talking good? Nope.

Being a brat would be you stomping your foot and you demanding she stop seeing him, you are simply voicing your completely valid feelings about what you are comfortable with. 

You are not being unreasonable in wanting your home to be a space you feel safe in. 

Your mother can have the relationship she wants when you’re independent and living on your own, until then she needs to put you first, not herself and make accommodations for what YOU feel comfortable with.

dnrgcx,"Personally, I would stick with your friends.

Sack off making music if it isn't making you any money and get a full time job. 

The experience of being independent, self-sufficient and living with your mates is far more fun and important for your own personal development than focusing on music and living with your grandparents. 

You already seem aware that music is very unlikely a long term money maker for you, hence you saying you only want to do it for a year, but take this as a learning opportunity. 

My boyfriend lived with his friends all thoroughout their early twenties. They all worked shitty full time jobs to  cover the rent, and the extra they had, they spent on band equipment and practice space, and they just did the odd local gig here and there, and he says he loved that time in his life.

We're all pushing 30 now, live with our partners and have careers, but they still practice every other weekend and his band has landed a headliner slot on NYE and are being paid handsomely for it. It's not their focus in life, but they love it so they keep doing it, and sometimes they earn a little extra cash for it.

Take the focus away from your music and put it onto making money and staying with your friends, and you can still have fun with it."

If you really valued your relationship with delilah, you should have made more of an effort. I wouldn't call you an asshole for that, though. Delilah is justified in being hurt, but she should have communicated her feelings to you in a more constructive way and not just off and blocked you.

I understand both of your perspectives and can see how both of you are justified - to an extent - in your feelings. Perhaps writing a thoughtful letter or email to her would help. You can express why being there for her was difficult and apologise for hurting her. Then you can rest somewhat easier knowing you tried your best to heal your friendship with her.

I don't think either of you are assholes, you're both just hurting and miscommunicated."
dnrspt,"NAH 

I mean this in both a comedic and serious way...your baby is the asshole here. 

You couldn’t handle the baby, so you gave the baby to it’s father. That’s what parenting is. Teamwork! Dad took it on, though begrudgingly....but you guys are exhausted so it’s forgivable what both of you have done and the way you acted/reacted. Excellent job. We all covet sleep during these times and the truth is, one or both of you is always going to be sleep deprived. 

First, I would suggest some sleep training, swaddling, something....holding the baby for naps and sleeping is a really bad habit to have. I’m sure you hate that you do it by now. Come up with a plan together on that one. Try white noise or something. I know it’s so much easier said than done, but it is imperative to your relationship. Trust me, having a child in your bed for years to come is hell on a relationship. 

Parenting advice aside, try again. Next weekend, make it goal that each of you get one full night’s rest. Pump and go to bed. The next night, dad gets his full night. Make a deal that whoever didn’t get their full night, gets a nap the following day. 

These fights seem huge because you’re both exhausted and babies are assholes. It does get better though. Eventually, the baby gets really funny and it mixes well with the delusional tiredness."

There is one simple answer to any question asked that you don't want to answer:  ""Why would you ask that?""

You’d get one, but it’d break down a lot.  

I also think it’s unfair that they won’t let you drive it alone but I understand their perspective.  My mum also came on my first drive from Brisbane to the Gold Coast because it was a journey over one hour.

If my bf and I were in this situation, I'd probably tell him to do the training because I'd want to be supportive but I wouldn't be able help myself feel really depressed about the situation. He'd really have to make it up to me.

It would be a completely different story if you had the place to yourself and were happy with her using it even with you gone, but this is a shared space and therefore you have to take Dave into consideration too.

Especially since you only draw women that way (based on another comment of yours) and not men so it's not quite even in your art and implies the goal is sexualised art rather than just women that happen to have somewhat skimpy outfits.

If I was chatting with two other people, and one person did that, unless they were waiting for an important message / call, I'd consider them rude.

You don't have an obligation to listen to their conversations, and join in. On our office lunches, people all chat together, but some people sit and read the paper / do the crossword etc.

Dude, if you're ready to live with your girlfriend, that money should not be going to *your* savings.  It should either be going to the expenses you don't have covered, as your girlfriend proposed, or an emergency fund for both of you.  Frankly, you also probably should've talked about personal finances and obligations (or your lack thereof) in general so this didn't come as a total shock to her.  The fact you thought it would be okay to just pocket an arbitrary amount of her money each month for your personal enrichment without telling her the full deal is disingenuous in the extreme, and if I were her, I'd be taking several steps back from this plan no matter how good a deal it looks like on the surface."

It might be worth talking to a therapist about how to handle the Sparky obsession, since he is getting a bit old to be talking about him so much. I'm not suggesting there's anything wrong with your child, just that it might be helpful to know how best to manage it.

Stop using your phobias to police other people's behaviour. If anything, you need to be sure you can handle the party before going. You aren't even hosting the party! Back off."

does5m,"NTA. Your dad made you feel like crap when you were just being yourself. Please be kind to yourself and don’t compare yourself to how other daughters and girls are suppose to be. You are you and that’s all you can be. It’s okay if you don’t consider yourself that girly or feminine. Your father should love you just the way you are and not make those crappy comments about you. However, it sound like your dad is making the effort. Try to meet him halfway. Tell him how you feel about the comments he made and continues to make (even if he is joking)."
doetno,"NTA but it’s expected people will ask these questions as you’re often caring for them in deeply personal times and it makes them more comfortable to feel connected to you. Also, if it’s that rare there a other black people in the area it may be that they’re just curious as to where you’re from. I can’t imagine they’ll like you less if you were from somewhere else, it’s a basic question people of all races get not a slight against you. 

Maybe get some very vague answers you are comfortable with for the questions when they come up or find a response to let them know you’re a private person and aren’t comfortable. Could be tough to articulate in a caring manner though."
doez7e,"NAH, I can see both sides. A relationship advice subreddit might be better. Truth is, you don’t want to rush in, but she doesn’t want to introduce a father figure who has one foot out the door. Neither of you is wrong."
dof1uf,"NTA - If this gains popularity, you’re going to get a lot of Y T A here, but let me explain my reasoning - I’m a woman myself and totally agree with “free the nipple.” However, as it stands right now, nipples are sexualized and it IS a little trashy for her nipple to constantly keep slipping out. Having some nip slips isn’t going to remove the stigma, it’s just going to make others around her feel uncomfortable with her nipple being unnecessarily out because it LOOKS like an accident rather than intentional (and it is an accident, but she seemingly doesn’t care). 

Plus, men don’t actively have their nipples out in public places, either. Shirts/shoes policies are at many places for a reason, and that includes keeping your nipples in control. 

Again; *i support free the nipple*. When men have their nipples out, women should, too. But they don’t in public places."
dof1wm,NTA. Your friend is being an ableist jerk about this. You got those accommodations *because you need them*. You should use every single one and not feel guilty for a moment.

dof8u5,"NTA - You were very polite in even offering to be friends afterward. Although it's commonplace (and honestly, expected imo) that you may be dating several people in the early stages, it's kind of a ""don't ask don't tell"" policy. I find it very rude or immature that she intentionally told you that she was going on a date, and that his name was Kyle. The proper thing to do would have been to just not bring it up or vaguely say she had plans. She was probably trying to make you jealous.... you're better off."

dog04s,NAH in my opinion. they invited you on a trip and as long as you politely decline then it’s fine.
dog05l,"YTA or YWBTA. I have a lot of problems with this. Although you might not like it or agree with her methods, according to school policy, she has technically passed the class. If you’re not evaluating other students based on attitude, you can’t evaluate her that way either. That’s not fair or objective teaching. Plus, attitude is subjective anyway and ‘attitude’ can easily spiral into other subjective qualities that are equally unfair and have nothing to do with school performance. The bottom line is she did just enough to pass the class, so she should pass the class. You as a teacher don’t get to decide that she doesn’t have a good attitude. Furthermore, saying no one would question it if she fails just shows the lack of integrity here. It’s ok to do something wrong her because no one would notice or question it? Someone should stand up for this girl, regardless of her attitude, because she has the right to learn and be evaluated fairly just like anyone else."

dogqgn,"YTA — Not being “fully male” biologically is a major point of insecurity and sometimes self-loathing and dysphoria for FTM trans people. What’s worse, it’s not something they can “fix”. 

If you want an example of how bad dysphoria can get, there are numerous cases where MTF trans people have literally cut off their own genitals because they couldn’t afford surgery, or cases where FTM trans people have bound their chest so tightly that it caused serious damage. 

As such, this kind of reminder, even as a joke, can be extremely painful. It doesn’t matter that they brought up sucking dick as a joke; you took it to a very specific place—namely calling the trans guy out for the one thing he just cannot change.

You’re not a raging asshole or anything, but it was insensitive in a sort of uneducated way. So you should apologize, and not simply to keep the peace, but because it’s the right thing to do."

You don't need to get to know him better, especially since he's only been on the scene a couple of months. And telling him to politely back-off isn't AH territory. It's setting a boundary.

He sounds like an extrovert who makes friends with everyone. That can be difficult to deal with if you have depression and aren't someone who wants to talk 24/7 about everything and nothing. It doesn't make him a bad person, just different.

Getting along doesn't mean you need to be best friends. Be civil and make an attempt at occasional polite conversation. If your mother wants more than that, she needs to get a reality check."

I think that he sucks for being inconsiderate of you—for waking up early and then stomping around your room for hours, making lots of noise, etc. I think you can reasonably ask for him to cut that crap out, because it isn’t fair to you. If he wants to wake up at 5 AM, then he can leave the room and let you sleep.

That said, if you’re living with another person, you have to make accommodations. You can’t tell a fellow adult when they can and can’t wake up. I also hate that you’re framing this like some kind of weird mental illness Olympics—“I have depression and you should accommodate me!” “Oh yeah? Well I have anxiety, so YOU should accommodate ME!” Neither one of you is more or less deserving of special treatment than the other, and you’re going to have to learn how to coexist. Get some earplugs or a white noise machine.

It wasn’t cool of your ex wife to act that way last year, but you don’t have to respond in kind. 

Ultimately, the smoothest your relationship with your ex wife goes, the better it is for your daughter. 

Don’t think of it as doing a favor for your ex, think of it as being thoughtful of your daughter. She probably does want to see both her parents as much as possible, especially on a special day like Halloween.

If you've got to move on, you've got to move on, and don't feel bad about it. This happens with bands. Make sure he knows it's about availability, and nothing personal, but expect him to get upset, it sucks being let go.

dolj10,NTA- sounds like you have two babies. I’m sorry girl.

dolqgf,NTA you should have healthy boundaries.
dolr76,NTA I am a guy who when I was young thought it would be nice to have a sister. Some people just suck though. Live your good life and do what you can to forget this person.
dolsuc,NTA she is not sharing the room or being considerate of you. Tell her to head to the library if she’s going to be up at the middle of the night.
dolyxk,NTA. You shouldn’t be paying for pets you don’t own.
dom0df,[deleted]
dom1ce,YTA. She’s vegan for a reason so why would you expect her to cook non-vegan food? I’m also vegan and flat-out refuse to cook meat/dairy/whatever for my guests. They can eat what I cook or eat before they get here.
dom2z8,NTA. Move out asap
dom39z,"The dog is not the problem. The lack of training, and the codependent relationship she has fostered with her dog is the issue. You have an irrational level of anger that you are mistakenly channeling at the dog. You say that your relationship with your sister is strained, then you go on and talk as though the \*only\* reason for that strain is a dog that you talk about as though he's a narcissistic criminal mastermind.

You blame the dog WAY too fucking much and your anger is with your sister, but you are directing it at an animal. Again, the dog is NOT the problem. The way your sister treats the dog, and behaves as an owner is the problem. I'm sure there are many other issues that you specifically have with your sister.

ESH. You're an asshole for having this level of anger at a dog. Your sister is an asshole for not taking better care of her pet (which includes training, and instilling him with a healthy sense of attachment and independence)."
dom6zx,"NTA. You stated a boundary, she ignored it. You have no social obligation to take an item you don’t want and specifically warned this person that you would not take."
dom9qu,"NTA

No one should add a pet to a household without getting permission from everyone involved."
dom9yn,"NTA, that information is confidential and he's just going to have to live with that. I suggest you quit the orchestra asap and maybe even distance yourself from your bf (or at least his family) until it all blows over."
domavf,"NTA, spending time with your mom is entirely a valid reason, especially with her birthday being there. He's being a child about it."
dombdh,YTA! Sounds like they overlooked you by accident and are trying to fix it. God forbid they forget the daughter's older sisters friend from college who lives 100s of miles away when planning her party.
domc73,"YTA

You’re in an exclusive relationship. Delete the app. 

If I were dating someone still using something like tinder my first thought is they are cheating, thinking about it, or actively searching."
domcnd,"Weirdly enough, I've had something similar happen to me. Maybe they were feeling salty that you didn't wanna date them or something, but if you're gonna talk shit about something on social media, at least make it private. they're way more of an asshole than you. I'd suggest just easing out of this friendship. No need for a confrontation. NTA"
domewn,"It's not a lie, you will be out of town. This is not strange for a college student and the manager should understand that you would be at home during the holidays."
domgjy,NTA- but it was a dick move for her to put you in that position. Honestly you were made a middle man and I don't think you'd be an asshole either way if you let him use the money or not.
domm4j,YTA seriously get your key ready before you get out. She's not an asshole for keeping the front door locked. People have a right to look out for their safety.
dommnl,NAH. You're right to pissed off but maybe she can't help the snoring etc.
dommz4,"You'd only be TA if you are rude about it. If she can't handle the fact that not everyone likes everyone, that's on her."
domnup,"NAH and she doesn't seem that bothered by it. At worst she might get something similar but as you're siblings that's kinda cute too. 

Tbh I'm mostly just confused because what the fuck is a tattoo party? I've never heard of such a thing."
domx63,NTA It stops being a nice gesture the moment they don't give a shit about your rejection.
don189,"NTA she is your family too, you cant make your mother have a relationship with her any more than she can stop you having one. Get to know your sister."
don8ou,If she asked for feedback obviously NTA but this post leads me to believe you said it in a way that would be taken as asshole-ish.
donawn,She can't help get it back and you know it won't be good for her mental health.  NTA
donbdf,"I’ll rather let them find it out themselves. As engaging in office politics is not my cup of tea.

Some people might appreciate your advice, while others might think you’re one of the “rumour spreaders”. Very grey area I would say..."

If they were dumb enough that you had the only copy of an essential manual then that's on them."
dondk7,"NTA. If they take your stuff again and again, even by accident, they are unreliable. That would be reason enough for me to look for someone else."
dongmu,"YTA- 10pm is not an acceptable time to be loud. Other people are trying to sleep.  I would be so furious if a roommate was being loud at 10 (whether intentional or not). Saying ""well they have to wake up later than me"" is the most juvenile defense I’ve heard today.  You need to be more respectful to your roommates. You talk too loud. So either find a way to talk quieter or have the video call earlier in the day."
donjoh,"NTA

You aren't being unreasonable expecting someone who booked accommodations to at least be able to access the reservations so you can find it. She locked herself out of a seldomly used email and took screenshots and didn't check if she could read the language. That's shitty planning that's inconveniencing everyone."
donln4,"YTA, do your research first, polish people don't need visas to stay in the UK lol"
donlrv,"NAH because you're both hurting in different ways but I think you were in the wrong to express your anger at your sister being upset. 

Just as it's OK that you wanted nothing to do with your birth parent, it's also OK that your sister did want to get to know her and it's OK that your sister felt upset that she died (and it's OK that you didn't feel upset). 

What's not OK is lashing out at your sister for having her own feelings different to yours. I think you owe her an apology for that."
donoas,"NTA, tell them to f off! This could have been handled differently without publicly humiliation. You deserve better!"
dons8l,"NTA

I think it sounds like a lot of fun! Let the rest of the people enjoy prom for once, but I would invite everyone just to not exclude anyone like the organizers seem to be doing with the nominations."
donyre,"NTA 
Your friend was being really irresponsible leaving her parents leaving her and wondering about her well being. Also, she put you and your father in a very strange and uncomfortable situation without you even knowing what was happening.  Your friend should be apologizing to you, your father and her parents.  Sometimes doing the right thing is uncomfortable and you may lose friends over it. Don’t worry as you get older you’ll probably never talk to half of these younger friends again anyway!"
donyyl,"Was his profile picture his face or was it sent to you in a private chat? If you showed them a private photo then YTA. If it’s public, on his profile then NTA."
donzls,"Your friends are idiots

NTA"
doo9hz,"NAH. You might, however, want to leave him a text that is a little bit more gracious than saying you are uncomfortable in his home, which sounds like the fault is with him. There really isn't any fault here, so maybe something like, "" hey, got a lift home because I knew I'd have stuff to do in the morning, but it was good seeing you"" might be a more socially graceful exit."
doobeo,NTA how are you to provide special needs care when you had no idea the kid was special needs
doodiw,"NAH - Your hesitance is understandable, and his openness is admirable. 

If this is a dealbreaker for you, it's a dealbreaker. That's respectable, as much as it's respectable that this guy is potentially going to be hurt that it's a dealbreaker. Sometimes in respecting ourselves, hurting other people is unavoidable.

Personally, the drugs would also be a warning sign to me - I'd want to know if that was still a thing, and what they were doing about it, before deciding to make this person my full time partner.

That said, as you're entering the gay community I think it's going to be really important to make sure the information you have on safe sex, HIV and other STIs is up to date and sound. At the end of the day, there's no such thing as fully safe sex - only safer sex, and the things you do to make sure that sex is as safe as possible.

IMHO, a guy who is aware of his HIV status, is medicated and knows his viral load, and is willing to discuss safe sex and what precautions to take to protect himself and his partner, is a much safer choice than some of the options - for example, someone who might claim they're clean but hasn't been tested for ages, or is perhaps reluctant to use condoms etc."
doofsw,NTA fuck homophobes
doogsj,This feels like ether a shit post or a set up
doohmn,"YTA. You got *invited* to the party. They did not exclude non Hindu coworkers, they planned a party for everyone. Seriously, what kind of an AH are you if you report them?

You are the person the expression ""you must be really fun at parties"" is all about."
dooi4w,"NAH

But you're all idiots. Why on earth did you cosign an agreement for a place you don't live in? Why did you vouch for a guy you don't even know at your own workplace?

If you end up having to pay his rent and/or your reputation suffers because he doesn't come into work then it's all on you.

Mental health is a massive thing though and he should be able to get paid sick leave if a doctor signs him off as being genuinely not okay. That's not a long term solution but it could give him a month to get his shit together and come back to work fresh."
dookg6,"NTA.

Much like sex, you're allowed to change your mind right up to and even during doing drugs. Your friends should never have pressured you into such a big deal (and yes, smoking weed for the first time is a big deal), and they handled it poorly when you unsurprisingly bailed.

Edit: I wouldn't be too worried about it. Personal weed use does not carry a penalty higher than confiscation in most places."
doopid,"ESH (except for Katie).

Your friend’s ‘joke’ was awful. Pranking somebody by pretending to be an assailant and jumping out of the bushes is really messed up.

You kind of suck for blaming Katie for what sounds like a pretty aggressive burst of adrenaline. You know how on planes, they always say to put your oxygen mask on before helping others around you? This is kind of like that—in that moment, Katie’s first priority was getting out of danger. She thought that someone was trying to attack her, so the flight-or-fight kicked in."
dooqyq,"NTA. 

Your friend owes you money and you want it back. That's enough to be pissed over."
dop3ro,"NAH (You aren't and for the sake of innocent til proven guilty your SO isn't either)

You have concerns that you are completely legitimate in wanting to voice, but the timing is kind of bad."
dopdc4,"ESH I don’t think you should have went right out and called her an asshole for making the bed, you could have calmly said “hey I’m actually gonna go back to bed after I take the dogs out”, it sounds like you immediately got defensive and you set the tone for the conversation.

But I also think it’s a ridiculous concept that you can only ever sleep in the bed! I wouldn’t care what she says, it sounds controlling and if I want to go back in bed I will. I’d actually probably be petty and buy myself a small bed😂"
dopdt4,NTA. Sounds like you have no reason to go and a pretty good reason not to.
doplqq,"YTA.  It's not that hard to say something along the lines of ""I couldn't understand what was said because the teacher spoke too quickly.  I want to help but I don't know the directions.""  You could have asked the teacher to repeat the directions."
dopphg,"That seems different. You’re not celebrating an important event, you’re celebrating of being free from something that other people are still trapped in.

doprxp,NTA- parents who use their kids to get benefits are leeches and the practice is shameful
dopxdp,"YTA for not cooking your own food and taking someone else's.  Purchase groceries that work for your diet.  If you've been unable to eat for 26 hours, chili is NOT the right food to be eating."
dopxqv,"NTA But personally I would take it further.   Ask if SIL can do family dinner another weekend, you’d like to have a birthday dinner.   And to go back to your plan of going to the Greek place.  Make it clear you’d love her plan for another weekend but since this is your birthday you would like to decide on the plan."
dopzjs,"NTA. Your mom's boyfriend is a moocher. It's ridiculous to assume that someone who went grocery shopping for everyone can't get themselves a little snack, without bringing one for the entire family."
doq033,NTA. If you have brought up with him that the excessive screen-time use when you're together is an issue for you and he hasn't changed or even made an effort to he's clearly picked what is more important to him. Dump him.
doq1i3,"NTA. Two years together puts you in a serious relationship where developing a bond with your boyfriend's kids reflects a natural progression of that relationship. The fact that you are so involved can be nothing but a positive for everyone. Unfortunate that the ex doesn't see it this way. As a father to step-children, I can tell you treating his children as your own is the best possible way to bond with them."
doq2ta,"NAH

He seems unhappy and annoyed by something, not even necessarily by your behaviour.

This sounds more like you need to post it on r/relationship_advice or just really talk about it with him.

I wish both you lots of luck."
doq3yd,"NTA - too bad honestly i'm surprised you held it in. I would've exploded and said ""You're right, family don't pay for favors which i did for you everyday while i'm at your house. Maybe you should look into daycare and a maid?"" I wouldn't even offer to do it for free (after your paid work) anymore, i just wouldn't do it.

That hour that you take to yourself, it’s another hour she has to spend doing her full-time job, taking care of two young children. You’re not the only one working. How much free time do you think she has?

Actually, I’ve talked myself into YTA, if you can’t see that she’s probably also struggling. You need to figure out something to change your work schedule."
doqcsv,NTA - march down to the principles office and demand your instrument back. Have you involved your parents?
doqfqz,"NTA.

You weren't rude and stopped it before it escalated to something you might not be comfortable with.  If she was really innocently looking for online friends, she needs to learn the hard way to up her game.  Acting like a scammer means you will be treated like one."

doqmxm,"NTA.

Some street vendor get pushy as a sales tactic, if you aren't interested - ignoring them is usually the most effective way to handle it."
doqp74,"ESH. You \*did\* take that task on. Your reasons for not wanting to do it now might be valid to you, but your mom and stepdad don't share them, hence the ""difficult for no reason"" situation. From their POV, you agreed to cook, and now you're going back on that. 

The expectation that it has to taste good for everyone is one you've placed on yourself. They're not holding you to that, you are. 

Don't get me wrong, I can see your point of view, especially when it comes to past trauma they put on you. But this one meal won't solve your trauma nor will it solve hers, is what I'm thinking. I'm also thinking you guys have a larger issue than this one meal, and are using this as a proxy war kind of thing now. It is \*just one meal\*. How much time and energy will you invest in that, and is that really such a big ask? (I don't know the specifics, if your answer to this is ""yes"", then you do you)"
doqp92,"YTA

If the power went out they probably had problems with the electronic system used to print and process bills. You're saying you spent  time enough for eating and talking and you can't wait a bit for a bill? Also now you put the responsibility of following up on a bill on the restaurant. Just because you're ""a regular"" doesnt mean you get special privileges."
doqpsc,This post is really confusing but I’m gonna go with NTA
doqq3g,Both of you are absolute hot messes. Yikes. ESH.
doqq6w,YTA it's very normal for a mother to name her child after the baby's father.
doqqj9,"NTA. You didn’t agree to take on the debt in the first place, Jake did. And he did it in a shitty way too, hiding it from his wife and jeopardizing their future. 
The fact that he expected you to sort it all in one night?  And then fumes when you can’t/won’t? That’s just beyond the pale. 
You don’t owe this debt, full stop."
doqqz9,"YTA - Only for this

doqszh,"NAH. If you’re not bothered by having a safe, functional net on your property, I’d canvass your neighborhood and see if you can get others (particularly the parents whose kids use the hoop) to pitch in on a new, safer replacement to be installed next spring. I doubt people would be too upset about that."
doqtei,NTA. Why car rental places exist.
doquhz,"NTA

""Jesus Christ"" ""God Damnit"" ""Fucking Hell"" etc aren't ""Religious phrases."" In fact, they're considered blasphemous, they're using the Lord's name in vain."
doqxsh,NTA for not helping. You made every effort. But blocking her number seems very unnecessary.
doqxxn,"NAH

If you're close with the owner - maybe you could just essentially explain what you've explained here - and then give as much notice as possible and tell her you'll help her transition to the new person. Like, ""I don't want to burden you right now, and I want to be as helpful as possible, but I also can't put off this change any longer...""

It would be bad form if you just gave a standard two weeks notice given your relationship and your role - but you have every right to get out of a situation that's not working for you."
doqzi2,Easier to just state ‘no children’ across the board. That’s not a particularly unusual thing to do.
dor3ss,"NTA, sounds like the MIL has some really intense insecurities.  Your husband did nothing wrong."
dor8g8,"NTA, she shouldn’t expect you to call in sick to meet her needs. You’re paying your way literally.. 

Plus you could lose your job if anyone finds out you aren’t actually sick. Quite a selfish thing for her to insist tbh."
dor94a,"NTA, jeez.

You better hope this is just her being in a tired angry mood or something because those are some serious red flags. I've done exactly this a number of times and it seemed by far the best compromise to keep everyone happy"
