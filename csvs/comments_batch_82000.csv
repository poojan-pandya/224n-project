e30jpk,NTA- You have a duty to protect the kids. Period. At the end of the day you gave her a choice and she made that choice. I feel for her family but you have to take care of the kids and they deserve a sober mom.
e30js3,"YTA - It sounds like you’ve already played it for any friends who would “benefit.” The funeral where his family is getting closure would not be an appropriate repeat. 

You also mentioned depression and perhaps his state of mind when he created it versus how he may have felt later are different. You can’t prove how he would feel today but you do know how his family would feel. Err on the side of caution and don’t play it."
e30t90,"YTA because youdiscussed her going with you if you go, and now you're going andyou don't want to take her with you because you just don't want her there? So it's not even about the ride, it's about you not wanting her at the store she sells art at. So if she gets there through other means (an actual friend, public transport,...) you'll still be upset?"
e30ts6,"**YTA**. Christmas is not always about giving gifts and expecting something in return. Also, how dare you punish your niece and nephew just because their parents are not giving you something in return. 

However, I would need some more **INFO** about your niece and nephew's ages, because it would make a huge difference."
e30tvt,"NTA - you and your boyfriend have plans to visit your family. He goes back on your plans to ask if he can see his family instead. He gets upset because you let your parents know that his plans had changed. 

Your boyfriend is immature and needs to make up his mind"
e30u1y,"There isn't a magical rule that says that children aren't allowed in first class, it's just that few parents can afford to do so. I suspect that it was a new situation for everyone involved.

NTA, but expect death stares in the future."
e30ueh,"Nta

But you should talk to the rest of them about why. They might be just as sick of him."
e30uou,"I’m sorry but I’d have to say YTA for denying her the process to heal, you didn’t want to be with her and lied about it. Yeah it would of hurt but she would of had a chance to get over it and fled the pain instead of months later relapsing you’re lying and still feeling bad about it"
e30w31,NTA - especially considering all the circumstances I think it’s only right that you’re pre-warned before his arrival. I know I’d be scared personally
e31521,"NTA. If someone is consistently rude or hurtful to you as an adult you can choose not to see them, I can't see why this would be any different at 16. 

Say to your Mum 'I am not going because..' and leave it at that. It's up to her what she says to your aunt, but it's not really your concern."
e31i0i,"NTA. Sometimes it’s hard for people to notice if they’re having issues with personal hygiene— like BO or stinky breath. I think he’d rather hear it from a friend than from a stranger, and as long as you’re kind and not pushy about it."
e31jzy,"You should carry uninsured/underinsured coverage on your car. This means in the event there is a collision, YOU are covered.

He is an unsafe driver! He doesn't have insurance! What were you *thinking?* Of COURSE you should have reported it! Luckily no one was injured, but what about next time? My God man, he SHOULD NOT BE OPERATING A MOTOR VEHICLE!

If I get downvoted for this, ok, but an unsafe, uninsured driver is a risk to EVERYONE on the road. 

YTA"
e31mrk,"NAH

Whoever is missing their package will more than likely take steps to get a replacement or refund. 

You don’t need them and donating them is an excellent option."
e31nos,"NAH. There is nothing wrong with saying, “hey I love you, but I don’t have the energy or funds do to this round trip every weekend.” And he’s not an asshole for wanting to see you. Explain why you want to lessen the frequency of trips with care, and truly listen to how he feels about it as well. I do think you can meet in the middle though. Maybe you can keep making these weekly trips but he can pick up a part-time job to help you pay for gas? Or actually, physically, meet somewhere in the middle for an inexpensive date once or twice a weekend? 

On a side note, seriously do not try to stay in another student’s dorm long-term. If he school found out (which would be pretty likely in that kind of a living situation), your boyfriend could be in big trouble."
e31pya,"NTA, you should report the incident to HR"
e31sho,NAH  Your aunt asked for help and you said no.  You are an adult and she doesn't have to invite you to her house for Thanksgiving or any other day and you don't have to split wood for her.  You want thanksgiving without helping out then make your own or go out to eat.
e31srv,NTA he can listen to music in kitchen or back yard or head phones
e31szf,"NAH- but Ross, is that you? But seriously, if it’s not a huge sum of money, I’d just participate and earn some goodwill."
e31xkv,"This is a lot of info but a really simple answer. You’re NTA for the exact reasons you list. She’s a stranger to everybody. She could be a dude for all anybody knows. You’re sweet to care so much about dad’s online life. Keep it up, he needs it. Sheesh. And congratulations on your baby."
e3205a,NTA. You *have* got your priorities straight and she is not number 1 ( not should she be). She'll just have to get used to that.
e322f9,Whoever designed ring 2 is actually TA.  That thing is appalling.
e323mb,Tbf it's good you went back you shouldnt leave extra food for dogs while you're away I guess it wasnt loads as you didnt expect to be away for days at a time but cats can moderate themselves dogs dont always tend to do that.
e324jz,"NTA. 
My cat also yells at me when I don’t let him inside right away. He has an excuse though, like not having thumbs or a pocket to keep a key. What’s your roommate’s excuse?"
e325op,Nta. Just because a parent choose a new partner doesn’t mean you have to deal with ‘em.
e328u0,NAH- you'd been behaving strangely and you had her pills in your drawer...that's the natural conclusion to come to. And addicts aren't the most honest about their drug use. They freaked out and that's only natural when you have a history of depression that they would think you could be self-medicating. You have the right to be upset but you can see why they thought you would.
e3297d,"NTA, do it. Controlling abusive people need to be taken down a notch"
e32jvq,"NTA

She'll get over it when she needs you to do her an unreasonable favor again. :) Trust me."
e32k33,"NTA. That's a pretty significant fever, and there's a good chance the others may have caught it and just aren't experiencing symptoms yet. Holidays are all about sharing, but not when it comes to illnesses lol."
e32num,NTA Entirely reasonable to watch your cats weight.
e32plb,"ESH.

Is it too late for Jane to beg Jolene not to take her man?"
e32q3u,"YTA - I was struggling with this one because I know you were trying to do the right thing by being honest, but you knew he was grounded and you let him go and then you told on him - that wasn't right. You either should have said ""no"" or let him go and kept it between the two of you. Now you're stuck in the middle :("
e32x09,"NAH except for your mom.

It is not your wife of her family's fault that your mom changed plans at the last minute. You should have honored the plans that were already in place."
e32ynd,"YTA - Sometimes it takes time to process the sharpness of insults because of the adrenaline in the moment.  Laughter is a common reaction to being uncomfortable and doesn't always mean everything is okay.

What you said was disrespectful."
e32yvk,"NTA. It’s not your job to support your friends lifestyle. It sounds like you have an unspoken arrangement, so it’s time to tactfully revisit said arrangement; ie “I’m trying to cut back,” “Funds are a little low,” “I’ll buy specifically for you next time I’m home, but I’m going to need the cash up front.”"
e330b3,"I kinda lean towards YTA. You keep saying for them to “get a room” well they have one and they are using it. And jolly well good for them. Telling them that they shouldn’t have sex when you are home is wrong. You could have just said “ Hey look, the walls are a little thin in this house. My room is right next to your room.”
 I get it’s weird for you OP but honestly your parents being so into each other is kinda endearing to me. And good for them.
 Also, your dad is right, you were disrespectful. You don’t get to dictate to them if you get another sibling.

Edit: spelling."
e331a9,"NTA. The idea that you, an intern, one of the lowest paid person in the company (if you get paid at all), should use your money to buy something for one of the higher paid people in the company is profoundly stupid. Not only should YOU not get your boss a gift, none of the interns should."
e331op,[deleted]
e3348o,NTA. She agrees then lies for an extended period of time before revealing you cant do it your way and your unable to cancel and now must pay for pictures you didnt agree to. Shows she had little respect in that situation.
e337x1,"NTA, you're right to stand up against a bigot, even and especially among your own. But INFO, does the rest of your family share her opinion?"
e33d0s,"NTA...except why did you let your girlfriend put a FOUR YEAR OLD in timeout for an hour and a half? That’s absolutely insane.

Update to OPs Update:  I hope there’s a timeframe attached to this new arrangement.  What if she never feels better about it?  I think that’s a bad call.   Glad you’re going to look into grief therapy though."
e33dr9,"NTA - if you hadn't put that money into the house whose to say of your mother would have had it?

Your siblings will disagree, but just because you are ""somewhat well off"" it does not mean you should be losing out"
e33nw1,"YTA. It's still a very personal experience, even if someone doesn't keep it shrouded in secrecy. The fact that she advocates for reproductive rights isn't ""bragging,"" it's advocating. 

The fact that she's proud of the fact that she has reproductive rights and was able to exercise them is also not ""bragging."" It's *exercising the reproductive rights that she's proud and fortunate to have*.

Like damn. That's not something for you to share with other people."
e33nx8,"esh and you should stand up for yourself instead of missing out on all the food. You already did everything, you might as well enjoy the good part.  For Christmas, say no to cleaning- it’s simple"
e33qnf,"YTA. She should be going to a therapist or the psych ward if you’re that concerned, not a church. Seriously? Especially if she’s not religious previously."
e33rrm,"NTA your wedding your rules, but be prepared for the fact she might not want to come."
e33svb,"YTA

having him bail on his pre-planned family visit would make him a bigger asshole (to them) than he would be by 'bailing' on you to stick to the plan"
e33uul,"NAH about the dream.  Good to use the  energy in a way you and wife enjoyed.  

Y T A, in my opinion  for letting your friend in on the secret."
e33wzn,"Holy crap NTA. You would be TA if you didn’t. A lot of times women don’t feel comfortable or safe speaking up, especially when it’s someone in a position of power. Not everyone is capable of it, or has been conditioned not to. It’s our responsibility as people to stand up for each other."
e33x5h,"NTA. If she’s not in the photos AT ALL, you don’t have to take them down."
e3402q,"NTA, its not like you are even living there, and you are 26, you are supposed to make a living and create a life for yourself not clean up after your mothers misstakes"
e3424n,"YTA

Consideration is consideration... Do you really have to be told to walk slower to stay by her? Honestly.

INFO: what do you gain by walking faster than her?"
e343p1,NTA She wants to be the center of attention. I had an employee that used to crochet during meetings. At first it bothered me but she got all info needed and remembered better than I did most of the time. Go forth and crochet!
e345ja,"NTA. You're partner is 100% the asshole, especially since you always spend holidays with his family."
e3473i,"This might be controversial...but at 4 months old most babies look the same and are not easily identified. This might just be my opinion but pictures of me at 4 months old, I would not be able to look at it and know it was me. Obviously I would know what MY baby looks like in a lineup of a million babies but I wouldn't be able to pick YOUR baby out, especially if I met your child when they were 10+. So I'm going to go with NAH because it is your baby therefore your choice. But I do think you may be overthinking it a little."
e347hj,[deleted]
e34971,"NTA. It’s common to pay more if you have a bigger room/better room than everyone else. In the house I lived in with my roommates we all paid different amounts based on room size, and especially with having an own bathroom it’s very reasonable!"
e34b1z,"Going against the grain to say YWBTA.  No matter what the mom's mental illnesses and struggles may be, it is inappropriate for you to clean her house without permission.  Now don't get me wrong, I don't think that what you've described is right or healthy, but kicking in someone's door, going through their things, and changing them around is not okay.  Your choice in the matter is not what the state of someone else's home is, it is whether or not you want to stay there at all - if I were you, I wouldn't agree to it."
e34fae,"NTA, he’s a huge part of your life and you shouldn’t have to pretend he doesn’t exist if it comes up organically"
e34hle,"You may have to ask for help or even assign help (eg: you do the turkey, hubby does some sides, etc)... or you may have to have a holiday blow up and go on strike.

We normally host, and we work out in advance which guests are coming and what they’re bringing. I’ll do the main (smoked turkey, ham, whatever) and others will do the sides. 

No single person should have to do everything.

NTA."
e34mmb,"NAH, but it's probably best to accept them and then replace them when they break, which can happen as soon as you'd like."
e34nch,"While I believe you are in the right here....it strikes me if you follow through it's one of those many, little ways that a couple kills all the love out of a marriage."
e34q9e,"I don't think you'll be an asshole, but I also don't think it's a good idea.  I'd talk to the host parents before confronting the host sister.  Something tells me that she will NOT take it well if you do."
e34s2d,"A tip, separate paragraphs for easier reading.

Nta. You don't have to go. Also I would tell your parents because they should know."
e34tb8,"NTA, but ask yourself, are you his gf or his mum?"
e34tt1,"NTA. Your sister needs to grow up. First she should not assume  she is entitled to your stuff based on her or anyone's analysis of your current degree of use of stuff. This sounds like a preteen spat over last years toy. Second as your sister she really should not befriend your ex-husband out of respect for your feelings, especially immediately after divorce. Third if she does befriend your ex-husband she should sure as sh*t realize that he cannot speak for your stuff. And the ex is having boundary issues, and hasn't fully understood the meaning of ""ex"""
e34wis,"NAH but you should make it up to her somehow. Not your fault your dogs got sick and I’m guessing she doesn’t hold it against you, but yah, it did kinda mess up thanksgiving so maybe invite her over to dinner at some point or send her a bottle of wine with a pic of your dog and a card that says “sorry we are a bird and you didn’t” :)"
e34ybi,"NTA. 

Your mom is breaking your family apart. She chose to marry and have kids with a man she wasn’t in love with, and in doing so she risked the happiness of her husband and her children. There’s no excuse for that, whether she was still in the closet or not. 

She cheated on your dad, and your dad is a more devoted parent than she is. Go with your gut."
e353lk,"Majorly YTA

>I don't think it's his role to meddle in this 

If it's not his role to meddle, why is it his role to buy the cigarettes?"
e356go,"NTA - it's your dog and you taught it in a way that was convenient to you. If the signals are easy to pick up, then it's not really a problem as you can show anyone who needs to the signs. Why would random strangers be commanding your dog anyway?"
e359k8,"NTA. Your father is an asshole, excluding a kid from a fucking wedding is literally pointless."
e35arx,"So you are in one line, your gf is in a line, and your wife is in a line? 🤔"
e35c06,"NAH 

holy high school, Batman"
e35dvy,"NTA. I cannot believe you let yourself get railroaded into a day you didn't want in the first place. It's YOUR special day, not your families. They were totally out of order and you absolutely deserve to have a beautiful day. Get it booked!"
e35iec,"NTA

A hypothetical offer of eggs made a few years ago to a third party is not a firm offer made in current circumstances to the person who needs the eggs. Your previous possible willingness, if it was brought up at all without you there, should have been presented as a possibility to follow up, not as something you'd promised last week. They did not have the right to commit you to that hypothetical willingness.

Even if you did make an actual offer years ago, it's now. You can change your mind for many reasons. Yes, that change might upset people, but it's your right to decide whether and to whom you donate eggs."
e35l3b,"If this is true, NTA. Your GF is a massive asshole for putting your kink out on social media."
e35muj,"YTA and it may be illegal. Your aunt works for that person under the assumption of trust. Rich people are extremely cautious about their privacy. You violated their privacy and effed with the trusted relationship between your aunt and her employer.

Did you take the video down?

Also, thinking that just cuz everyone on reddit does it, doesnt mean that it's legal. There are hundreds of illegal videos on Reddit.

Further, you have NO idea what was identifiable. What if they had one-of-a-kinds? That's a great way to identify stuff. What if they had stuff that was precious yet highly stealable?

**An OUNCE of common sense** woulda helped you in this situation."
e35vik,"YTA

You expected everyone else to wait 40 minutes and eat what you admit was “cold dinner.”

Perhaps you should host if you don’t want to travel?

I have been the one stuck hosting holidays for many years.  If someone is not there when dinner is served, they get leftovers.  That’s how it is."
e35w6k,"Obviously NTA. The gf is manipulative and has probably convinced your friend of going her way, against you. You're just being a good friend imo"
e35ygw,[deleted]
e35z0g,I’m gonna say NTA it’s your kid. You get to decide who kisses your kid and who doesn’t. He shouldn’t have let her kiss your kid especially with how nasty you say she is.
e35z0y,"NAH.  Tell him that you’re concerned for his health.  If need be, offer to show him the relevant information."
e3612b,"NTA but your mum and dad are.  Why in the name of god would your mother defer to your father's decision?  They're not married any more, you and her had a financial plan organised and you don't need any input from him.  She needs to shiny up her spine and make decisions for herself. It has nothing whatsoever to do with him. 

Your father sounds like a. A-grade arsehole. She's well rid of him. And no,  you're not TA for cutting him out of your life."
e361wp,"NTA but honestly it's easier to identify people with behaviour you disagree with and ignore/avoid them... than it is to lecture them into some sort of change. You don't get to dictate her social etiquette, but you can stay clear of her if she doesn't meet your standard. You might have pressed the issue more than necessary.

One time I was driving around with a friend who threw a can out if my window into the lawn of a business we stopped near. I insisted she get out and pick it up. Unacceptable! I concede that I wasn't being nice. 

Maybe our actions had an impact but, as I've gotten older, I now consider it a waste of time to try and impact the casual friend in this way."
e361yr,"NTA
You can and should share this information. Now your coworker has leverage to get a raise that she probably deserves."
e361z7,"I think this isn’t really about the gifts fully. You say you’re parents don’t care as much about your daughter as they do about your son, and that makes them assholes.  Idk how you’d go about trying to bridge the gap and get to the bottom of why they don’t seem to care but I think it might be important to do so before daughter gets older and starts to feel a cold shoulder from them.

NTA"
e362qa,YTA.  There is no way this is going to damage your car.  Cars are constantly used with uneven weight distribution.  My husband weighs 215ish pounds and constantly drives around by himself.  Those weight limits are very likely to be EXTREMELY conservative.
e363j0,NTA. Innocent kids don’t have anything to do with their parents mistakes. WTF is wrong with your family??
e366d0,"YTA, this is a completely valid arrangement that the person with the biggest room pays more."
e368w8,"NTA, not sure why he's trying to guilt trip you into not going"
e36dlq,">*""I told her she dishonored our agreement""*

For goodness' sake.


Surely this is a shitpost? Nobody **REALLY** interacts with the person they love and want to share life with, in these sorts of terms?


If this story is true, YTA."
e36f3j,"NTA. Dude, your folks sound possessive and crazy af."
e36g9a,NTA. Knowingly letting people eat recalled food is unprofessional and unnecessarily lazy. You aren’t wrong to refuse to work somewhere that would do something like that.
e36g9v,"NTA. If you really have asked that many times and it is never going to stop, you kinda either be her maid or do what you're doing. I'd do the same"
e36s03,NTA he could've informed you earlier to cancel of they had been a bit sick for the last couple of days.
e36tax,"NTA for one reason- the kid’s mom said NO, so why in the world would it be okay now for the child to use someone else’s phone?"
e36ukk,ESH if for no reason than I wasted ten seconds reading this trivial junior high garbage
e36uly,"I think giving a dog away for free can be risky if you dont know the person - they could be used as a bait dog for dog fighting or something. A person willing to pay for a dog is more likely to treat it well imo. That should be your reasoning behind a price, not wanting the money. 
NTA in this instance, but don't get another animal until you are willing to commit to it for its life."
e36xp6,"NAH - whilst you’re not the arsehole for asking him to push the button, I can understand his annoyance. If you would have justified your asking him to do it by saying something like “oh sorry I thought this was my floor, can you press ground floor for me please” any anger from him would have been less justified

However the use of just the term “ground floor please” sounds on the surface of it like there is some expectance of him to press the button for you, and he probably interpreted it as an entitled demand, rather than a polite request. IMO, just a misinterpretation of the situation"
e36xsf,NAH. It’s doubtful that kids that age are really going to notice that they received fewer gifts - they’re just going to be excited about the ones they do receive.
e36z7g,YTA for texting something like this at the last minute. Cancelling on family on a holiday should at least be done through a telephone call so you can explain what’s going on thoroughly.
e371fa,"Yta, keep drama off the internet and stuff. General rule of thumb, not just because you’re making stuff public, inviting people not involved to get involved, but also putting things out there you might not be able to take back because they’re documented"
e376qu,NTA - She shared it so she should have expected some shape or form of a response and you told her the truth. It seems like a bad situation so you told her.
e377z9,"NTA. The child is 2. He is altogether too young to be exposed to the dismembering and evisceration of an animal. It is a scary, messy, bloody thing that no child needs to see until they are old enough to understand that meat is animals and aren’t afraid of the sight of blood or sharp implements."
e37aau,"NTA

Do your parents realize how much drama having Jacob and his father there could cause? Asking someone else to use their social function as a way to try and force a reconciliation is unbelievably inappropriate. Tell your parents that it's a bad idea to do this for a lot of reasons. If they really want to insert themselves in this other family's drama, then they can invite them over at some other time and not risk them blowing up your annual holiday party."
e37age,"ESH 

You reneged on your promise. They didn't get (everything) you asked for. Doesn't everything have tổ be shipped into alaska? I thought supplies were relatively limited unless you order with the next shipment"
e37ayf,"NAH

As a parent of a sixteen year old, I worry when my kid gets hurt. I probably wouldn’t have gotten the neighbor involved, but I would have said that if your eye looked worse the next day, you’d be going to the doctor. You’re at the age where you’re wanting a level of independence, and I get that, but your mom wants to make sure you’re not injured too badly."
e37bnx,"YTA, sorry.  When your boss at work is sick do you still expect a paycheck?  Yes, you do.  Just like your sitter should be paid even if you're sick.  She's providing an agreed upon service and has bills to pay, even if you're sick.  You're an employer, not a relative, not a friend."
e37eub,nobody wants to hear shit like that in a time of panicking/being frantic/the last minute. joking or not i wouldn’t have said it lol. but of course she was panicking so of course her reaction could vary. torn between a very soft yta and NAH
e37kq4,"NAH

Tell your brother the entire truth, that your son doesn't want a relationship with him, and you lied because you thought he would come around. 

Hopefully, he will forgive you and understand how his nephew feels. I know it seems likely he will still be angry, but at least he has the truth."
e37ml1,"NTA - Its a family ""relic""(???) putting in a young childs room puts it at huge risk."
e37v3m,"NTA.

Used TVs sell for *a fraction* of their retail price. You wouldn’t have gotten a lot of money for it anyway."
e37v3g,"NTA, but it sounds like it was a bad idea to move out there. You don't mention your bf standing up for you, so I'm going to assume he doesn't. If you stay in this relationship you can expect to deal with this everytime you interact with his parents. Get out now."
e37xy5,"YTA

Your younger daughter needs to be assessed IMMEDIATELY. It's not normal nor typical to have these reactions to things like the dark or heights. That being said, there is no way she needed both of you. If you have conditioned her to expect EVERY TIME SHE IS UPSET mummy and daddy drop EVERYTHING to comfort her, that's just poor parenting. At 6, she should be self-soothing. You need a new therapist, yesterday! 

I am so upset for your eldest daughter. You have done her a serious injustice and it's obvious you favor your younger daughter over her. You are being unfair, and you don't even recognize it. Get your younger daughter an assessment, and a new therapist. 

Apologize to your eldest daughter. Do better."
e383uh,"YTA.  

> fiancée is upset because I proposed in public, even though a couple months back she mentioned how that would give her pressure & anxiety.

Like.. duh."
e3869q,YTA.   Your grandma and aunt are only looking out for your best interests.   Not sure why that offends you.   Sounds like you need someone to be looking out since your mom isn’t holding you accountable for your success in school.
e3879h,NAH. You’re broken up - you are no longer obligated to communicate with him for any reason.

e38t9u,"NTA, if your mom isn’t capable of watching him by herself, HIS mom needs to take responsibility of her own offspring.   Also., They are the assholes for trying to make your dad stay home with him."
e38wwk,"NTA, your partner’s family shouldn’t be treating you like that, and it’s completely reasonable to not want to visit with people that make “jokes” at your expense and treat you like shit for being better educated than them."

You are not ""technically the reason"" for his speeding. He made the choice to take you to the airport, show up late, and speed. 

He's the a-hole for expecting that you would pay his ticket though."
e39enu,"ESH. While he was wrong for saying all those things, if your brother was truly one of your closest friends you shouldnt have gave him shit over a pack of gum and some snacks. Me and my siblings never act like this"
e39inp,"Giving them money won’t do anything, they’ve proven to have very poor money management skills. The fact that they’re staying in a motel instead of renting a small apartment (which would be a ton cheaper) is a huge red flag.

1) you sounds super dismissive of your wife, like you think she’s stupid and you’re high and mighty. you want to get rid of the help so “she’ll do something” but you shouldn’t be delegating, you’re not in charge of her.

2) if she is not contributing, you have every right to be frustrated, and things need to change. she’s being lazy and you are totally justified in what you expect from her.

e3apzb,"NTA. It sounds like this woman has made little to no effort to develop a relationship with you, so why would you feel a familial connection with her? I think you should talk to your dad and tell him how you feel--that your stepmom doesn't seem to have mad much of an effort to actually connect with you other than yelling or getting mad, and it's made you feel conflicted. Even say you would be open to more of a relationship with her (if you are), but if this woman has lived with you for FIVE years and made this little effort, it doesn't sound like she really cares. But people can always change. Also, I do think it's reasonable to tell your dad that it makes you very uncomfortable to be in the same room as your stepmom while she dances, and say you'd prefer to leave the room if she ever engages in that.

Something like buying tickets to a show you know they want to see and offering to go together? Or those cheesy fake coupons for babysitting or a day trip to the beach? Might need to brainstorm on that a bit, but I think it'd go a long way to try to replace ""gifting"" with some other thoughtful gesture so they know it's not a matter of you being lazy or not caring."

Instead of framing it as better for both of you, have an honest conversation about your own feelings.  And give her an opportunity to tell you how she feels.

Secondly, you've made your daughter's tuition dependant on C accepting her apology. As the fees are something between you and your daughter that's not appropriate especially as C seems to be the issue here.

Your niece is very aware of her loss. Her classmates have parents, but she doesn’t. She made herself vulnerable and asked to call you Mom. It would be a gift, not only to her, but to the memory of your sister. You can’t replace her, obviously, but you can take up the helm of raising her daughter like she would have.

In the three times it took you to say “watch the tea” louder and louder, you could have walked over and moved your child away.

Just because they’re family does NOT mean you have to be kind if they’re not extending the same courtesy. I can’t imagine that shunning is doing wonders for your mental health either, and it’s in no way your responsibility to gift them anything. 

If you want to try and keep in friendly contact with the kids, I understand wanting to buy them presents, but you’re also saving up to start a family (congrats by the way!) which is much more important IMO. You can always try to explain the situation to the kids when they’re older if you want a relationship with them, but unfortunately I don’t see your brother changing anytime soon and wouldn’t waste another dollar on him. It may be a little awkward if you come around with no gifts, but it’s awkward your brother put you in this position in the first place. 

So in conclusion, you wouldn’t be the asshole if you didn’t buy them gifts, but if it makes you feel better you can. I hope the situation gets better and have a great Christmas regardless.

e3m6g1,"NTA and I’m appalled by the amount of “don’t snitch” in this comments section 

Downvote me to hell, but smoking is an awful habit. It destroys your body and causes all kinds if health issues, plus it’s nasty. Cigarette butts are the most littered item in the world, ash trays stink, it makes your breath nasty, and second hand smoke is carcinogenic (it causes cancer). Furthermore, as a teenager, your brother is also stunting his growth and doing damage to his brain. He’s hurting himself. If he continues to smoke and picks up this habit, he cuts years off of his life and does quite a bit of damage to others because of secondhand smoke. Nicotine also does a pretty substantial amount of damage to developing brains. 

And that’s not mentioning that he lied to you, and broke the deal you had arranged. If he cannot meet the terms of his deal, then said deal shouldn’t be fulfilled. He smoked. That’s his fault and you’re NTA at all if you tell. You even gave him a 2nd chance. 

It’s good for your brother because it might make him stop and it illustrates that actions have consequences. 

But, seeing as I’ve got a brother, it feels obligatory to say you need to sit him down and have a real heart to heart about how nasty that stuff is and how badly it’s hurting him. Make it very clear he does not get another chance. Put the ball in his court and see if he fouls again. Not quite as extreme as telling on him and might accomplish everything without the blow up. 

Best of luck."

Nothing wrong here at all. He's being open and honest about his feelings.

>So I told him to stay in his lane.

Your boyfriend (1) expressed how he feels about this, open and honestly, and (2) acknowledged he cannot and should not tell you what to do in spite of his discomfort.

asking once is fine. but when you’re told the restaurant’s rules you should know that you’re putting your server in a very uncomfortable position by asking them to beg their bosses to break the established rules"
e3ogyf,"Nah, YTA the whole story is phony. 

1. Costco membership cards don’t have two names on them. Memberships can have two members but each member gets their own card with name and photo. You are not allowed to use someone else’s card. There are also age requirements to be a Costco member and if you want to be a membership co-signer you have to have the same street address of the main cardholder. So they came in with their dad’s membership card and no personal ID. Cashier did their job and nothing more.

2. When asked “why didn’t you talk to a manager” The OP said “there was no time to talk to the manager  between arguing with the cashier and getting kicked out by security.”  But then also says “mom was paying cash had no id or drivers license.” and “the cashier just ignored us.” So it wasn’t an argument, more like the two were just yelling at the cashier for doing their job because they had no valid id. And instead of talking to a manager, which would’ve been pointless since they have no id, they chose to sit there and yell at the cashier, who didn’t even engage them, until security came and took them outside.

The story changes from the cashier being abusive to the mom and the son yelling at the cashier for doing their job. If the mom had Id she could’ve gone to member services and gotten another membership card printed up. She shouldve gone home and gotten her ID.

The lesson here is that it takes a lot for fucking Costco security to throw you out. You have to do something to earn that kind of treatment."

Their bodies won’t process the water like that. They’ll need to pee around midnight from the water you have them a few hours before bed. You’re better off if you cut off water several hours BEFORE bed because they won’t have any waste to build up. If they sleep at eight, last cup of water should be at 5 with last chance to pee right before bed. Otherwise they’ll pee. But why are you letting them sleep in your bed if this is such an issue for you? Either they wear pull ups or they don’t sleep in your bed until they can sleep the night through without an accident. 

You let them push you around until you snapped. That’s on you and your lack of boundaries. The minute they started playing with the water, you should have taken it away. Same with the gummies. You let them make you angry until you snap, and because they know you won’t do anything they keep acting like that. You are, right now, the kind of person who would raise an awful terror of a child. Of course they don’t respect someone who lets them do whatever they want."

e3sw8n,NTA. You’re an adult and your first priority needs to be your partner and your son. You don’t have to feel guilty not extending an invitation to your home to someone who treats you all poorly. At some point there needs to be a conversation that you will no longer put up with his treatment of your partner.
e3sxtc,NTA. Your ex needs to be held accountable for paying child support for his child. Do what you need to do to ensure you get the money. He knows he owes it and is purposely screwing around to keep it from you.
e3t93k,"NAH. I think a lot of people are going to call you the asshole for calling him stupid. That wasn’t great and I think you know that. But I don’t think that tips you into asshole territory, I think it makes you human. I get that you feel frustrated because you think he should fight and that there is something worth fighting for, but if he is also dealing with depression he just might not have it in him. 

I deal with both chronic pain and major depression and I just don’t have the words to describe to someone who hasn’t had the experience the grinding ordeal that the day to day becomes. You are just so fucking tired and fucking *bored* by your own pain. I can completely understand how he could want to usher in a resolution to his glaucoma, just to be done with it.

 I know this isn’t what you want for him and I don’t blame you for feeling hurt. But he’s fucking tired and it’s his choice to make. You need to let him make it. There’s a peace that comes with accepting your fate. I’d advise you to look for that."

Snitching on him for having his phone out. Some might say that's a bit too far but honestly I would have done the same.

And then his friends yelled at you and stamped on your bag AND emptied it out? Yikes what the fuck, that isn't okay.

What you said was a bit extreme and there was no need to bring his weight into it, but considering their actions, I would say it's totally justified."

e3uaem,"NTA because I honestly do not understand why she would cry over you asking a pretty normal question.

e3vevj,NTA. You absolutely did the right thing. Some dogs just aren't meant to be around other animals or children and it sounds like Coco was one of them. There's nothing you can do about that but accept it. The breeder should have warned you about the possible temperament issues. I urge you to report them. Thank you for thinking of your sweet older dog and his comfort first. You sound like a wonderful pet owner who just got saddled with an animal they couldn't control.

e3viht,"Dude, more than just the Christmas tree, I am REALLY concerned about your budget here. How far above your means are you living that you make 150 THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR, and you can’t afford a $95 Christmas tree? You already have a tree and I think it was shitty your wife tried to guilt you by talking to your kid about it, so NTA there, but how are you referring to yourself as a “deadbeat” whose $5,000 vacation wiped them out, when you are making THAT MUCH MONEY. That is absolutely insane and I really think there’s a lot going on here besides just a tree."
e3vkd2,"NTA. This is really cold, but why would she think ""Her own family"" is the children of the woman who her husband was married to when she met him? Aka her husband's family who she never raised or much interacted with? 

Abandonment by definition requires an initial presence (you can't abandon someone you never knew). NTA. Unfortunate, but your father and his wife are the aholes here. 

Your father was wrong to tell his daughter you were coming to visit and never once ask you to come until it was almost too late."

03:00am is a pretty shitty time to be 'whispering' in the living room, that noise can carry through a quiet house and be very annoying.

He shouldn't be acting like a child and blame and guilt trip you for an argument he had with his wife, that's just pretty low,"
e3vty3,"NTA. I do it to my b/f all the time, as he will often do with me. Neither of us take offense at all. Sounds like he had issues with it because he felt like it was challenging him. Glad he’s your ex now, sounds like a jerk."
e3vusb,"NTA obvious favouritism if you ask me. Your stepfather left a note for you so therefore, it should he yours. Simple as that. Aldo, about the part about you stealing the name, your son was born 3 months ago, she was pregnant after that. You didn't steal the name."
e3vv09,"NTA, you warned them many times and they refuse to listen AND they dumped work on you def not the a-hole"
e3w2is,"NTA

She has the etiquette backwards. The person familiar with the group has the responsibility of introductions and staying close to the partner. 

Moreover, they also have the duty of providing the time limit to be spent. 

While you should check in equally from time to time, it’s not very much obligated. 

Also, it sounds like the minor “celebrities” are jealous that she has an independent partner. 

Sounds like she cares too much about outside opinions. And if she spent the entire time talking about you behind your back, then she doesn’t respect you."
e3w437,"NTA for storming out. You should have gotten the heads up. However, will you still get a good reference from him? Doubtful. He was most likely worried that you would take intellectual property with you and he wanted to protect that, but he went about it in a really shitty way."
e3wbqw,"NTA because damn. 'You could've done it just to be nice' sounds like guilt tripping, and he admitted it himself that it wasn't much so why make such a big deal out of it?

Communication is always a difficult thing to get right because people understand and react differently to everything. But if you apologised for how you phrased it and tried to explain yourself properly, and he was still fairly aggressive about the situation (which was a few unwashed dishes; why such a big response?) then he is the one with an issue here.

It's one of those situations where it may be just a small thing, but it's all about the lack of respect for you. Not massive disrespect, but the fact he's getting upset to that point, even after you tried making amends, just feels disproportionate.

I also get he was getting up super early to leave, but getting that mad about it just feels mean. All that was needed was a 'sorry, I thought you could do them in the morning because I needed to sleep' or something. It feels like immense guilt tripping.

I hope you feel better, and that the two of you can sort everything out."
e3wftk,NTA. you were upfront with her after you discovered her lie. she is definitely TA here.

e3wx1f,NTA she could be in serious physical trouble and needs to see a doctor.
e3xady,"NAH. This just seems like a normal chink in an otherwise good friendship. It seems to me that your friend might not understand that you are being truthful when you tell him you can’t hang out for the reasons you give. He probably thinks that you are giving excuses. But you have the right to say no to something if you don’t want to or if you can’t. 
I would try to talk it out next time you see one another in person. Explain to him that you aren’t lying and that you value his friendship, and he will eventually come around."
e3xbku,"YTA.

>The issue is that I see my child once a week now. We are close but I can tell he doesn’t really need me.

Do you really believe that? I know children in this situation, and they never stop wishing their parents would love them more. By the time your child is old enough to ""come live with you if he chooses,"" he'll choose not to, because he'll have worked out that he was never a priority for you.

If you want to improve your life, do it, but don't do it overseas."
e3xfd4,"NTA. It’s fine that he wants to hang with his friends and he should be allowed to do that, but leaving you alone for so long when you’re uncomfortable isn’t right. He can balance the two, spend some time with pals and some time with you. 

I feel like it’s just a case of men being emotionally unavailable, rather than him necessarily being an asshole. As your partner he should consider your feelings and wellbeing"
e3xi4i,"If your girlfriend's sweat is staining the sheets that badly after walking home from work, she needs a doctor not a shower."
e3xr7j,NTA you are not obligated to give people free rides...especially when they’re being assholes
e3xsd3,NTA. Find better friends. These people are rubbish.
e3xsu6,"So, I can see where you were coming from with this. 

Here’s my issue with execution, though. 

By your own admission, your employees got their asses kicked. 

When you told your employees what was happening and why, I doubt that they were feeling enlightened, educated, or more open minded. Most likely they were feeling resentful. Towards you, and towards the people they were already discriminating against. 

Under the assumption you weren’t just doing it to make them suffer something they’d only view as a punishment, and honestly wanted them to interface better with customers, NTA. I just think there could have been a better way to go around it. Like you said, they’re still pissed a week later."
e3xu1b,"It’s his xbox, you don’t have a right to it. YTA. Now maybe if you were gonna ask him nicely, maybe even offer to do something for him, he would give you the pin no problem. However allowing your parents to punish your brother for not giving the pin means he’s not gonna want to let you play at all. You don’t respect your brother or his property clearly."
e3xxti,"NTA, he's the parent and you're the child (albeit an older teen), he ought to be taking the initiative to make the plan."
e3y081,"Dude, she probably is having a PTSD-like response to this pregnancy  from her past experiences with two miscarriages. Her response to the trip isnt a matter of rationality or logic. She's scared.

You accept that shit wholeheartedly, and even play that CD on blast on the home stereo system. You are grateful that she tried. You shut up, sell the PSU, pony up the difference for the one you want, and get on with your life. 

Don’t fuck with Grandma."
e3ybu9,NTA. How old is she?
e3yg19,"NTA. He didn't put much effort into raising you without bullying, and you're still trying to keep the peace by getting him a gift. You don't have anything to worry about."
e3yild,NTA you have every right to be uncomfortable about this. Just be calm when you approach this as it seems as though she doesn’t have many friends.
e3ylre,This isn't really a matter for AITA. This is deep deep territory that you need to be discussing with a therapist or a priest or a family psych.
e3ypz5,"NAH Although as a general rule it is to be assumed 230am is much too late to be texting anyone but as you say you 'saw' him online it is not entirely your fault.

Hes not wrong for being upset with you waking him and now has made it clear he doesnt want texts that late."
e3yr5z,"ESH. You don’t buy something for one child and nothing for the other, but you need to realize PDQ that your kid isn’t better than your nephew. She may be smart, but if she’s being mean and nasty and calling names, you certainly haven’t taught her to be kind."
e3yssy,"NTA

Thought this was you proposing right before he did.

If all she was yapping about was how you showed him all the options, then she must be real insecure. All you did was help a friend and even told him to ask his GF on stuff, but he refused cause he wanted the surprise factor.

She is probably salty you are closer to him than she is or something."
e3z6jm,"ESH

Unless you actually know that she is disruptive or doesn't pay attention you don't really have a right to judge her. Everyone learns in different ways and different teachers will inspire students differently. She can absolutely have the opinion that the teachers aren't very good if they are failing to engage her or take her needs as a student into account.

The appropriate response to make would have been ""oh you didn't like them? I've had them both and found them to be very good teachers""

She also sounds like she was being narrow-minded and judgemental. Texting you later and telling you that you need to rethink what you said seems petty."
e3zjd6,"NTA in fact, I'm surprised you didnt take everything out of your name.

If you havent done that with the utilities yet, I highly suggest you do that immediately.  If you don't live there then NOTHING in that place should be in your name now."
e3zl7a,"NAH, assuming your mom is looking out for your best interests and isn't just complaining about the hour. That said, I'd suggest carefully examining your outings and ensuring that they aren't affecting your grades, your health, etc, and that you aren't doing anything that'd get you in legal trouble."

If your parents want a big wedding, let them throw one for themselves."
e3zvxe,NTA. I do think you should have made it clear what you were taking so they had a chance to replace it but threatening you is way over the top.
e4029t,"NTA

But it depends on how you are 'correcting' their mistakes. If you're just pointing out every time they are wrong and being overly critical, that's kind of assholish, but if you're being helpful and showing them better ways to do it, and of course also making sure to explain to them why you are doing it, then you're not TA."
e404p5,"NTA. Your money, your decision. That said, I'd suggest a long talk with grandma and grandpa to make sure it's what they truly want, make sure it won't leave you destitute, and make sure they'll be cared for back in Vietnam."
e40bu1,ESH she should be more mindful and respectful of time.  You sound overbearing and patronizing.
e40iet,"Eh, close call, but I'll go with YTA. Your house, your rules, but it sounds like it wasn't your house. Thus, while it may have been more respectful to avoid the topic, it sounds like you threw a tantrum because the others disagreed with your positions."
e40r82,i don't think she's planning on getting the abortion dude
e40sw2,"YTA. It would have also been inconsiderate to ignore the phone. When you’re traveling with other people, sometimes you have to be inconvenienced. Making plans for the morning was important. If you didn’t want to do that, you should have made plans last night and let everyone know you were sleeping in"
e40xng,"NTA, just be sure you don't fall afoul of squatters rights where you live"
e416cd,"NTA. Your husband is purposefully doing his chores badly trying to get you so exhausted with him that you'll do them yourself. He also sounds very abusive with his words, which I am very sorry about. Is this a man you want to keep? Appreciation for what, exactly? Berating you?"
e41fyw,"NTA. The system was a gift of yours. You were kind enough to let your siblings use it. Your sister abused that by taking your game system to college without permission, and she has no right to get pissy about you putting your foot down and not allowing that to happen again."
e41j8k,YTA if you hide them and disrespect her wishes.  Talk to her and explain the situation and that you will be more careful than the previous tenant.
e41jv5,"YTA because you promised your friend a ride and aren’t coming through. I understand not wanting to upset your mom, but still, leaving your friend with no ride is shitty."
e41lb8,NTA. You are not required to be tolerant of intolerance. If your sister's orientation is that offensive to him that he can't put it aside for an evening with his family then he *should* stay away.
e41mcv,"Mate, you've been in seven car accidents and are still recovering from the last one... and your husband *still* doesn't realize that your anxiety isn't a commentary on his driving skills? NTA but maybe get couples therapy if you aren't already. This kind of thing would mess anyone up, and if the therapist can get your husband to realize that this is not and never has been about him, all the better."
e41n1u,"NAH. Tell him. Writing is hard, but you're right, you don't get anything if you don't try."
e41wqa,"NTA, any boss who expects someone to be happy 100% of the time while doing their job is unrealistic."
e422z3,"ESH... Unnecessary drama from all of you. You made a wrong assumption between you, you could have knocked gently on the door or something to see if she was up... Your sister was annoyed, and overreacted a bit for sure, thinking there was more to the situation than there is... But your rant at the end shows you to be anything but nonchalant when it comes to your sister, and is also a massive overreaction.

I assume there's a lot of history to this though, in wider terms I don't know who the asshole is, as there's definitely difficulties in your relationship with your sister... But in isolation, in the end it's just breakfast, and you and your sister are both making a massive deal out of it."
e42eqw,"NTA- I’ll never get why people say the opposite for these posts. I would want to know if it were me. If I were you, I would cut him out of my life for good though."
e42h6b,"YTA

That sounds frustrating. My husband is always whining when I lose stuff, but he loses things, too. I am sure you lose things every once in a while. So the language that is ""has"" to be her is wrong. It's *probably* her, or *most likely* her, but saying it is 100% her and you never misplace anything IS ABSURD. I am sure you make mistakes, too.

She should be more considerate of your things, but come on, it took you a minute to find your nail clippers? And you ""have to call her phone?"" Come on. That's your wife. Be nice."
e42jt9,NTA. I think family & business doesn’t work. I would just get up that share of the rent & move on from this situation because it’s not working out as it should.
e42t3x,"NTA your dad says he doesn't care, so you shouldn't. If he manages to fall asleep in each movie I can't believe that he's too invested. He likely just comes along to keep you company.

Don't listen to these strangers, both your parents were chill about you giving up the ticket for your friend."
e42vdk,"YTA.

Your brother told you that you pout when you don't get your way. Now you are on Reddit literally pouting. He went to your parents for support and you are mad they ""talked behind your back."" He is just trying to communicate his feelings in a delicate way. The original argument is pretty silly - he was trying to share something he loves (music) with you, and you got mad because it wasn't what you wanted. Half the music you want and half the music he wants sounds very reasonable.

ETA. You already have three specific examples. 1) the incident with your mom jabbing 2) the music 3) pouting on Reddit now."
e42ykn,"NTA

HIS family expects cards? Great, he can send them."
e435nq,Where is the interpersonal conflict?
e4383l,"NAH. She was trying to lighten the mood. She sounds like a caring woman, and you are obviously on edge. 

Let it go. Take some comfort from your wife. Life will go on. 

So sorry for your loss."
e438ni,"NTA, the ""blood is thicker than water"" excuse is bullshit. You shouldn't have to deal with a toxic person just because you're related. SIL sounds like a pathological liar. How does your wife feel about this though? Is she supportive of your decision to not associate with her sister?"
e43940,"NTA - maybe there is a self esteem thing there as you probably know but no, that doesn’t make you an asshole.  But...why the heck did your friend react like that and tell people who are now mad at you for it?  That’s an ahole move!"
e43cs8,"NTA: friends should be able to reality-check each other. I’d maybe ease it in a little though. Ask her to be realistic— when was her last modeling gig? Maybe even spin it such that having a higher paying job might actually afford her a couple of sessions with high profile photographers and give her room to invest/work her way out of Instagram-basic? 

She’s eventually gotta realize that pretty doesn’t last forever. But all you can do is lead her to it, and the kick in the ass has to come from her. If not, it’ll come from some other extreme outside force and it’s is going to suck even more."
e43dqt,"3 adults and none of you gets more food? 

ESH. But the little sister."
e43exa,"NTA - I wouldn't order the ""sad"" burger either."

e43i77,"YTA if you expect her to carry another kid when she’s like 50. But otherwise, no, I don’t think so. It’s normal to miss children and miss when they’re young. They’re so sweet, and innocent.

e44smw,"So... heres the fun news about in-kind donations.

Here's how it goes.

1. I donate a sofa to goodwill.
2. Goodwill gives me a receipt. It says: thanks for donating a sofa.
3. I forego the standard deduction on my taxes. I catalog my in-kind donation, using receipts. None of the receipts I have for in-kind donations will have a valuation on it (they used to but not any more). When I catalog my in-kinds for tax purpose, \*I\* am responsible for providing a valuation of the donation. (See #3 in the section about what a donation receipt is required to have:  [https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/create-a-501c3-tax-compliant-donation-receipt/](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/create-a-501c3-tax-compliant-donation-receipt/) ). 
4. Lets say I get audited as a result. I will have to have photos to prove the valuation I ascribed to my in-kind donations.

All that to say, its really not JUST a matter of getting a receipt. If your aunt wants the tax savings, she needs to do the work.

e44u42,"NTA You were clear and honest with her and she ignored you, that's something she needs to work on, not your fault. Honestly gifts should be something you give because you want to and can, not because you feel obligated or because you expect something in return. Also the fact that she keeps bragging about how much money she spent on your gift is really distasteful and of putting. It's pretty weird."
e44x86,"NTA. Also if I were to do it on FB, I’d post something on HIS profile not her photo. She just wants likes and comments..."
e44ycu,"NTA. you had absolutely no relationship
with this man and your step siblings even said you didnt have to be there. im sorry they didnt wish you a happy birthday, but i think you’re reading too much into that, they probably have bigger things on their mind."
e453ai,"Hugs help when the person hugging you respects your boundaries. If they don't respect them, then yell at you while showing you a bs article they certainly don't. They should add that disclaimer lol.
Jokes aside, NTA"
e454o1,"Yeah, no harm in setting up some boundaries to make a toxic relationship less toxic. Congrats on coming out.

NTA"
e455fi,NAH imo. It was a surprise gift I'm assuming and you didn't expect it. He was being nice and trying to help you but a phone is something you'll have for a few years before you get a new one so you should be happy with it. I think you should thank him for it but explain why it isn't practical for you
e45c3y,"If you don't want to hear people, you need to move. 
If the noise is bothering you, but even you admit it isn't excessive, then maybe YOU need to look at soundproofing solutions. 

Sometimes, it's not the other party that's the problem, and here it sounds like they are simply living there, which you can't fault them for."
e45csv,"NTA - it sounds like Joe wanted you there but only if it was convenient for him. You had planned on him picking you up, he bails because he doesn’t want to deal with traffic. I am assuming like any other mode of public transportation it would be money out of your pocket for something you weren’t all to invested in."
e45fam,"NTA as I bet they are aware it’s your space and that it’s residential parking.

However, it’s asking for trouble and I would’ve just let it go for tonight and I think your BF is being petty and causing trouble for the mistake he’s made, so he’s probably TA here too."
e45gsg,NTA. He knows you'll clean up after messes he makes *while he makes them*. Don't let him piss on your leg and tell you it's raining.
e45gu2,"NTA. It’s yours to send wherever you want, whenever you want, for any reason you want. Middle bro sounds entitled and like his priorities are outta whack."
e45h7r,NTA to meter your own emotional output. Sometimes things are just above your paygrade.
e45hlo,"NAH - I’m sure your boyfriend is upset that he let you down. But shit like anxiety doesn’t really care about other people’s feelings. Anxiety is one of those things where it can physically make you sick and I am sure that’s why he wanted you to take him back home. 

And while it sucks that he couldn’t make it, this is a thing that he needs to work on and get help for.

Talk to him. Maybe even make dinner together at his house. Have a nice relaxing evening."
e45i8x,No one is ever an asshole “in a good way”.  Your SO sounds toxic and you should slowly remove yourself from him.
e45j6m,"NTA

As far as I can tell (not knowing typical US semester dates) you gave them about 9 months notice of your intention to move? That is plenty of time for them to make alternative arrangements. And by the sounds of it your continued living situation was just assumed on their part, rather than based on actual discussions, so it isn't even like you went back on your word. *And* you've said you'll help find them a new person. You're fine mate."
e45m1g,She probably wakes you up doing all the stuff moms do to make children like you comfortable. YTA and a brat for even thinking this makes good sense.
e45n12,"YTA if you go see your grandparents at all. They sound awful and like they are emotionally abusing your aunt with cancer. Even if it's a religious thing, they're still giant assholes and so are people who hand wave or excuse that behavior."
e45orh,NTA. It was your food. She should’ve asked.
e45qax,I think YTA for not taking your husbands feelings into consideration. You both created this child and so he should have a say in what the name should be and you guys could come to a compromise.
e45r92,NTA — not your responsibility. You offered him help and it wasn’t what he wanted. He has no right to be pissy with you. You didn’t have to answer his phone call at all on Thanksgiving. You could’ve had it off the whole day to spend with family.
e45rq4,"YTA, she can't make everyone a bridesmaid. Be thankful you don't have to spend time or money on it."
e45ug9,Info - if you knew going into it they'd be gone through the end of December why won't you leave now?
e45w39,"NTA. Fuck that guy. Save those kids.

Do be careful though, this woman might harbor ill will towards your mother, and she might act on it, and you will be the one who gave her the information."
e45x75,"NTA. You have every right to choose your own makeup, and it was bizarre and controlling of your mom to try to take that control away from you in such a public confrontation. Is your mom this overbearing in other ways too?"
e45xpz,"YTA.

>He told me that it wasn’t really my place to say, and that he was bisexual and not gay. I kinda shrugged and told him that they were basically the same and he got upset and told me that he was going to bed.

This is the thing. It's not your place to say. You're making decisions for him and that makes you TA."
e45z1k,""" I didn’t go because I wasn’t personally asked to come ""

I was going to say N-A-H, but after this ""clarification"" from you, YTA.  You knew you were invited, but because someone didn't beg you to come, you decided to make a statement and not come. Who knows, maybe more ""friends"" will just decide to do the same thing as they see you being an ass about it. 

It would be different if you HONESTLY did not think you were invited.

I am guessing there were other friends that showed up to the party without a formal invitation either."
e462ep,"NTA, at all. Your current husband needs to work on himself, because that’s a pretty gross thing to make you feel guilty about. It’s not like you’re harbouring feelings for an ex; he died. You’re allowed to miss him and grieve him and want to remember him. 

That said, approach current hubs with love. Try to understand his feelings and let him know you care about him, but you don’t feel comfortable hiding your late husband or his life. Conflict resolution should be about finding a true solution, not winning a fight. Good luck!"
e464nr,NTA- tell them now before this becomes a habit.
e469ns,"For the record, NTA and I think everyone calling you petty is being absurd. Your ex puts in no effort during the year but wants you to just hand over your son on Christmas? Parenting is all the shit that happens between New Year's and Xmas....

That being said, your son is old enough to make the decision and if you discuss it with him without making him feel guilty or like he's the bad guy, I think no matter his decision it would be a win for you."
e46fdg,NAH - You stopped when you realized you were being creepy
e46kz5,The freemasons....run girl....run.
e46m4y,"NTA - But it seems like maybe it could've been handled better. It's okay to want some things to be just for you, and it's also okay to want your boyfriend to respect that.

The 5 year old is just the same, but they're still learning so it's something that has to be taught, just like all manners"
e46q88,"When I opened this, I thought it was going to be a picture of *you* and him, and I was like, yeah, he should probably change that, it's telling people you're still together. But your dog? I mean. I don't know if it makes you an asshole or not, but it does seem pretty childish.

I'd say yeah, YTA. You weren't just to ask, that's fine, but he said no, with good reason, and to keep pushing himself about it, yeah. Just move on."
e46x7k,Tell them together?
e477i2,What about an ultimatum? You will remove her from the class u less mom agrees to stay in another room.
e47ig3,Is this a real post?  Over 55 cents? YTA for this post.
e47ilw,"NTA though in the future, it would probably be more fair to remind the kids who aren’t doing the work they agreed to do that they aren’t meeting expectations and if they don’t pick it up, they won’t be getting paid."
e47mll,Yta. Why does it matter and why did you feel the need to point it out not having ever met the kid?
e47n3o,"NTA for merely asking, but YWBTA for demanding it. You have no jurisdiction over who your mutual friends associate."
e47xe9,"NTA, they're keeping the deposit, your paths have diverged, it is what it is"
e47xr5,"NTA

You barely get any PTO in the whole year and their expectations are not reasonable."
e4803u,"ESH. Shoplifters obviously suck, but you did behave unprofessionally and deserved to be reprimanded at the very least."
e4817e,NTA. I’m sorry this happened to you. You deserve friends who will be honest with you and he refuses to do that.
e482ug,"YTA

You were sneaking around their home while everyone else was together and expecting you to be there. This is a huge violation of social norms and you are the asshole for that.

If you don't agree with the social norms, don't participate. I'm with you on gift opening. But please - don't act like opening gifts is so morally repugnant that you physically cannot be in the same room and needed to go somewhere else. In someone else's home. Without asking them. It's just not respectful and it's really weird behaviour."
e4840y,"NTA. Your friend is taking advantage at this point. Your mom wants him out, it’s your job to tell him that."

e485wq,"NTA. This roommate is a gigantic asshole. If you’re paying rent, you get access to common spaces whenever you want - not when the guy sleeping on the couch allows it."
e488on,NTA - - Your friend is the asshole for telling her about your conversation with him. He should have done this on his own without you telling him. I hope your sister eventually realizes you did this because you love her.
e489s6,"I see no harm in bringing them, but I would ask the friend first if they mind if you knitted during the hangout.  NAH, necessarily."
e489yn,"NTA.  Sounds like your mom is toxic and you avoiding her is best for you.  All OK NTA for exploding, people can only take so much constant criticism."
e48aem,NTA. Every kid needs an adult in their life that they can go to with things like this. It’s awesome that your nephew has you to fill that role.
e48ez2,"NTA - but don't hold it against the cousin.

Talk to your parents about requesting your aunt repay for the damaged brushes and wasted paint."
e48gev,"NTA, but the best course is to leave her alone. I understand the hurt that can come from thinking someone was a good friend, only to find out that they didn't care about you as much as you do them. Also, establishing boundaries (which it sounds like you were doing by being more assertive) tends to weed out people who don't respect your boundaries. It hurts like hell, but overall you're better in the long run to not have people like this in your life.

Edit: I misread and thought it was HER wedding at first. It's understandable that you might not be invited to her sister's wedding, even if she wanted to invite you. With the per person costs, wedding lists can get cut throat, so I wouldn't hold it against your friend that you weren't invited. The fact that she said ""leave me alone "" still makes me think that you should, in fact, leave her alone. But if you are missing her and your friendship still after a few weeks or months, I think it would be acceptable to check back in with her."
e48lj9,"NTA you’re not stopping him from chasing his goals, you’re just not willing to give up your own, which is totally fair! A steady job, a car, and a degree are all very important and realistic things to want for yourself. Don’t let him bully you into leaving"
e48max,"NTA Everyone expressed interest in the meat-related pizzas and ""agreed"" to the cheese ones. Then they ate the only pizza you could eat and did not apologize for not leaving you a slice. If they want cheese pizza, they should order cheese pizza."
e48mq8,"NTA. You have an obligation to tell your friend things like this - you have no obligation to this acquaintance. If you don’t want people finding out you’ve done shady shit, don’t do shady shit."
e48nf3,NAH. Part of being a parent is teaching kids the tough lessons they need to know in order to relate to others and be kind. You did the right thing.
e48nhz,NTA. That’s gross. I hope he was at least sleeping on a sheet on the couch.
e48oe3,"YWBTA. If she's as bad as you describe, she will take any humiliation you put on her, multiply it by 100, and inflict it on your brother as revenge. 

PS, this is a good example of why ""I don't sugarcoat things, I tell it like it is"" people are like 2-year-olds in their ethical and emotional intelligence. Good for you for asking for advice though."
e48p9m,"oooooh lady I was on your side until you started using sex as leverage. Use your words and work through the issue; don’t punish people for not giving in to what you want. 

ESH."
e48qr8,NTA. There’s no point in her spending a ton of money on furniture that you don’t like and will most likely end up putting on Craigslist or donating
e48vq1,"Rule8. A Gala, really a Gala that he ""had to go"", really ? And a hat for graduation how old is he, maybe your shitpost should say prom."
e490vl,"NAH - this is pretty par for the course given the boundaries you agreed to. If you don’t like it, you need to say something"
e491wd,NTA. Don’t light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. Never let anyone make you feel guilty for prioritizing your own well being and eliminating the toxic from your life.
e493nx,NTA.  Your wife is an enabler and her brother desperately needs to learn how to be an adult with adult responsibilities.  Sometimes that means being forced to figure things out the hard way.
e494tc,YTA. It’s not yours until you pay for it. As a cashier I’ve seen things go wrong with credit cards and cash registers. What happens if something gets screwed up and you can’t pay for it? You’ve just stolen that item. And you’re teaching your kids to do the same. As a mom I always had snacks in my bag.  Let your kids eat/drink things you’ve already bought.
e49aiw,[removed]
e49b4y,NTA. No need to attend and be uncomfortable in the presence of people who don't even like you or want you there. You can always visit your bio mom at her grave if you want.
e49c0g,Ehh NAH.  She was doing it by accident obviously.  She can’t control what she does while asleep.  But at the same time I don’t blame you for doing what you can to mitigate her uncontrollable response.
e49wxi,"**You are NTA.** It should have been the guy's responsibility to ask you questions about the behavior of the cats before adopting them from you. It is also not your responsibility to take the cats from these owners as you have signed off your ownership of them. These man and woman are also both wrong for suggesting to put down healthy cats. I don't know what country you are in but in the U.S., animal abuse is against the law and punishable for jail time and heavy fines."
e49ybl,"YTA. Your uncle gave you a job and hired your friends I assume based off of your recommendation. When you left for another job and took them with, you were leaving him SOL. He tried to be civil to you, for the sake of your relationship. Quitting left him in even worse shape because he was hugely understaffed and had no one to train the two new hires. He’s your family and he did right by you by hiring you all in the first place, the least you could have done was leave at your notice date."
e49yif,NTA. That flatmate is a total dick though. Also...u might want to keep an eye on him around ur gf. That whole scene was dodgy asf.
e4a3al,ABSOLUTELY NTA - And here’s why. I hear it a lot especially on my small inbred city. I’m constantly asked to move for families though my SO and are childless and intend to stay that way. The way I see it is that their poor planning is not my issue. Period. But families constantly run late and expect others to accommodate them. Nah. Not happening.
e4aa3y,"NTA. I feel you should wear what makes you comfortable, irrespective of the event."
e4abf5,"ESH and NAH

You got rid of something he cared about because it was creepy to you 

He kept a dead fucking lizard corpse for four years."

e4aucc,"I mean you sure sound like YTA. She’s seven. Take a bite, say something dumb like “yum, i’m full right now but this is amazing!” and send her on her way. Not hard."
e4axj0,"Your absence isn’t causing them pain, it is causing them GUILT, which is completely deserved it sounds like. And it isn’t your job to fix their guilt."
e4b91f,"NAH and I think it's a lovely idea. It's called a ""plus one"" because it's you plus one person of your choosing. I think especially since your friends know and like your mom it's completely fine. If you're worried whether it might be a problem for your friends (I doubt it or they'd have let you know in the invitation) you can just ask them, but really I think it should be fine. It's not like she's a random acquaintance or something. It really should be all good. I hope you and your mom have fun!"
e4bf5a,"NTA: This just makes me sad, and I would consider dropping these “friends” over this. 

Have they done anything like this to you before? Did anything happen during the planning process that would have inclined them to blow you off?"
e4bhlg,"You are N T A for buying a more expensive gift for your bf than his family members. BUT

e4bo1z,"I'm going to say YTA. Not because you are having a baby and have chosen to be stay at home parent, but because you don't seem to understand how not using your degree could upset your parents. I'm sure they made some major sacrifices to provide for your tuition, room & board, and spending money.  Maybe you will use your degree for employment later, but the longer you go without using it the less it will help you land a job. Hopefully your marriage works out and you won't need to support yourself financially. If it doesn't you will understand why many people postpone starting a family to get their careers started."
e4boa2,"NAH, but you may want to consider seeing a therapist."
e4brdy,Info: Are these ideas and projects expected from your typical work? Currently sounds like you want acknowledgement for just doing your job.
e4brnp,education is more important than a dead-end job
e4bwkp,"NTA. Your sister needs to knock it off. She has no business critiquing your home or cleaning it. Tell her that if she doesn’t stop, she’ll no longer be allowed in your home."
e4bzxv,"Damn, reading this post makes me feel soooo old.

ESH. Don't unfriend her, because I bet you'll make up in a couple months and you'll end up adding her again."
e4c21d,"NAH. This isn’t being dishonest. If you don’t need to turn your heat on, you’d be silly to do so."
e4c83s,"NAH. It sounds like just a really unfortunate miscommunication? Would you feel comfortable with not backtracking exactly, but rather just making it a positive thing? Like “now you know i want to marry you! But you can still totally propose to me!” 
Either way, he’s not wrong for wanting to propose to you and you weren’t wrong for proposing to him."
e4cay0,"NTA

It is your hair. 

But I do hope you're dying it for more reasons than ""Everyone at school had been asking me to"""
e4ccu7,"Controversial YTA 

You are a college student, which sounds like you don't live at home any more. It isn't your cat. The rest of your family got a cat and will continue to care for it. You are bonding with it while it is still a kitten and imprinting that it prefers your room while your siblings who will be around more are by default limited in interacting with it. You can't both ""set up spots for it"" and just pretend it just prefers your room. 

And you know what? It could be your siblings want to spend time with you and the kitten is a pretense. It's definitely a break, so you are entitled to spend it any where you like. Rent a b&b away from your family and do you work by yourself. Or you could have stayed on campus. You are grown up. But you decided no, I'll go home for thanksgiving. Your family has a reasonable expectation that you will spend time with them, especially the younger ones. But it's definitely assholic to be snippity with your EIGHT YEAR OLD SISTER who wants to play with a kitten and talk her older college age sister's ear off while you stay at her home! My two pence."
e4cd4y,Info: why can't you go by yourself or with friends without him?
e4cf39,NTA. It’s bad enough that he used your belongings without asking but he also went into your private space to retrieve the item and then lied about it.
e4ch76,NTA. You're dealing with immense pressure and you're young. Your feelings about your mother are valid and you're allowed to speak them.
e4cj00,YTA You're lacking the very basics of social media etiquette. You ask before you post other people's images. People don't have to ask you not to post them.
e4cnn3,ESH- ya'll are fucked up. Probably not a good idea to get married.
e4cs6z,"NTA it's your choice to have people in your life and if you don't want them in it then you don't have to. I have a very very messed up family and only talk to 1 aunt and a couple of my cousins and siblings. I am no contact with the rest of them and it makes my life so much better.

e4d1h3,Nta. You didn't feel comfortable and they made homophobic jokes IN FRONT OF SOMEONE WHO IS GAY.
e4d4bs,"YTA. Did you not realize that the messages refresh everywhere when new ones come in or go out? Also, it sounds as if you’re trying to make it sound like she purposefully snooped through your messages and just happened to see it. What probably happened is she saw the message from your coworker come in (because, ya know, you didn’t close the window) and then automatically saw your reply. That doesn’t quite qualify as snooping through your messages."
e4d6q0,"NTA. If your mom wants an invite, she needs to discuss that with your dad. It isn’t fair to ask you to get in the middle."
e4dbj2,"NTA. It doesn't make sense to assign the smaller bedroom to two children and the bigger bedroom to one child. Your parents are being unreasonable, but their house their rules I guess."

e4dvcs,"NTA.  I feel like people are using anxiety as a way to cover for themselves to do really rude things.  I’m not  suggesting anxiety isn’t real, not at all.   I have anxiety and that shit is a shitty mcturd. 

But using my anxiety as an excuse for bad behavior is wrong.  She should have communicated her state of mind/feelings during the trip.  

*but she can’t cause she has anxiety*

No.  It’s not an excuse.  For anyone dealing with anxiety I’m gonna be mad clear.  If we keep our experience to ourselves and then blame the world around us for not helping/“catering” to us we are wrong.  How the fuck anyone will know we’re going through something?

*but I don’t like confrontation*

Telling someone something isn’t negative.  Confronting something only means facing it.  If you *don’t* face it the problem usually evolves into something worse.  

So this friend was wrong.  All she had to do was pull you to the side and say the week was overwhelming.  You and your fam could have adjusted things for her.   If she still wanted to go home you’d have a heads up.  

Guys I’m all about self care, boundaries, putting myself first and respecting my mental health but I won’t use my mental health as an excuse for rudeness.   NTA."

e4ehc8,"NAH

You aren’t an asshole, you’re just a teenage girl. And being a teenage girl can be rough. I know it doesn’t feel this way, but fifteen is so young. Your looks are going to change over the next few years, as are the tastes of the boys around you. 

Focus on the things that make you feel good about yourself — both your looks and your other gifts. Are you really good at one subject or activity? Are you really funny or a great friend? Everyone has things they are good at. Lean into those things.

Instead of telling your parents you want plastic surgery, maybe talk to your mom about less drastic things you can do to help you feel better about how you look (different haircut? family walks after dinner? more of your favorite shirt?).

The better you feel about yourself the more relaxed and attractive you will be.

Also, wear sunscreen."
e4emk0,"NAH. You are rightly feeling protective of your wife and it upsets you to see her run ragged by her GM and M. Her GM sounds like she is dementing. She is in her 80s and she is not going to be around for long. She is acting out of love. Please try not to show your resentment towards GM and M. Because if you do, your wife will feel even worse because she will be upset that you are upset. It will be another burden in her heart. Support her as best as you can. Are there any community support for elderly people where you live?"
e4et4a,"NTA. Go dance if you want to.

You're not going to ever be his long-term/life partner. The fact that he's keeping you secret from his family even after three years makes that clear. You're just his ""placeholder"" until he marries someone his family finds acceptable. I'm sorry, but that's the truth of the matter.

In addition to that he's making _you_ feel like what you enjoy doing is wrong and dirty, and that female sexuality isn't acceptable to express.

This relationship of yours will end at some point, so I'd get out before he makes you even more miserable."
e4ezyx,"NAH. You aren't required to buy them, but she's allowed to do what she wants. I hate smoking too but my grandma just wants to die and honestly I feel sad that she's still here. If she wanted to smoke, i wouldn't buy em for her, but I don't think I'd stop her."
e4f5k5,"YTA. If your partner is the one who will be looking after the child on weekends, then she ABSOLUTELY should have been involved in the discussion. She's not supposed to be the one taking care of the child all the time. You are. He's your son. It sounds like you and your ex need to get a formal custody arrangement set up and you need to start taking your partner's opinions into consideration before going along with whatever your ex wants, otherwise I doubt you'll be having a partner for too much longer."
e4f9vh,"Completely unrelated but what a shite gift (IMO) 

At least a bottle of wine or something has a purpose..."
e4flqh,"NTA - you owe your family nothing. Put yourself and your husband first, it sounds like you have a lot of healing to do and they’re not going to be remotely helpful with that. I wish you both all the best!"
e4fpv8,"NTA - but I've never understood why people care so much about their things when living in a group setting, Especially with family. I feel like it's easier to just share now and know that (hopefully) you'll eventually be in a financially stable place where you don't have to share with anyone you don't want too. I get the urge to punch your sibblings over using your stuff but in the long run its just stuff and this is just temporary."
e4frcz,NTA you'll continue to make and lose friends for your entire life. Learn a lesson and move on to friends who don't make you uncomfortable.
e4ft0l,NTA - “My wife and kids are my family. They are most important to me.” - that should be enough of a reason.
e4fvj4,"YTA - number 1,  for butting into a conversation that doesn’t involve you. Number 2, for belittling other people’s lives. I’m sorry but I find it hard to believe that you were so evolved as a teenager to not care about ANY “petty meaningless” things.  You can be thinking about college and going to a party. 

And number 3, for pretending at age 25 that you’re some wisen old sage who’s giving such pearls of wisdom to young whippersnappers, how dare they not take your advice. Dude, wake up. You’re still basically a kid yourself, successful business or not. And you clearly have a lot to learn about compassion and people."
e4fvjn,"I know I'm in the minority here, but nta. 

My wife grew up with a mom who would have no food but there would be beer in the fridge. There would be days without electricity or phone, but she'd have her cigarettes.

e4fxoe,"NTA - unless your boss is heavily invested in you and your career, they are always going to do what's best for themselves and the company.

e4glaw,"YTA. While being able to be honest with our friends is important, there was no need to put down her interest in that way. You don’t know if she would actually be a good nurse. The fact that she isn’t a traditionally social person doesn’t mean she couldn’t be a good caretaker. She seemed to enjoy, and do well with assisting her elderly neighbour, so why wouldn’t she do well in other similar situations."
e4gld8,"YWBTA. Your partner doesn’t want you to do this, and since it’s their name I feel like what they want matters more than you getting satisfaction from petty revenge."
e4glrw,NTA holy crap is this guy still hugely popular now?
e4gqcd,"Haha, NTA. They're manipulating you into trying out their product; classic scam/mlm technique."
e4gs80,"YTA. I think if you viewed women as people to be friends with first instead of just potential dating candidates that this situation could have been avoided.  I guess it’s one thing if you’re just looking to hook up, but that’s not really what friends’ parties are for..

If you aren’t trying to “waste time” talking to women with boyfriends, I’d say skip the party altogether because the girls there probably don’t want to talk to you anyway."
e4gty4,"NAH it's your birthday and you should do what you want to do, even if that's nothing. 
Maybe if you explained all of this to the people who are buying the gift, they would understand, you seem like a loving family. 

Maybe you should suggest a different idea like ""I really love that you are trying to make my birthday special, what would really make it amazing, is if instead of Vegas we used the money to have a family trip to (insert a place you would like to go)"". 

That way, your family still get to spoil you like they want, but it's also more what you would want to do rather than Vegas."

e4h5fx,"NAH. His mother put you in a tough spot, no doubt interpreting you as a better friend than you were (after all, you came over in a restaurant and hugged him!).

She put her pride before the animals wellbeing."
e4huc7,"YTA just because you're ""above it"", doesn't mean that ""fat"" isn't a negative descriptor to the rest of the world. I love my body, as a ""Fat Girl"" and I hate it when people think I'm being self-loathing when I describe my body as fat. But I also wouldn't want my friend describing me as ""the fat one"" because I'm more than my body and it *does* imply that I'm the odd one out because I'm fat."
e4i0am,YTA for not taking the time to write a letter. And showing others jumping a turnstile is acceptable.
e4i12l,"NAH. 

There are scientific links between overuse of technology and things like disrupted sleep patterns, stress, depression, etc. (This trend is especially spiking with children and teens.) Your mom isn't wrong to make the changes she did if technology use is an issue. I can't tell you whether or not you or your siblings are ""overusing."" If there are good changes happening, then she should stick with what's working. 

However, it's not necessarily fair for her to punish the ""household"" on the actions of your siblings. You make your post seem like the consequences are more based off of their actions than yours. If this is how you feel, maybe talk to her. 1-2 hours of gaming here and there isn't the end of the world as long as you are doing ok otherwise. But maybe she is seeing something you're not."
e4i3u4,"NTA. Even if it’s true it may have been assholish to bring up unprompted, but at that point she had it coming when she tried to attack your parenting as an absent parent."

e4iajj,NTA. I think this is good parenting. Your step-daughter needs to understand how her actions are affecting others. I think this is a gentle way to help her learn this lesson and will hopefully make her more mindful of others around her.
e4ifkx,"NTA.  For people who aren't into kids, a party full of them is a nightmare.  Parents often get upset because their friendships die after they have kids, but they have to understand that their friends don't want to get together in situations that revolve around children."
e4ihzc,"YTA because of this. Don't embarrass your sister like this. If you know she's in there stay out it's not difficult. Should she lock the door, eh, she should respond to knocks, yes.

e4jhol,"NTA but it does sound like your wife views you cleaning the shed as you getting away from the family, and maybe views her cleaning the bathroom as being in service to the family, and perhaps that’s the disconnect.

And you have to be careful not to over-accuse - jumping to pointing out hypocrisy (her having a character flaw, and you being the judge) rather than trying to understand why she views it differently is perhaps not the best move on your part.

Hope you can talk it out with her."
e4jkta,"YTA because it's depression, not ""depression."" No one needs friends who doubt everything they say."

e4klee,"YTA

At this point I would be more concerned with why she has changed so much and then wonder if you still want to support her. 

Maybe she is just busy or overwhelmed.

Or maybe she is just only sees you as reliable ATMs.

e4l6qq,"NTA Howdy from Texas.  I want to address this a couple of ways if you please.  1) I think you and I both know 14 horses and a 9 stall barn on only 3 acres isn’t right (is it even legal there???) Typically you need at the very bare minimum an acre a horse and that’s just bare grazing.  A stall per horse is also standard care. It sounds like she’s gotten in over her head.  2) I agree whole heartedly with you backing off helping them because what seemed to be a favor in the beginning, appears to now be a burden she’s trying to guilt trip you in.  Stand your ground.  On a side note, the horses really need to be looked at properly and if she’s starting to age in years to where she physically can’t look after them, perhaps it’s time to help her look into other options such as selling the farm.  In the end, the ones suffering the worst will be the animals."
e4lbva,"Let me guess, you’re all teenagers? He should hug who he wants. He’s not kissing her, not grabbing her ass. Don’t be jealous- it’s unattractive. YTA"
e4lpln,"YTA. You told her to stop buying you bracelets, so she’s giving you cash instead. That shows a respect for your boundaries and receptivity to feedback. Maybe it’s not because she’s trying to buy you; maybe she’s just showing you that she still considers you part of the family and she hasn’t forgotten about you and doesn’t want to give up on you. Assuming your grandma’s worst offense is just being excessively religious, you’re being mean. 

You don’t have to go to Christmas. But you should make more of an effort to be kind to your grandma, who clearly misses you.

Consider having a heart to heart about why you’ve distanced yourself. And consider whether there is a third avenue where you can have a cordial and respectful relationship where religion doesn’t come up. 

(fwiw: my parents are also overbearingly religious, and I just grey rocked the shit out of them whenever they brought it up, and now they just don’t bring it up around me anymore.)"
e4lpsw,"1.  NTA.  If he wanted you there, then he would have invited you himself,

e4m5um,"NAH. You both have pretty reasonable stances and I think its up to you both to figure out how to handle this. It's hard having a pet that could remind you of one that has passed, but it also sucks to give up on owning a breed you've owned most of your life because itll make your partner sad.

My parents let me fail a really big project like that in 4th or 5th grade because I just didn’t want to put the effort into it and it taught me (a wildly overachieving Type-A student) that everything requires effort if I want a good grade, and a lot of that requires planning.

Do you have a friend you can stay with?"
e4mtib,"NTA but do you have a lease?  While it sounds like he’s an asshole it’s hard to tell without knowing his side.  If you guys have constant disagreements (regardless of who is right) and you have no lease, then I am not surprised that he used that power card."
e4my1m,"NTA. It's hard to do work for an organization you're not passionate about. Your mental and physical health need to be your priority right now, and your mum will figure it out. It may mean that she needs to scale back the size of her rescue, or find some sort of outside funding to help her staff it, but that's not your responsibility. 

You spent years doing something you actively hated for your mother, it isn't fair to you that she put that on you (whether she meant to or not) and you are totally justified in putting yourself first and taking steps to make yourself happier and healthier. 

Best of luck to you with everything!"

e4nfyg,Nah but you guys need communicate better and work on your finances together so you both know what is going on. There is no excuse for you not to know whether your loans are being pair or not. You're a fool if you our your financial future in anyone elses sole control.
e4nhq5,"YTA
Don’t take this as me saying that you’re a bad person, you’re not. This is a difficult situation to traverse and it’s ok to be confused. However, you know information that could save this man from possibly years of turmoil due to this. If he finds out now before kids, marriage, and you know, life he can, in time, be ok. He can break of the relationship and move on. If you say nothing, there’s a high chance she cheats again and there could be more than just a house on the line, ie kids. I would say be upfront but expect some form of backlash. Good luck OP"
e4nmoe,NTA- are you really contemplating risking an advancement in your career so your bf can continue to be lazy? Please take the job. Who knows if you will get another opportunity. They fact that he is asking you to turn this down is also concerning as well. Something to think about with your partner. They should be encouraging and bring you up. Frankly he sounds selfish.
e4nn5v,NTA and please ignore the people telling you that's you're overreacting or seem crazy. If this post was about someone destroying someone's video games or other nerd crap there would be no question. Destroying your personal belongings is NEVER excusable under ANY circumstances.

e4ny15,Of course but you did it in a manipulative way. You could have easily said yes I’m excited to pick you up because I’ve had a rough day and I need a hug. Instead you expected her to know you needed support by asking a weird question and she seemed immediately annoyed by it.
e4ny3n,NTA she's upset with you because you wouldn't let her cheat.
e4nyzy,NTA. your dad is being emotionally abusive by threatening you with suicide/giving up custody.
e4nz7u,NTA he doesn’t get to decide who hooks up with whom and if it’s because he has feelings for her then he needs to communicate that more than just demanding you don’t get together.

This is the most heart wrenching thing I've ever read. Your dad is a complete fucking asshole. I don't care HOW grief stricken he was, it wasn't your fault and he shouldn't have made you suffer for it. He should have let you enjoy your birthday, what is WRONG with him?!

I'm so sorry about your mom, I'm so sorry your birthday celebrations were stolen from you. I'm so, so sorry. Please have a good birthday and enjoy your cake. Happy birthday, friend."
e4o1wo,"NAH, if she’s considering getting a one that’s secondhand it only makes sense To give her yours. But DO NOT give it to her on her birthday or as a gift. Just give it to her and explain she can have it if she’d like it because you are looking to change brands. It has nothing to do with her birthday. For her birthday give her actual gifts. Don’t even bring up the watch or money at all."
e4o407,"NAH It’s hard to tell sometimes when someone considers you their best friend, especially at a younger age. It sucks you didn’t feel it was mutual but it’s a learning curve in friendships overall as you grow older. Does it suck you didn’t see it that way? Sure but you didn’t have bad intentions."
e4o4k5,"YTA

You found things that were not yours and acted as if they were. How do you even possibly think you are not the asshole here? Obviously you are. Its not your business where he keeps his stuff or if he uses it. It's HIS.

**Edit** to add that the rest of the details about your roommate are irrelevant. You added those to make yourself look better, and tbh this is one of the most biased posts I have seen here. You didn't even try to be impartial."
e4o648,NTA but i would tread lightly. And be prepared to lose a friend.
e4o65t,"NTA. You said that you’d waited for them to cross and that they didn’t. And then when you started turning they moved. Maybe they didn’t see the light change, who knows. 

I think your neighbor was just being judgy. You said the father and son didn’t notice so the neighbor is making a big deal out of nothing, I’d say."
e4o8ar,"NTA. Yeah, it's probably a hurtful thing to say, but you came from a place of honesty, not so much as wanting to offend your mother.

Alcoholism and depression left unchecked can cause a lot of harm to others, whether or not the harm is intended. Unless your mother can genuinely recognize the changes she needs to make and actively work towards achieving the changes, it's understandable why you feel the way you do and wouldn't want her behavior/actions influencing any future children you could have."
e4oc0j,YTA if you limit the policy to just your mom and grandma. Why not extend it to the whole family and do a baked goods exchange instead? That way you wouldn’t be alienating just your mom and grandma.
e4og5s,NTA. Always remember that your boss wouldn't risk their life for you.
e4ogcl,"YTA- Good job burying the content. You cheated on your wife, she was upset enough that her last words were grievances with you, and she died horribly and drawn out. That traumatizes a kid! Meanwhile you have a ""family assistant"" who seems more of a parent than you considering who she turns to for help even if it is just money.  

You think maybe your daughter is acting out because you have been terrible to her mother and clearly not involved enough in her life to have an idea of what is going on? Your description of her friends sounds like you disapprove of everything. Were it drugs and age alone, you may have a point, but throwing ethnicity in there is an eyebrow raiser.  

Moving will just lead her to fall in with the first crowd she finds that she knows you will hate because it sounds like she hates you and it sounds like you have given her reasons. If you want to fix this, you have a lot of work ahead of you and it won't start until you can admit how much you have failed her already. If you want to stick to fighting the symptoms rather than the root cause, don't worry about moving. She will take care of that for you soon enough."
e4ogpc,You're NTA for wanting your parents to treat you like their child and not a roommate whose personal space they can't even respect.

e4oxa6,Dude nta its a cult
e4p1uw,NTA - Getting offended at cards against humanity means you probably shouldn’t play it.
e4p22r,NTA. Your mom sucks.
e4p8rv,NTA but from what you've said about this guy it does sound a bit like he's deliberately sitting in the room to be there while you do it and he comes across as a bit creepy. There's no need to change your routine as you live there and it seems your roommate has some relationship issues to work out.

e4pc98,"YTA your sense of humour kind of tells it all. It's funny among friends but at the expense of other. That's a typical asshole trait. Does that make you racist? No, however, the continuation of racism thrives through people like yourself that allows these things to be said in humour. I use to be the same way so I get where you coming from, but a friend broke it down of the harm it does even in jest."
e4pew3,"YTA - Not because you’re not right, but because you went about it in a way that will almost certainly cause your daughter to rebel against you. You should have been upfront with her. She would have been pissed, but ultimately, know you were acting with her best interests in mind."

e4qa84,"NTA but isn't 31 weeks pretty visibly pregnant? I totally hear you that your pregnancy is more about you and I'm sorry that they're making it about them but if you're worried about it being a secret, I feel like anyone who sees you will probably know anyway? some might not be worth the angst of trying to keep it a secret?

Break up with her. That behavior is unquestionably fucked."
e4qagw,"This might be unpopular but, YTA

It seems like you escalated everything to a point that was unnecessary.

Was he threatening your aunt's safety at the family meeting?

I would say that there are ways to deal with this before escalating it to police involvement. Talking to your aunt, for one. Encouraging her to leave her husband if you think that's apt. Hell maybe even talking to her husband if you feel so strongly about what he's said to her.

You would not be in the wrong for standing up for your aunt. Calling the police based on the facts you've provided, however, seems excessive.

EDIT: Info- on what basis did the police charge him with verbal abuse? Did they witness anything?"
e4qftz,NTA — it’s only natural for children to move out and make their own homes. The fact that she’s manipulative and takes advantage of you only means you need to do it more.
e4qg1a,NAH.  I understand their point about your s/o being 3 years older and possibly taking advantage of you.  Though I do think it's odd they're still not allowing you to go over as an adult.  You also didn't talk about your parents interactions with your s/o and his parents.  Could they not have trusted his parents but trust your sisters bfs parents?  I just think theres a lot of factors that can make the two situations very different and both you and them have good points.  You need to talk to them about letting you be an adult.
e4qjmc,I'm going to abstain from an official verdict here and just say please tell your mom about your anxiety and what boundaries you need so that you're able to show her love in a way that feels good for both of you.

e4qnw4,"NTA. I would decline the religious aspect of it, and you can do so without being the asshole. However, if she is looking at godparent status as ""if we die, will you be guardian for my child"" then there are ways to accomplish that without having to participate in a religious ceremony."

It's not fair to say a friend ""suddenly become part of the mothers group."" People have children, and it's normal and nice, and it's something you aspire to. Don't write them off just because they have something you want.

I don't really think you're an A, I think you're going through something very difficult and you need to see a therapist to work through all this. But I do think you're in the wrong for isolating yourself from anyone who inadvertently says or does the wrong thing.

And if someone told me they were struggling to have children, I would never ask ""which one of you is the problem."" If anyone does ask you that, tell them you're not comfortable discussing it."
e4s30v,"YWBTA. First of all, if your ex is using the money to pay her rent, that is providing your kids with a place to live and is a completely appropriate way of spending the money.

e4sdbi,"ESH - Coming from a dad of 3 and one is a step- daughter, never put the kid in the middle. Wake up and get you SO out of bed if needed, but don’t let that little girl be embarrassed or stressed because she’s late. It isn’t her fault. Plus, kids thrive on routine. Her entire day would be thrown off by getting there late. It doesn’t matter if me and my wife are fighting, all my kiddos know I’d move heaven and earth for them.

e4sjr5,"NTA it's a difficult situation to be in, when you're never good enough. Try to ignore your mom when you do your best and she's still not happy. As long as you're doing the best you can that's reason enough to be satisfied with your self."

You're allowed to have boundaries. In this case, this boundary is vital for you, as it's essential to not have temptations around for you to be able to stay on the wagon.

The person you were seeing is equally allowed to not be okay with respecting those boundaries. He's within his rights to not be sober.

It just means you two are incompatible. Ultimatums are often unreasonable and unnecessary - but this isn't one of those times where the ultimatum was bad.

You did what's right for you. You're not an asshole. 

Don't second-guess yourself; rather, be proud that you could stand up for your own needs.

Stay the course. You've got this."
e4ubvo,"YTA- Not for the rejection, but for the shirt.  You seem to only want to wear it to escalate the situation.  If you were just wearing it to wear it then that’s different.

It’s not appropriate for him to be keeping that. It’s explicit, and while we don’t know the relationship with the ex, I personally know I’d feel uncomfortable knowing my ex still had explicit images of me after a break up. Especially if he was with someone else.

e4xdp7,"YTA. It’s very sad that you dislike your daughter so much you would punish her and literally allow her to be homeless.

You say you’re just doing what your parents did to you but it’s hardly the same. You had the benefit of having your husband stand by you. He worked to support you while you stayed home with your children. Your daughter doesn’t have that. You are literally forcing your daughter and her infant out onto the street. You have a chance to help end the cycle of teenage pregnancy by watching your grandson so your daughter can get her education. Your grandson is statistically less likely to become a teen parent himself if he had a parent with a college degree.

Your daughter is 16. She is legally a child. If you are in the US you are not allowed to make her leave home, it is against the law to force your minor child to live on her own. She and your grandson could end up in CPS custody if you do this. She’s not even old enough to sign a lease for an apartment, some places won’t even hire a 16 year old for a job."

At the very least your mom and grandmother should on top of things like his being up and making noise at 3 AM. A twelve year old should be asleep long before then during the school year.   
They also should know and care that he's tagging, especially if he's so dumb as to use his own name. This could get him into legal trouble. It could also escalate into worse vandalism.

e4xmf8,"NTA it doesn't sound like 'you're no longer in the honeymoon stage' it sounds like he is completely disinterested in the relationship.

If he can't be bothered to talk to you for 10 minutes without napping, but he can video chat with his family for 5 hours straight, I think you know where you stand. Personally I think he's TA for stringing you along and not just telling you he isn't that into you."
e4xn4j,"You guys have some serious issues if you guys are communicating this poorly. Or, on his side, not communicating at all."
e4xo72,"NTA. Quit if you feel that's the best option for you. Consider putting the reason you quit in writing to your manager (and if applicable, to their boss/HR) because you never know when you'll need the documentation to back you up."
e4xoed,"NTA. Not really the sub for this, but note the drama and remember that it will never stop. If you don't want the drama, don't hang out with these people. You are the company you keep."
e4xp3m,"NAH. You and your boyfriend clearly had different views on how much communication was necessary. I understand you getting upset, especially because the project was kind of your project, too. I understand him just wanting to relax and figuring a generic answer would be ok. You both are in the clear, but in the future try to be clearer on what kind of communication you want."
e4xpqr,"NTA, also not the sub for this, try relationship_advice or relationships."
e4xsh8,"NTA/NAH

This all depends on how accurate their statement that they were busy working is.

Obviously you aren't the asshole, because it sounds like you pretty much have it your all and your request wasn't unreasonable; however if they *were* actually busy, you can't really blame them for not taking up the work that you were meant to do.

Also, if S focused on the wrong thing *by mistake* then he also can't be blamed, we're all human. Of course, if he was just pissing about then he's an asshole."
e4xv6d,"NTA but your fiance is. 

He didn’t do the bare minimum of running the dates by people who he needs/really wants to come. 

You just made these plans and your wedding is over a year away. You haven’t even sent out invitations it sounds like. So, I don’t understand why rescheduling is so impossible for y’all if you really want him to come. Is the church really so in demand you can’t find another date?

The fact your in-laws are refusing to discuss the wedding at all now makes me feel like something more is going on."
e4xxe0,"YTA - Visit friends and loved ones while you can. You never know if something horrible will happen to them. Especially if they live far away, take the opportunity to see them. i think since you haven't flown in so long, maybe that could make up for it?  your morals are totally valid but I think you should reconsider your current decision. Is there another mode of transportation? Maybe look into other options."
e4xy87,"YTA, but a very light one. You had spent the whole of this trip knowing you were behind, but made no effort to get ready early on the day of leaving.

There's no reason, though, that the friend on your flight couldn't have waited. Then you would have had someone to walk with, and the friends on the earlier flight could still make their flight."
e4y2wg,"I feel like we need a little more context than this but you are never the asshole for removing toxic people from your life. So even without much information, my judgment is NTA."
e4y4s5,NTA. Relationships with in-laws can be so difficult to navigate. Yours don’t seem to be very understanding people at all.
e4y90y,"NTA. Your kid has no decent immune system yet so its a valid concern to have them around another sick child. Also, if your wife is just 3 weeks post c-section, she should still be resting up, shouldn’t be carrying a car seat, etc."
e4ycsr,Hell no. Definitely NTA for your neighbors mooching off the kindness of your parents. They are even bigger As for trying to guilt trip you by sending their young kids to get you to turn it back on. I sincerely hope your parents cut them off for being such scumbags.
e4ymd3,"NTA your parents’ reaction to learning that you have a working memory is strange. I’d give it back to them like when they say “OP is so petty he’ll remember for a decade”, tell them it’s normal for brains to retain information and if need help remembering which door is their bedroom tell them you’ll lead them by the arm to remind them which one. 
   Same with the “I hope OP doesn’t go snitching” nonsense. Laugh at their immature reaction and flat out tell them to Grow Up. That’s the sort of crap that little kids say to pretend that they’re tough."
e4ynyl,NTA Just tell her you won't be involved with her bridesmaid drama.  It's not your job to mediate things for her.
e4yqhu,YTA. If you have a certain way you want your clothes put away then he should leave it out after they’re clean for you to put away in your specific way
e4yrda,"NTA - they stayed in your house and didn't keep it clean, and then went into your bedroom and your private bathroom without asking FIRST? No way. They've been weird as hell."
e4ytal,"

Judging by the fact that you don't know the difference between taught and thought, I would stop worrying about what other people know. YTA.

>He became even more upset when I mentioned that I though this was basic knowledge that people get thought in elementary school, and repeated until high school."
e4ytp9,"NTA 

You have to take care of yourself as well. Take some time to recharge and don't feel guilty about it."
e4yvxj,"YTA, but mildly. Wearing headphones, whether fully or one in one out, signals to your family that you’re busy and don’t want to talk to them. That’s fine when it’s occasional, but not when you’re always doing it. You’re putting them in the position where they feel like they *always* have to interrupt you in order to talk to you, and that can’t be pleasant for them."
e4ywh6,"NTA. This woman wants your forgiveness so she can die feeling guilt free (to put it bluntly). If you’re not capable of that or ready to, that’s on her. She’s had a lifetime to connect and form a relationship with you, you’ve reached out to her over and over, you should not feel guilty for not wanting to give her your forgiveness (even if you feel it is not owed because you are thankful for being adopted). She shouldn’t have waited until her time was finite, this seems more like a selfish maneuver on her part. It’s for her, not you. Don’t let people guilt you, do what’s best and right for yourself. 


Will it matter to you after she’s been gone for a few years and didn’t get the chance to forgive her? If you think your stance could change in the future, I would consider it."
e4ywvx,"Sorry, but YTA here. The issue isn't that you spent Thanksgiving with friends. The issue is that you traveled to a new city with your mother on a very special, family-centric holiday and then left her on her own so that you could spend time with your friends instead. It you wanted to spend the holiday with your friends, then perhaps this was NOT a trip you should have taken with your mother."
e4yyx2,"NAH

Here’s why, if your son has consistent time management issues this is something I’d consider looking in to. Because if the root cause is something like a executive dysfunction, this “teaching” method won’t make a dent. This doesn’t read as malicious on your part. I don’t think your wife is being an abject asshole, nor your son."
e4z3sy,"NTA, I used to feel bad about leaving retail jobs because I liked the people I work with. But at the end of the day, retail workers are so easily replaceable and corporations will f you over at any moment for a chance at more profit, so I don’t think you should feel bad in the slightest."
e4z44t,NTA. Pay child support and be done with it. An absent parent is much better than one who doesn't want to be there.
e4z45e,YTA for placing the blame on your sister when it’s your parents who are shit heads
e4zdwn,"Run... don’t walk. 

Try a different sub, you need relationship advise, not this."
e4zfpg,"NTA

Ditch her, she sounds draining. 

There's no point sacrificing your enjoyment."
e4zjjc,"NTA.

Your sister sounds entitled and I wouldn’t share it either, if the person simply assumed they could have it without asking first. The balls on that one.

But I’m also super into not sharing food unless I feel like it. I’ll share anything except food, to be honest. And only two or three people can take my food without me getting slightly annoyed."
e4zk4z,"Not necessarily an asshole, but you're an idiot for using a phrase you didn't understand."
e4zm0e,"ESH. You need to agree on how you;re going to handle this as a couple.

I'll add that I'm not American, and there seems to be an emphasis there on encouraging children to actually believe in Santa Claus, even at the age where they're beginning to question it, but I personally don't see why you can't enjoy Christmas traditions without actually insisting on their veracity. If your son's ""appearing to believe for your sake,"" it's gone too far.

>So AITA for just wanting to have a few special Christmases with my son?

That's actually a loaded question, because nobody - not even your wife - is suggesting that you can no longer ""have special Christmases with your son."" I think if you compromise with her, you'll be reminded of really matters here, and that's that you all find a way to enjoy Christmas together."
e4znb9,"YTA. 

Every dog is “well-behaved” until they aren’t."
e4zsva,I'm not going to lie. I had a really hard time reading this. But NTA because you stuck by your friend. People need more ride or die friends in their lives.
e4zu27,"NTA. As a knitter, in a family of “makers”, your brother’s reaction is appalling. Keep your keepsakes away. For now. Your nieces/nephews may learn the value of such love-gifts in the future. 

Also, I’ll gladly accept these creations 😂"
e4zwxv,"ESH. I agree that if she's at home with the children and you're working 12-hour days, the bulk of the cleaning should be her responsibility, and I'd say this if the genders were switched. But the way you said it was pretty disrespectful, and it sounds like you hadn't actually discussed the division of chores before, you just made an assumption. Looking after two children under 3 is hard work, and I wouldn't mind betting by the time you get home she's exhausted and has no idea where the time went. You both need to talk this over, and cut each other some slack.

>I make fairly good money and she is VERY comfortable with her spending.

That's a separate issue. You can't just throw in everything you don't like about your wife and hope it will influence judgments in your favour."
e5004n,"> I work out regularly with equipment I bought with scholarship money.

...Why didn't that money go towards your college tuition?

> I refused to get a job like a regular person and stayed home with the promise that I'd make something happen and eventually become independent through creating an online business. I haven't left since. That was 3 years ago.

YTA. Emotional reparations? Please; you're just a run of the mill leech."
e503v7,"NTA.

Which family members are complaining? You should talk to your dad directly about this. He is the only one that actually knows if he appreciates what you give him.

If he likes and uses your gifts, isn't that the whole  point? Should you give him a silk tie that he'll only use once in a while? Or another pair of slippers or mittens?

It sounds to me like your family members are getting their undies in a twist over how much you are spending on his gifts. And they know that they'd be assholes to gripe about that, so instead they gripe about ""utility,"""
e503wr,"NTA. I feel like you shouldn’t have called her a bitch, just should’ve said no and left it at that"
e504vc,"NTA.

Wtf this has nothing to do with you. If my in-laws were this crazy I'd be doing nothing but making popcorn."
e50845,"Yta if you actually used the phrase “my destiny lies elsewhere.” Otherwise I’d suggest you lighten up a little on the hometown hate, but it doesn’t make you an asshole to want to do something different from your old friends."
e508o1,Are you actually going to end a friendship for such a stupid reason? A trolley? Of all things?
e509q0,"ESH

She sucks for obvious reasons.

You responded to her bitching about you being unfair by turning around and actually being unfair. And you're shooting yourself in the foot- if you're really giving her way too much work, then she will be able to compile evidence and eventually your bosses will notice, and then you'll probably lose your delegating privileges in general.

Assign her stuff you don't like, that's fine, but don't blatantly give her a disproportionate amount to do."
e50at3,NTA. You were 30. The implication that you didn't/don't know what you want/don't want at 30 is astounding.
e50c7m,"YTA -- Don't call out, that's fine. But then find some way to get your own grown ass to work. 

You can't try to force your mother to drive in conditions she's not comfortable with while simultaneously going on about how you refuse to drive because you once got in an accident, right? That's be bonkers. Did I mention YTA? Drive yourself or hush up and call out."
e50c8p,"NTA It's your house, you get to decide who/what comes into it. Your friend is probably upset they can't smoke with you and are taking it out wrongly."
e50ekj,"NTA especially if comments in the paper don’t match the grade on the rubric. The problem with their swapping system is that it opens you up to bias from other teachers. Asking from a second opinion, if not from your teacher, then from a 3rd teacher, seems reasonable."
e50evd,YTA for deliberately using the wrong pronouns. No wonder your daughter (who is too young to be TA) doesn’t want this girl there. Children learn from their parents.
e50fcl,"NAH

You were grateful and polite. You can't change your feelings.

Can you ask your Dad to help set up the new computer in a way that is comfortable for you to work? It sounds like he is knowledgeable and skilled. That will show him you really do appreciate the gift, and help you get the best out of it"
e50j82,"NTA Even is there was something wrong in the towel closet, having them neatly folded will help.  If she had told you the issue, you could have fixed/moved them around to her liking.   
Sounds like she was in a lot of pain and that her pain isn’t managed very well (maybe she can’t afford medication?). Hopefully she will calm down and appreciate your efforts."
e50kgp,"While it's alsways objectively true you only get to hear one side of the story,this one just feels extra onesided.

>I was best friends with this woman for years, let's call her Pamela. We had our ups and downs, but always stayed strong, and we always had each other. The recent years I've expanded my social network quite a bit, and as a result I think she started to get insecure.

Your story of what went wrong ends with an assumption. That's never good because it means you two never got to talk that shit out. That's what happens sometimes.

You make Pamela sound like a toxic bitch, but I'm sure Pamela could make you sound like a toxic bitch in a reddit post too.

You need the judgement of friends or family who has a chance at knowing both parties.

Reddit will keep telling you NTA because of your extremely onesided portrayel of Pamela as a complete asshole."
e50paq,"NTA

Client was informed what was required to achieve what they asked for. Client failed to provide such conditions. I wouldn’t edit the photos beyond what you would have if you had gotten your photo spot. If they want you to heavily retouch or edit the photos to mimic what they WOULD have gotten, I feel that’s extra hours on your part and so would require a additional compensation."
e50qc7,"Hmm... is this an AITA issue?

It sounds like your mom has some issues, because she isnt really acting or presenting herself the way an adult should. I think you need to talk to your father about your concerns."
e50uqm,she definitely needs to pay you but asking original price for a 6 year old laptop is ridiculous
e50w8i,"NTA, if they weren't letting you participate after you asking multiple times then theres not really anything good for you to say about them, group activities are supposed to be group efforts that everyone works on together"
e51143,[deleted]
e512ru,"YTA, you're living in her house and she's been kind enough not to charge you rent. Get your self one of those insulated lunch bags that can be put in the fridge. Pack yourself a lunch from the left overs when the food is ready, or just use your words and ask your mom and boyfriend to save a little food for your lunch. You don't sit up in her house, living rent free and then have the audacity to refuse to offer her dinner."
e512zs,"NTA. The wedding is the most important thing to your sister, your classes are the most important thing to YOU. Your mother is wrong for trying to pressure you into prioritizing the wrong thing. When a wedding is scheduled to take place \*right before\* the end of the semester, I think just managing to physically be present is all anyone should be expecting of you. That goes triple for a ""destination"" wedding.

I also think you should step down as the MoH in your sister's wedding. The MoH has a lot of responsibilities, and right now you don't have the time (or money) to take them on. So tell her you'd like to step down so that either one of her friends or maybe one of your SILs can take that role instead."
e51dil,"NTA because that place is a just bad for your health.

Don't avoid the conversation. Be very clear with your husband that why you can't go. Explain, that you are not saying this to criticize them, but their lifestyle has side effects, namely that they way they live is just bad for your health and you need to limit your exposure to it.

Avoiding confrontation is not healthy for a relationship. It just kicks the issue down the road and when it does come up it is 100 times worse."
e51fq3,"NAH

You need to discuss this. Calmly, lovingly, but you need to talk about it, before the resentment really kicks in.

My advice. One parent gets up and does everything each night, but you alternate nights. No reason for both of you to be awake."
e51ggh,"NTA

1. You got your grandmother's blessing
2. Your grandfather doesn't care. He's dead."
e51jyo,"NTA, i would not consider him a good guy. That is legetimate manipulation. He manipulates you into staying and profiting of your talents. I would report it to HR since if he did this to you, he will probably do it to someone else if he's never in trouble because of it"
e51l4j,"NTA, but I do think you could have done a tad better. It's completely understandable to kind of freeze up when someone else snaps, so I can't blame you for standing there and basically just thinking WTF, but it's not like her frustration came out of absolutely nowhere or was a frustration that you hadn't experienced yourself. You didn't have to back her up, but when she and the neighbor started arguing you could have intervened to try to mediate and maybe explain how you both have felt in the past in a less aggressive way in order to defuse the situation a bit. Your neighbor may still have been pissed, but it could have helped alleviate the situation a little too. And while your girlfriend's reaction towards you is a little inappropriate, I think maybe just take into account where she may be coming from. Clearly she's in the wrong, but it wouldn't hurt if you acknowledged to her that you completely understand why she would want you to have her back in any kind of stressful situation, even if she was very obviously handling things in the wrong way in this instance."
e51m23,"NTA

You’re paying for a fair education, the laziness created an unfair advantage. I’d definitely report it."
e51mdb,"NTA. He has a chore, either complete or dont expect a prize for half assing it, especially if he knows that you’ll just swoop in and finish it. That’s a total dick move."
e51ng0,"NAH (I'm sticking strictly to the ticket conundrum and at any rate you've taken responsibility for the falling out)

""...COUPLE have decided they don’t want to continue with the friendship."" I think you and your BF have to respect that and leave them alone. Besides, I doubt they want to sit next to you two at this show. If they really want to go, they will buy their own tickets, I would think. Unless they are cheaper than they are offended."
e51oss,NTA. If this like a dormitory common room space it’s free use and it is a common room/area where in which people use it all the time. It isn’t part of her room it’s part of the shared agreement that you have
e51pd1,"ESH, but I understand where you're coming from. Your stepmom is clearly the asshole, and you responded in an asshole manner, but as a fellow clothing reseller the thought of someone carelessly trashing a freaking BURBERRY BLAZER would probably drive me off the deep end too. Basic human decency indicates that if you borrow something from someone, ask first, and if you damage it, apologize and do what you can do to fix it. The fact that your stepmom has done neither is unfortunate, and you don't deserve to be treated that way. 

But with that said, to be frank, what's right and wrong doesn't matter in this instance. Your dad has demonstrated that she's on her side regardless of whether or not she's wrong, and the two of them are in control of your living situation. So, deal with it in whatever way is easiest for you, and be glad that they won't be in control of it for much longer."
e51q0h,"Do you have to say it?

Can you make socializing with them a dine-out situation? Stay in a hotel and dine out.

NTA"
e51szf,You don't use enough periods.
e51tz0,"NTA, you've split up and if she wants to choose a low paying career that's on her. I'd suggest getting a lawyer though as it sounds like she's counting on child support to bank roll her income above needs for the child, especially as you have  him almost 50% of the time."
e51vp1,NTA It's the MoH's job to organize the bachelorette party. You give your input and she ultimately does the scheduling or organizing. I don't blame you for wanting to be the lead in something like that.
e51w4m,"I dont think yta for receiving the gift, but yta for discounting your partner's feelings about it. It may be nothing to you, but its clearly not to him. it's not fair to your current relationship to put a past partner's desire to give gifts above your current partners (reasonable) discomfort with it."
e51yhd,"NTA. Bedbugs will not go away. They will multiply and everyone in her house will eventually get them, then their homes will be invested. 

There are a very small percentage of people who for whatever reason don't get bitten by bedbugs. Maybe she is one of these people. Has she been bit? She would have red itchy welts if she has. 

Regardless of whether or not she is bitten by them most of her friends at parties will get them and they are really bad. So you should tell everyone for their own protection."
e51ymb,"NTA

Pay her back for the meals, the rest is yours."
e51za7,"Girlfriend here. First off, it's ADD, not OCD. Second, I never asked you to come because I know it irritates you. I was perfectly content to do the shopping on my own, and then as I was leaving you told me, completely unprompted, ""don't take 2 hours about it this time."" When I asked what that meant you had a go at my shopping by recipe.

I do find it easier to shop by recipe because I'm still figuring out my medication for my, again, ADD, the symptoms of which include lack of attention to detail, forgetfulness, and, shockingly, attention deficit. If I have a list done by recipe then it helps me keep track of what I'm getting and I know that I need to get this, that and the other for Monday and this, those and these for Tuesday ect so I don't lose track. I've tried other methods, and I'm sure there are other methods I could use, but this one is the one I happen to find easiest. I've tried going by category but that leads to me forgetting something or not getting enough of something.

He did say it drove him crazy, which pissed me off because he uses it the way someone else would use ""babe"", as in greeting me with ""hey crazy"". I've asked him to stop multiple times because I really hate being called crazy but he still does it.

And then, to top it all off, he posts this extremely biased account to make me seem MORE crazy hoping it'll shame me into changing my shopping method.

YTA."
e521go,"If you have to ask, don't do it."
e523cg,"NTA. The smell of smoke is nasty, and I wouldn't be able to handle that either."
e527pq,"ESH
Coworker for kissing you knowing you have a bf.

Bf for telling you not to tale the ride home, but not coming to get you because he's ""hanging out"". That's a saftey issue. Seems like he doesn't care if you're safe.

You for not telling the coworker it was inappropriate and not telling your bf what happened."
e527yt,"NTA. Honestly I’m a spiteful bitch, it’d be fun to watch her open that box."
e52b8e,"YTA - it's a lot of money and you're allowed to be annoyed about it, but be so privately or to people who didn't know and aren't grieving over your grandmother.

What good did you honestly think was going to come from complaining about it to your siblings who are grieving? You had the good sense not to complain about it to your mom since it's not her issue to deal with, what made you think it was ok not to extend that courtesy to your siblings?"
e52boc,"YTA 
She's known him longer than you. You trust her to look after your baby. She's a reliable, trustworthy person.
She took an eleven year old to McDonald's on his birthday. Even if he ate the saltiest, fattiest, most sugar drenched thing on the menu it was one meal and won't harm him. It's a fun trip for a kid, especially if it's not something he gets to do often.

She took him to visit her family, presumably because they've known him for a long time and wanted to wish him a happy birthday. That's kind and a chance for him.to meet people outside his usual social group

What's particularly concerning is that an experienced professional who knows your stepson very well says she ""feels sorry for him"" and you dismissed her concerns.  
I think you should speak to get further and find out what she means, and if there's something wrong"
e52dls,NTA. This is why one has to be so careful when blending families. To go from having a room to being made to feel like a guest hurts. There should have been some conversation before any renovations happened. Give your dad a chance though. He knows he messed up and does want to fix it
e52gfx,"ESH.  Your brother isn't even required to give anyone gifts, but giving used and damaged gifts is tacky.  If you aren't eating for a week, you're spending too much on gifts.  Stop trying to make up for the kids lives by getting them expensive gifts and expecting anyone else to give expensive gifts."
e52h58,NTA - she is scared of the doctor and blame is easier to go with than fear.
e52ln4,"NAH

Mate don't be stupid, this was a golden opportunity. That woman deserves a gift after that lmao."
e52m6l,"NTA. This is unacceptable behavior. I am surprised how nobody seems to have noticed that she propositioned your son. The fact that your girlfriend is still willing to let her within range of your son speaks very poorly of her judgment.

Both you and your girlfriend have the right of veto-power over who gets to visit and this seems a good case to enforce it."
e52n2i,"YTA - you would rather others get more $ than your grandpa?  I don't think you realize how tough it is to save up $, let alone your grandpa sacrificing his own retirement and wealth so you can go to college. 

10 years later you may stumble upon this thread and realize how ridiculous this question is."
e52nc0,Nta. That's a stupid reason to get mad about something. Its fucking makeup.
e52nfi,"NTA. Many have this problem, me included. I cannot stand loud chewers and feel a sort of fight or flight response. I just turn the tv up louder or make sure not to sit too close because I risk getting frustrated and lashing out."
e52p3o,"NAH

They are not assholes for asking for help. You are not an asshole for refusing to give them money.  You are not an asshole for offering them money under certain conditions (ie they make a move that you believe will reduce their future need for financial help), since they can either accept it or not."
e52p97,"NTA. Your boyfriend sounds like one of those insane people who think they are so nice for treating animals like they are children. A cat doesn't know what 'I'll give you up for adoption means'. My cat doesn't know what I mean when I say 'keep waking me up at 6 am, you asshole, and I'll turn you into a fur collar'."
e52qlv,"YTA big time. It's your fault you hadn't slept in 48 hours. It's your fault you were driving dangerously, and you could have killed someone. It's your fault you slept through your alarm. And it's your fault you got replaced. The director should have replaced you sooner. You had the lead role and couldn't be bothered to make rehearsal."
e52sck,"NTA. 

He is kinda putting you out by using the garage. Instead of trying to get money for it, just don't let him park in the garage. 

""hey, it is starting to snow, I am gonna start using my garage!""

If he pushes back, then ask him to start paying you for it."
e52xnt,"NTA. That's exactly how it works, they won't be taking over your existing account - they'll be starting a new one. Call the utilities companies and tell them you want your account closed on X date. Let the roommates know your account is closing the day you move out, and that they can call to set up a new account to avoid service being interrupted. If their utilities get cut off it will 100% be on them."
e52yg6,"NTA

You're allowed to end friendships."
e530dr,"NAH

Yeah, it's a diet cookbook...for the diet she is explicitly on. I think it's a thoughtful gift."
e5317o,Ethical it ain't!!! But I would keep it 100%. Amazon it a notorious tax dodger and piss poor company to work for. Low wages and harsh conditions. Fuck em
e531ru,[deleted]
e5343a,"NTA. 

Emily thinks she has it bad? My husband died. Emily’s not allowed to feel/express her pain because I have it worse. How inconsiderate of her to talk about her military boyfriend when there are actual SPOUSES that have been widowed.  - editing to note that this is sarcasm.

Tell I said her she’s being a self-obsessed jerk. Her experience should be teaching her compassion."
e539er,"General rule of thumb, you dont step between siblings. Ever. No matter the argument, as long as it doesnt get physical. NTA."
e53bta,"YTA, twice over.

If dog poop is a problem, the DNA testing seems like a necessary step. But DNA tests cost money, so SOMEONE has to pay for it. If you're not charged that fee, that essentially means that it will be charged to everyone in the building by being bundled in with rent or whatever other fees you pay to management. To me, seems only fair that dog owners should pay for their dogs. Just like you don't know who it is, no one else in the building knows for sure that it's not you.

You're especially the asshole for being such a prick about a $30 fee that the staff were avoiding you. It didn't ""pay off."" You sold your dignity for $30."
e53dzs,NTA. Your sister in law sounds like she was being purposely obtuse and ignoring you so she could keep behaving how she wanted to.
e53fgq,"NTA. You did handle it correctly, very correctly. It is insulting, asking someone to bark like a dog for a bigger tip. Everything you said and did was right, and the guy made a fuss because he was embarrassed, as he should've been. Not the asshole, good for you!"
e53isz,"YWBTA if you tried to control what you’re employees wearing because it’s reminding you of your ex. It may be hers it may not be hers, maybe she just bought it because she liked it on her friend. Sorry about your break up but man don’t freak out on your coworker for the clothes they are wearing."
e53k13,"NTA. He's not your responsibility and you owe him nothing. His children can pay if they're that concerned, and can split the cost between them. If you're interested, maybe offer to chip in, but don't feel obligated to do so."

e53rl7,i think you’re making the conflicting birthdays an issue way too early...due dates can be sort of arbitrary. i’m one of 3 and none of us were actually born on our due date. seems like an unnecessary conflict to bring up with your already upset wife IMO
e53sqt,YTA for posting this when you know you're not TA of this story
e53vjw,"NTA - he crossed a line, and you were direct in asking him to dial it back.  He doesn’t need to be attracted to you in order to violate your personal boundaries.  His friends may think you were rude because many young people (girls especially) are conditioned to always be polite and not make others feel unwanted or unliked.  However, you have valid reasons for pulling back and no obligation to extend friendship to someone who makes you uncomfortable.  Your ability to be direct and communicate your feelings clearly will serve you well in life."
e53vqa,"NTA. She's three. Dates don't mean *anything* to her. It'd be different if she were like 8 and you were just flat out lying to someone who can tell time and read a calendar, but at three years old, having Christmas 3 days later isn't going to change anything."
e53wih,"NTA. If they don’t treat you kindly, you aren’t obligated to spend your holiday with them."
e53y14,"YTA. You sound exhausting. Why not apologize for something you feel you've done wrong, first, instead of waiting for her to come to you? You are the asshole for being ""picky' with apologies."
e53zl3,"NAH. You aren’t obligated to meet someone you don’t want to, but I think you should really think about it before you decline."

Can you take them with you? That might be a good teachable moment... them coming home to an empty house with no explanation."
e54cms,"YTA- This is a perfect example of elderly people being treated without  respect. It seems to me that as soon as someone is viewed as ""insignificant"" in society  they are open for public humiliation, scorn, ignoring their existence or general disrespt. When you live with someone you experience their personal moments and it is simple common sense to preserve your roommate, family member, spouse, children's privacy out of basic repsect and honoring the space that is shared by keeping your big mouth shut.  If you haven't already please hand write a letter of deep regret and offer to ammend the wrong doing.  Also, sincerely ask if there were other reasons she evicted you so rapidly because this sounds like the last straw that broke the camel's back, not the first offense."
e54deo,"NTA

Was it snarky? Sure, but this person was being an absolute dick to people who have no choice but to be polite because they're at work. People like that deserve a little reality check and you were in a position to give it to him. Fuck people who feel like they can talk down to others just because they're not in a position to defend themselves."
e54geg,"YTA

so you're excluding them because they (presumably) don't drink...

and because they (presumably) don't drink they won't be fun??

these are her friends and if the purpose of this trip is to spend it with other couple friends then yes, YTA. she even offered a compromise of another location but you don't think that's fun either?

maybe you're the one who isn't fun."
e54hky,"NTA

While disabled people also have a right to earn a living, if they are claiming disability and working more than the permitted hours, it is fraud. People like that make it so much harder for those who genuinely need help. And if it turns out that they are within their allowance, honestly, there is no harm done.

However, I also wouldn't continue to work somewhere where the hours were that fickle. Are your hours contracted or do they change week on week?"

But you should accept the position of supervisor. It will look better on your resume and will likely be for more pay. If you are going to be working there, you might as well be machiavellian about it.

Keep the work relationships cordial as well. Don't have to be close friends, but you never know when a work acquaintance now could be a useful connection in the future."
e54va2,"NTA - I have a great dislike for HOAs but this is the reason why they exist, so if they are going to exist (and you're going to be paying the dues for it) then you might as well use it to justify having your neighbor clean up his shit.

I’ve been stuck on the subway before for well upwards of 30 minutes, so it definitely happens (and indeed happens pretty often). 

You say this is totally unlike her, so instead of being worried about her, you leave the restaurant. She texted you at 7:38p and called you multiple times (just like you did). You didn’t check your phone for 20 minutes because you were on the subway and there’s no signal."
e550wr,"YTA.

Damn. This is cold. Your wife stopped to help someone else bring a new life into the world, and you're worried you lost some ""me time""? She then offered to make up for it, and that wasn't good enough?

This is very petty. You are 100% TA."
e55163,"NAH

She doesn't need her own room, but not having one pretty much says it's not her home. I moved away for almost 8 years and when I came back home, my room was there for me.

You couldn't afford the house. That's understandable, but just because your daughter is an adult now doesn't mean she can't have her own feelings regarding it."
e552i1,"NAH

This seems like a kid just not fully understanding a situation, which happens all the time. What are the chances she's already familiar with how a financial loan works? I don't think she was being a brat on purpose, that's a *lot* of money to a 12 year old. 

I also don't think you were wrong to ask for it, or to use authority when she refused. I think getting to the family Thanksgiving is more important than making a 12-year-old happy. In fact, good on you for offering the extra $5 if she would help. As long as you refunded her, all will be forgiven later in her life and this will be a silly story for family gatherings."
e552vp,YTA. MEPS is so easy to reschedule that it is actually offensive that you think it is more important than seeing your sister graduate. Whats worse is you know that is something you CAN reschedule. Whats worse is you decided to be an even bigger prick and try to compare your Father NOT BEING ALLOWED to return for important events to you NOT WANTING to go to your sisters important events. Instead of making excuses just tell your sister that you dont care shes graduating and you have no plans to improve the relationship between the two of you.

I can't really judge this as it seems like you want the best for the cat but contact the ""owner"" first. I personally think the cat is better off with you.

e55m29,"NTA. She's being really immature, and she needs to realize that there's more to life than sex."

Additionally, your kids have an absolute right to their DNA.  Read the fine print on 23 & me, they own the DNA.  We don't know what the next 100 years will bring in terms of genetics and DNA strands.  Protect your kids.  Your unfounded doubt is no reason to hand their DNA over to third parties."

No offense, but you sound really immature. The fact you can barely control yourself when your partner needs to abstain from sex and are upset that he doesn’t want you to jerk him off into a cup is honestly extremely bizarre. I have genuinely never even heard of someone’s partner assisting in sperm sample collection. That just seems awkward and like it could even contaminate the sample.

Work on self restraint and take a moment to realize that not EVERYTHING has to be done together, especially when he firmly tells you no. You are not entitled to his body. If you want to have a child and healthy marriage, you also need to work on your communication with your husband.

Edit: Your post history shows you have a horrible relationship with your underage stepdaughter to the point you want to move out for the nights when she visits?? This whole situation seems like a recipe for disaster. You need to talk to your husband at the very least, learn about boundaries, and work on maturing."

Edit-to-your-edit: These are all just justifications and excuses for doing what we're telling you (and you must know) is wrong.

Honestly, I was upset when I first found out my boyfriend had one. I felt like it was nicer looking than my parts and maybe even better feeling. It was smooth, never had to be shaved and never had razor burn. It was intimidating and I couldn’t understand why.

My boyfriend was always fine with me using my vibrator during sex, so I felt out of line.
I had to come back to reality. I will always be better than a sex toy. Once I understood this I even used it on him during sex. I believe that we are afraid of things that we don’t understand and things were are not use to. I was fine after that. It’s a toy, it does the same thing as his hand. He still always wants the real thing.

e59jst,YTA for even adding this into your decision of who to let go. Watching your child is not a part of their job description and you should really figure out your own childcare. It's ridiculous to ask a subordinate to babysit for you on the job.
e59ktr,"ESH.  Instagram presents an idealized version of life, a fantasy, this isn't new information.  I would directly confront your mom about this, tell her how uncomfortable you are with the way she portrays the family on Instagram and forces the kids the do stuff.

e59kwx,"This is way above this sub’s paygrade. Your spouse is is depressed and likely in crisis. You leaving won’t make it better, but he’s not TA for suggesting it. He really needs to see someone ASAP. And you need to not take his irrational ideas personally."

I don't blame them from cutting ties with you. They may come around eventually but you probably severed some serious bonds, at least with the older two.

At the very least, it would have been better for your wife to go alone and do a long distance relationship with your wife instead of your kids. This would have worked better if your wife would later be able to transfer back. Or I'd be more understanding if you were on the verge of homelessness. 

No halfway decent parent would chose a dream job over their children. No halfway decent parent should chose a spouse iver their minor children."
e59wi0,"Oh NTA. I often believe that if someone overlooks racism/transphobia/homophobia in terms of people they associate with, then it reflects on their own opinions/beliefs too.

You did right in cutting her out, although, I do advise you give her an explanation. Something simple on the lines of “Hey Anna, I’m sorry but I feel we are no longer on the same page and feel our friendship has ran it’s course. I find (said friends) behaviours unacceptable and cant bring myself to associate with them or anyone else who can willingly accept such toxic behaviours/beliefs.

YTA.

You  insisted on reading his manuscripts and then told him they are utter hot garbage and would rather read the future in the shit-filled diapers of the local dementia ward of the elder care hostel than pick up his work and read it for pleasure.

As a professional writer, I can assure you two things:

If you think your writing is beautiful and godly and ""life's work"" - it sucks.

If you think your partner is a good test audience for your ""life's work"" - you aren't looking for honest feedback, you're looking for delusional support.

You're only the asshole because of the way you handled the situation - in the most crushingly painful way you possibly could have handled it.

Look, my friends and writing partners have had a straight-up agreement: we have a common goal in mind, which is to get honest, useful feedback that we can use to build out our fiction work. It's all practice until one of us gets the best-selling novel - even the stuff that DOES get published.

But I gotta tell you that what you did was quite possibly the one thing I have told everyone in any writing group or any ""new novel writer"" group is the single thing NOT TO EVER DO TO ANYONE YOU JUST MET.

And you did it to your husband.

Let that sink in for a minute.

You did something that I will ban people for life from a writing group and tell them not to let the door hit them in the ass on the way out. You did something that is so completely uncool that just forwarding this to another writer whom I work with in another city said, ""Holy shit, what's this person's name? They sound just like this woman I kicked out last week and told never to come back.""

And you did it TO YOUR HUSBAND.

God, are you EVER the asshole here. Not just mildly so, but on a whole different level.

Unsolicited from you would be just straight up insensitivity.

What you did was the equivalent of demanding to see someone's progress and then saying the whole thing was utter shit and demanding a match and a can of gas so you could burn it all down.

I'm going to tell you right now that if he doesn't divorce your ass, I'd be shocked. That's beyond disrespectful. That's abusive.

By the way, had anyone done something remotely CLOSE to this in a writing group that I mediate, that person would be banned and blacklisted from all local writing groups. It's happened before. What you did is so far off the pale it's not even funny.

I hope that one day you find yourself in this situation, where you offer the core of yourself to someone you love because they insist that you should because you love them so much...

...and they drop it on the ground and proceed to shit on it as thoroughly as you've shit on your husband's.

Damn, you suck.

e5axtb,"YWB-NTA if you're doing it just to get your dad a hoodie from the team he likes. However, YTA because you're doing it with the intent of replacing a gift you didn't deem good enough. Was what your step mom gave him a licensed product? No. But it was made from the heart. Money wasn't an issue, as you said. Sometimes people have trouble shopping for others when money isn't an issue because, what do you get someone who can buy whatever they want? So she did something thoughtful and I'm sure put a lot of time and effort into it. The action isn't the problem on your end, it's the intent behind it. Much like the intent behind her gift two years ago was love."

e5b13g,YTA because he’s literally just trying to be a good partner. If you’re as good friends as you say you should be happy he’s treating his partner well. He didn’t say no he just said he needed to check. That’s the correct response. It’s incredibly disrespectful to make plans on someone else’s behalf and then have that person be the asshole by having to decline later etc. Your birthday is on a popular night. Surely you have accepted by now that you have to kind of let go of the expectations that people will prioritize your birthday over anything else (excluding family and partners of course). I have a similarly popular birthday. It’s hard but honestly saves a lot of disappointment when I just accept that a lot of people will be busy and it doesn’t mean they don’t care about me

e5b3j7,"Hmmm gonna go with NAH. You may be misinterpreting how your sister feels about you. I would assume that she loves you and wants you to be involved in one of the biggest days of her life, not just to be an observer. I wasn’t there, but I think you may have just misread her tone when she asked. At the same time, she needs to recognize that you have physical and mental limits that you cannot necessarily overcome. You two should work out a way for you to be involved in the wedding (not necessarily a part of the bridal party) that is comfortable for you both."
e5b3xj,YTA. Put your stuff away. It's not your dad or brother's job to gently put your things away -- it's your job.

e5b67p,"YTA for trying to parent him. You are doubly the asshole for recommending a pseudoscientific, discredited ""medical"" practice to him.

Nothing she did prevents you from dumping him.  You had the exclusive talk, yet he was dating other girls.  His ""story"" shouldn't matter, you should immediately dump him.

Getting pissed at your friend is only going to hurt you in the long run.  You become the girl that no one wants to tell the truth because you take it out on the wrong person.  

Apologize to your friend."
e5c97b,NTA tbh your dad is at fault if he thinks you’re really that much of a burden on the “SMITH” name then you should change it I guess but I mean try and see if you can work it out before doing anything at least try and seal the bandage before ripping it off

I think people will disagree with me, but personally, if you're comfortable, I don't feel like paying your sister's phone bill is much of an issue.

e5cxzx,"NAH, sure that mom said she's having a 'rough time', but it could be work related or something personal that she may or may not have wanted to discuss with you. I mean if you really wanted to know, you could go out for coffee or lunch with her and casually bring it up in a conversation by saying ""I'm a realtor and my husband does yadayada"" & you can describe how your job is to her. If she doesn't respond with what she does, then just understand she doesn't want you to know and leave that topic.

Also, your husband makes some valid points. If you already have an assistant, wouldn't it be better to give him the extra hours because he'll feel like you don't value him as an employee. If you do give this mom that position without talking to your other assistant and explaining as to WHY you're doing it, then YTA because that's disrespectful to the assistant.

I get you're trying to be a genuinely concerned person but you should talk to your husband and refocus your view."
e5cyq1,"NTA. If they loved you like a grandparent should, they would try to understand. They’re intentionally disrespecting you, and I don’t blame you one bit for not wanting to associate with them."
e5czjv,"NTA.

My wife and I had an open relationship, and despite my mom being ""moderately socially liberal,"" I still didn't think she'd fly with the whole thing so I lied about it constantly. Never once did I come out to her about it.

Given how off the rails she went about other (far more benign) things, I feel 1000% correct in my decision to do so. I wouldn't change a thing.

Fact is: Your lifestyle (and the labels that accompany it) are yours. You get to decide who to share them with, to what extent, etc. Clearly, after the first blowup, you knew that your mom wasn't as chillaxed as you; your peace of mind comes first, so you absolutely can and should choose how much to divulge/withhold.

Your mom needs to grow up; my mom did too. When you're gone and living your life (with all the people who make you happy and accept you), maybe she will; in the meantime, divulge details on a need-to-know basis and keep her in the dark lest you're willing to forfeit peace-of-mind."

It can be considered insulting to a chef, to add salt or pepper to a dish, without tasting it first.  How could you possibly know it needs seasoning without trying it first?

Similar idea with trying the vegetarian chili.

You weren't trying the vegetarian chili, you made your own concoction with the vegetarian chili as an ingredient.

One possible reason she could have taken offence, would be: you aren't giving vegetarian food a chance, if you have to add meat to it, before you give it a try.

It is one thing to say - ""Hey that looks good, can I try some?"" Try it, and find it less appetizing than you expected - then fix it.

It is an entirely different scenario to ask for it, then tell the very person who made it - it is unacceptable unless the forbidden fruit is added.

Not EXACTLY what you did, but kind of is."
e5d5v8,"YTA.  You took another persons stuff and just threw it away because it was negatively affecting you.  You mention you are selling your home and use this as a justification saying essentially that this was lowering your home value.  How do you think that that gives you the right to throw away someone else's belongings. 

&#x200B;

 A crappy car in someone else's home can negatively effect home prices for everyone in the neighborhood, do you think it would be appropriate for me to call a tow truck and have a neighbors car towed because I'm trying to sell my home?

&#x200B;

If you did that I'm pretty sure you and everyone else would acknowledge that you are the asshole?  What makes this situation different?  Is it because this guy is homeless?  If so you are essentially saying it is OK to harm people as long as they are defenseless."
e5d69q,"NTA - Address this immediately. Those excuses are practically triggering a PTSD episode on my end. They seem to think they have the upper hand in this situation by outnumbering you in how you feel about it vs. how they feel about it — **when how they feel about it is flat out inconsiderate, unfair and disgusting.** I went through the **exact same fucking thing** of two new roommates of mine befriending one another, both turning out to be slobs — and trying to gaslight ME in thinking I’M in the wrong for expecting basic sanitary living conditions for a shared space. When I think back to how infuriating this really was, my emotions about it still come out lol.

Thankfully in your situation it seems as though you have a third party who will handle it formally. In my instance, I only had a landlord who didn’t intervene or give a shit about anything other than collecting rent. It led to me having to leave notes, get in to screaming matches with them out of frustration, and eventually begin to send disgusting photos of their mess *(with flash on)* to them in group texts CONSTANTLY to annoy the fuck out of them, and leave their piles of dirty dishes in front of their bedroom doorways so that I could use the sink that I’m also entitled to.

Best of luck."

e5dc9j,"As someone who used to be super thin I can confirm that people make these kind of comments all the time. It's considered rude to comment on someone's body when they're fat, but perfectly normal when they are skinny - this is exactly what you have experienced here, the double standard. I can also confirm that it is definitely damaging to your self image as a skinny girl to constantly hear these kinds of things. Being too thin can be extremely unhealthy. When you identify as the skinny girl you often deliberately make choices to keep you skinny, because that's who you are. Like only eating half your meals, only choosing healthy food etc. Most of the time the people affected don't necessarily realise what they're doing. Some people take it too far and they become anorexic or bulimic. I have 2 sisters who have battled with eating disorders because of it. One is so bad she has ruined her teeth from vomiting (bulimic) and has to get regular IV nutrients just to stay alive. 

I realise you were standing up for your girl, and kudos to you for that. If you had omitted the word fat from your insult I'd be all for you, but knowing how bad body image issues are for so many people I have to say ESH. She shouldn't say what she said, but likely doesn't realise the impact of her statements. But on that same token, it's never ok to use language that makes someone feel bad about their body - fat or thin."

Gently tell him his son may not stay in the main house, but he's welcome to add a bed for his son in his own room.  At this stage of the divorce, there's a decent chance that will be acceptable as an interim living situation in the court's view, although he may need to find a real two bedroom apartment in the future.

You should absolutely be able to have your own stuff but it looks like you're going to have to hide it better.

e5glyz,"NTA. She was forewarned about you staying up late and you also agreed to adjust brightness/sound if it bothered her. She agreed. If she’s getting pissed off now, telling anyone other than you is exactly why the problem isn’t being resolved. I’m not sure if there might be more to it from her point of view but to me it seems like you should casually bring it up, just ask if it’s okay you still being on the computer late now that she’s getting into an earlier routine.  

Now that she’s getting up earlier it’s possible that she could be hoping to go to sleep earlier, too, but is pissed off that you hadn’t thought of that yourself so that she didn’t have to ask you to finish up earlier."

e5in15,"I’m gonna go against the grain here and say NTA. It sounds like OP has talked to husband and he has been unresponsive, instead turning it around on her, saying “why would you be upset I’m helping someone else?” when in fact he’s NOT helping someone else. He’s forcing HER to help someone else, when she already has a lot on her plate. 

Additionally, what OP has described doesn’t sound like “whining” to me. It sounds like someone who is pointedly communicating their needs more effectively, telling DH that they are overwhelmed and need help when they do. And DH’s response to this is to accuse her of whining, when his real complaint is that more is being expected of him and he doesn’t like it. Just because husband calls it whining, doesn’t mean it is. 

I’m really disappointed that people are telling OP they need to go back to being a doormat in order to save their marriage. OP, if your husband only wants you as a doormat and doesn’t respect your time, your health, or your feelings, is it really your responsibility to make him happy and salvage the relationship? It sounds like you both need to have a hardcore conversation about both your needs and come up with a compromise. 

And yes, he may have been this way all along and OP was fine being the doormat in the beginning of the relationship, when they were most likely younger, had less going on, were basking in the light of the honeymoon phase. But as the years go by, marriage gets harder, people learn and grow up and realize their needs are important to their mental health. 

OP - it doesn’t sound like you’re whining to me. Husband needs to step up his spouse game and listen to your concerns without turning them against you and gaslighting the conversation to make you feel like asking for your needs to be met is wrong."

Control them, do not let the kids use them at 2 in the morning, make safe decisions about their internet use.. 

But if you decide your children's relationship with their father is somehow something you can legislate, if he isn't being abusive, just because of how the court decided the custody, you will be SHOCKED when you realize that your children don't CARE what you think, and want a relationship with their father. 

As it turns out, whether the ex-wife likes it or  not, the father is still the father, and attempts to actively work against him having a relationship with his children WILL backfire. 

(note: I am the ex-wife and Mom, and this is my approach to my child's relationship with his father, that relationship is  important even if my relationship with the man didn't last)."

Keep up the good work and tell that player if they don’t like the way you DM, show them the door.

Your wife is not a child. This is not about what you allow or don't allow. Your wife should have free rein to make whatever choices she wishes to make. Giving her ultimatums or commands about how should relate to Jenny is controlling behavior.

You are, however, correct that it would be best if your wife never talks to Jenny again. Why? because this relationship puts your marriage at risk. If your wife values your marriage, she should stop having anything to do with Jenny.

So, what should you do?

e5lcxy,"YTA. I understand getting frustrated but that was completely uncalled for. She is scared, frustrated, and hormonal. Have some empathy! 

A better response would have been ""I know you're upset and probably scared and I want to help you but I can't if you don't let me. Having an unsafe abortion is completely unnecessary. You could die! If accepting the money is the problem, then you can pay me back for the procedure when you have the money. Call the clinic, book an appointment and I'll go with you so you're not alone. You said you want an abortion, so this is how it's going to get done.""

Yes, she's being irrational and understandably making you angry because of it. Your anger is justified. How you decided to respond and react is not justified. You cannot control how you feel, but you can control how you react to it."
e5ldhp,"NAH

But I would suggest you broach this subject very lightly since it is a very sentimental thing. I mean you could say that you would rather have your wedding band be a simple one that you wear day to day and save the meaningful one for special occasions. I mean idk what you do professionally and as hobbies, but I’m and outdoorsy type. My wife and I have both lost or broken multiple wedding bands (none were sentimental or super pricey for this reason). She’s on ring #3 and I’m on #2. Hell one ring, she was driving home one day from work with her windows down and her arm dangling out, it was a little chilly but still nice, fingers get a pinch smaller when cold, and her ring just fell off into a grown over ditch (we live in the boonies). I imagine your fiancé would be crushed if you lost the heirloom with something silly like that."

I’m guessing if the books have personal meaning then they’re good ones and so reach out

 “I’m sorry for your loss, I know I didn’t know your daughter well but I’m glad that I managed to share my love of (insert author) with her before she passed. There’s one particular quote from a book I lent which really resonated with me so I wanted to share this with you (insert quote).

It's also worth considering reporting him to the police if he's like this , as verbal and emotional abuse is still abuse. Take recordings if you can to use as evidence, should you need it.

She may be planning for a time in which she may be financially dependent on her son. It is a bit old fashioned, not unreasonable.

She may want to plan ahead for the quite probable future in which her son has children and might just want to make sure that if he does pass that the kids are looked after. Again, old fashioned but not a bad thing.

A serious muscle injury will take a lot longer to heal than a broken bone. The muscle cannot be immobilised for a length of time like a bone can. 

Doing a simple chore like washing some dishes can very easily aggravate the injury, and cause the muscle to swell, resulting in pain. 

I have a muscle injury - my lower back on the left side. It’s been two and a half years and I’m only about half way through a recovery. 

Your roommates injury will heal, but it will likely take a lot longer than three months. I’d expect a full recovery in around 12 months. 

If he’s able to do a chore with one hand, then he can do that. He can put clothes into the washing machine and turn it on. He can take the clothes out and put them in the dryer.
He can scrub the toilet bowl with one arm, and he can put away dishes with one arm. 

But don’t push him to do chores that in all likelihood will just aggravate his injury and cause him pain.

Edit: According to what I’ve read, it will take up to six weeks for the labrum to reattach itself to the bone, and another six weeks to strengthen. After that, you have to be very careful not to stress the injury - being so recently healed means there’s a higher risk of reinjury."

Your teacher is right... but - 

**You don't understand what your teacher is doing. I can't fault you for that.**

You will end up in this situation in life.

There are things she can help with. If you stick with that mindset of you're the only one who can do things you will have a rude awakening when you get out there in the real world.

There are many people better and smarter than you.

There will be a day when you are the deadweight.

This is a problem I deal with in managing people - this is the solution: [comparitive advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp)

I know I can do things better than a lot of people on my team. Probably about 20 out of 25 of them ... but, I don't have the time to do the work of a team of 25 software engineers - I need to delegate. So, comparative advantage is the solution.

How do you apply comparitive advantage in this situation? You need to look at her as a resource. What can she do that she won't screw up - and will save you time to focus on the harder stuff. She will contribute, you will save some time, you can do more important things.

Resources? That means people. People are a resource. You are a resource, she is a resource. Your time is a resource. Use your resources efficiently and to the maximum of their potential.

Last, and maybe the most important- let her know you are putting your trust in her to do her part. You're counting on her to contribute. As long as you both do your part, you both get that good grade.

Trust motivates. (Of course, trust but verify. Never trust blindly.)

Do it. You have no idea how valuable what you will learn is if you pull this off. This is leadership. This is infinitely valuable.

**TL;DR: Be a leader. Help a person. You both will win.**

I’m in the same situation. Poly addicted brother who won’t get medical help, rehab or counseling for his addiction and mental illness. Mother enables him and gets heartbroken every time she thinks he’s gonna change. Heck my sister is going through this very same thing with her son the last 3 years and she can only empathize with my mother (her step mother), though she is trying a different approach she’s still making mistakes. Her son stole and wrecked her car after letting him back in her home after having kicked him out nearly a year.

Your brother sucks obviously.

Your mother sucks because she is effecting your life with something you really don’t want to be a part of. She sucks for enabling him but in her shoes she’s really trying to help him. But it’s hard to help when she’s being manipulated. 

You suck for basically telling her to give up and get over it. You have kids. You might say you’d do better... 

Though in my family the fathers try as little to be involved as possible while the mothers really want to fix their children and have them at least safe and know where they are and if they’re okay. I’m not saying you’d be one of these fathers but please don’t be one of these fathers if this ever happens to your future adult kids. 

It’s fair that you want to live your own life free of this drama, you have every right to, but as long as your brother doesn’t get the help he needs, your mother will never stop being effected by it. When your kids grow up they dont stop being your kids. One of her kids is very sick and fucked up and suffering with medical problems (addiction is a medical problem). Shes allowed to get upset.

Secondly, they could overdraft the account easily and that will hit your husband. If they overdraft it the bank comes for him and not the family. The same applies to the credit card.

I understand his desire to help his family. But he is putting himself and you at a great risk since his family is not good with money.

I also don't think it would have gone over well to march up to her and say ""you're too much of a burden on me right now, let's stop hanging out"". Adults often phase each other out and scale back on social interactions without needing to make declarations about it.

“A landlord cannot enter the accommodation unannounced. He or she is obliged to first knock or ring the doorbell, and wait until the door is opened.
A landlord is not allowed to visit the tenant at any given time. When the landlord wants to visit the accommodation, he or she needs to have clear and well-formulated reasons to do so.” 
Technically, what the land lady did seems to have been a violation of the law. While her intent may have been great in her own mind, I can completely understand how what may seem sweet to her would have had you running for the hills. The landlady was not your mother and had no right (as far as I can tell-if I’m wrong please correct me) to be in that apartment without your knowledge.

I very much understand where your parents are coming from: they're scared. Coming out as trans inevitably means a swath of challenges for your family, and feeling apprehensive about the runoff of those challenges is normal. Maybe even expected.

What they are overlooking, though, is how difficult it is to be closeted. It's far worse when you're trans, as far as I understand, because (and correct me if I'm wrong, naturally) you're confronted every day by well-meaning people who are using a name and pronoun you don't want, and you are constantly reminded that you're not living as yourself. Your parents' role right now is to protect and support all three of their children, and ideally that would mean finding a way to work together as a family to support your decision to come out and prepare your brothers for what might happen.

Be aware, though, that coming out will present challenges for you, too. The school may not be supportive (I'm not sure how well-protected you are in your area, so I can't really say), and you will want to be very ready before you take any steps. Make sure you're safe."

But not in the way you think.

You should have stopped the destruction in the first place. Allowing your friends to vandalize makes you complicit of the act. Who your friends are reflects on you. They are shits, which means you are shit.

Do you know why the school ""forgave you?"" Because it would have looked horrible if their valedictorian didn't graduate. If you weren't their top student, you wouldn't have been given this chance.

The only reason you care about what happened is because you were about to lose your ""honor.""

Truth is the world may thing you have honor, but you don't. Not because you ratted your friends out, but because you stood by and watched and did nothing. You only did something when you were threatened.

Pure speculation here, just my thoughts -

1. Your bf might be burned out from serving and want downtime in the evening. Or if he works at night he can't socialize the same way as folks with a 9-5.

2. Your bf might be struggling with depression or anxiety and isolating himself.

3. You want to expand his social circle?  Wonderful intention, but you can't force a friendship. You can say, ""Let's hang out with x and y people for a movie or game night."" and see how it goes.  (Something close ended.)  

4.  If he's being clingy, I would want to know - he's being controlling? Is he preventing you from seeing other friends?  If so, please carefully evaluate if this is healthy.  

If he sees you as good company, okay, but lay some boundaries. Make sure you take time with your friends / family."

Bringing up your niece sounds a bit hollow -- were you and your wife setting aside any money for you niece? Saving to help with her college or emergency expenses? Unless you were contributing financially to her upbringing I don't think you get to judge how her parents handle it.

Of course, it would be nice of him to do, that doesn't mean he's obligated to.

From what I'm hearing it sounds as though you aren't able to live freely in your own home because of your dad's temper. Regardless of whether your father is to blame, this is an awful situation to be in. It makes a lot of sense to me that you'd feel angry about that.

Brain stuff is complicated. I know that a lot of people who have Traumatic Brain Injuries, for example, experience difficulty regulating their emotions. So it isn't totally surprising that someone who has part of their brain removed would find it tough to remain calm when things don't go exactly the way they are envisioning, and it isn't clear to what extent your dad has any control over that. At least in theory and depending on what else is going on, your dad should still be capable of apologizing and acknowledging that things got out of hand, but these things vary person to person.

You are NTA/NAH (depending) for being angry at your dad. He isn't able to be there for you in the way you need him to be, his illness takes up a lot of space in your life, and it sounds like you aren't getting the chance to just be a kid and make mistakes and have fun. That doesn't necessarily mean you should act on that anger -- like yelling at him or telling him all the things on your mind -- but it's always okay to feel what you feel.

You have no idea if you are getting an inheritance and want to borrow against it, while the giver is still living?

There are plenty of domestic violence agencies that would help your gf. She needs to reach out to social services and explain the situation. Services are not just financial but can help her get counseling, even if it's just a social worker to talk to. She might qualify for a relocation grant to help her move into an apartment, as a one time only gift.

I'm sure our intentions toward her are good, but I'd never advise someone escaping a domestic violence situation to immediately move in with their new relationship. She's young and needs to discover herself and develop some independence, and a caseworker will probably be able to counsel her on that."
e6cyf7,YTA. If she specifically asked for it wouldn’t she kinda already know what she was getting since she asked for it for Christmas?

Once you guys know whether you're going to keep seeing each other, you could tell him you started listening to that music because you saw that he was interested and it piqued your interest.

Companies who ask employees not to discuss compensation are the AH - they are actively trying to prevent employees from understanding the compensation structure. If they have valid reasons for you getting less than others, then they should be transparent enough to discuss that with you openly.

A fucking judge ruled you would be responsible for her death. You don’t care though; her life doesn’t mean much in comparison to the dogs. That much is clear. Not only that, but you’re forcing your S/O into a fucking hotel every other weekend (don’t even get me started on the financial aspect) and you’ve considered moving out before you’ve considered giving up the dogs, so I guess you don’t care about your relationship either. I feel sorry for your baby; god help them if you ever have to choose between them or the dogs.

Edit: didn’t know about the stepdaughter being hidden when this was first posted. That definitely makes this a far more sticky situation than it appeared at first. Undecided about whether or not the OP is actually the asshole.

Edit 2; I’m going to go with YTA still. Unexpected or not, step or otherwise, a kid is a kid is a kid. And that kid will be in your life forever, regardless of biological relation. If your biological kid were to develop an allergy, what would you do then? What if it was yourself? Your S/O? It’s unfortunate, truly, that you have to give this up your dogs for the child but that kids life should still mean more than whether or not you keep the dogs. At the very least, shop the dogs around. TRY to find them a good home. If you try and fail, that’s a different story but if you don’t try you are definitely the asshole."

First off, yes your hubsand is an asshole for blowing up at you. Thats a mountain out of mole hill reaction but lets deep dive into his thoughts. Way I see it couple things are going on, one or all could be true 1) He thinks women should only wear ""appropriate"" clothing outside. I agree thats a controlling dick move, assuming you don't live in a place where you get arrested or anything. 

2) he is legitimately afraid for you cause he believes men are monsters and if they look up and see your nether regions it may alert the monsters to your presence. This is kinda shitty to put the burden upon you but at the end of the day its the monsters he is afraid of

3) he asked you to do a thing and you just ignored it and never expressed why you felt that thing was a bad ask. This would upset anyone and doesn't matter what. If you asked me to refer to you as Karen and I refused and called you Melissa that would upset you/anyone. 

So to me the real issue is you relying on your **inner** feminist an dnot your **outer** feminist i.e. you and hubs should discuss what the actual issue is so y'all can atleast know what the issue is. I think if men vocalized their problems they would better be able to process them and see how silly they are. Cause if he thinks guys might get a quick lookise well...thats rather insane isn't it? But doubt he has ever faced the  reality of saying this fear outloud."

e6k8e7,"NTA. His comment at the end just shows how awful he is. If he asked you to venmo him for your ice cream, just ask him to venmo him for everything you bought for him."
e6k8is,[deleted]
e6k8zh,"NTA. Dude, you need to get out of there like yesterday for your own mental health. Do whatever it takes, you come first in your life."
e6kap9,NTA. Technically the books are NOT still hers. Hindsight's 20/20 but that doesn't mean her friend gets the books.
e6kcbt,"NTA.

You didn't say 'Hey Prof. Please fuck my friend over.' or mention anything about your friend at all actually. You asked for your test to be relooked at and then the teacher realised his mistake.

Fuck all to do with you."
e6kchp,"Considering you said you’re a woman and this is like your sister, NTA.

This is someone you were close to for a number of years and if your brother isn’t uncomfortable with you being friends then I don’t see why he can’t disconnect from the fact that they were together. She should just be considered your friend and not your bros ex at this point.

If you would buy any of your friends a plane ticket or lend any of your good friends money, then that’s who you are as a person. It shouldn’t matter what your brother thinks."
e6kdk2,"NTA. It sucks sometimes but you can’t let bad partners ruin your grade for you for the sake of appearing nice.  Your teacher told you to boot them too. As long as you handled it graciously, I think you are fine here."
e6kgwp,"YTA

If it’s so close drive yourself. The tip is for the convenience they offer you."
e6kha3,"NTA You are all taking the class and she's distracting you by making comments about how gross things are, thus making it her business. You brought it up as a joke, but were making a valid point. If you want to have a job in emergency medicine, you should be ok with the sight of blood."
e6khsm,NAH- you *should* be honest with your friend. If it’s been 2 years already and she still cries over it every day- she prob needs some sort of professional help- therapist maybe. Friends unloading on us can be draining- which is why a therapist would be great- she can unload on them and get some professional advice at the same time.
e6klgh,NTA. FIL needs to keep his opinions about your body to himself.
e6kn9n,"YTA only because he’s fucking one, of course things confuse him. How else do you learn besides exposure and practice of confusing shit? Children are sponges and the more you expose them to the more they take in. Worst case scenario he doesn’t pick up on please and thank you, best case he does there is no harm in trying."
e6kpyh,"NTA, she's not a child, old people don't suddenly loose all sense of right and wrong unless they are really ill. Start talking back or you are gonna be a rug, and same with her children. You don't have to just take it."
e6kui5,"YTA, this this no different than a noise complaint. Your recreational activities are disturbing your neighbors. They shouldn't have to breath your second hand smoke just because you don't want to leave the building to get your nicotine fix."
e6kujv,"NTA. Imagine being so selfish that you could still enjoy a trip *knowing your presence is a huge imposition.* 

Your husband needs to push back, tell her to change the ticket, and impress upon her that it is **not cool** to plan stuff like this without asking first."
e6kv8t,NTA- she sounds hella flakey.
e6kvfg,"Sorry, but I think YTA in general. You aren’t thinking of your child at all in this situation. Divorce is hard on them and it would be nice if you all could be cordial adults for a Christmas gathering. I would hope your girlfriend could understand that it is one day where you can show your kid that they are loved by their family and that everyone can get along."
e6kwnk,"NTA

I think you probably need to do this incrementally.

Take him aside and let him know he's violating the spirit of the group when he uses dead names and inquires about sexuality in a personal way outside of group.

Let him know these actions aren't appreciated and if he continues behaviors like this he won't be welcome back."
e6l1d5,"NTA. From each according to their ability, to each according to their need, comrade!"
e6l3cx,NTA- there’s this cool theft powder that turns purple when you touch it. It reacts to moisture if I remember correctly. I would dust the bag with that and catch them purple handed.
e6lb2o,"YTA. 
Why’d you take the job in the first place? They’re being friendly to you and you’re gonna walk out just because you don’t have anything to do? 
Why don’t you talk to your friendly boss and stop ignoring him. That’s no way to act in a professional setting. Especially if you are really considering quitting."
e6lcff,NTA at all. This is not up to your FIL and you’ve made a really fair request.
e6lee2,"NTA but if you want to avoid this I future, I would suggest each paying $10 a month or something though to cover shared expenses like dish soap, toothpaste, toilet paper etc. That way all those really basic things won’t become an issue when it comes to sharing. Your roomate is in the wrong here though and toothpaste or not, it’s not right to take your stuff without asking."
e6lktx,"NTA, but what would you do if they refuse? I would seriously think about finding a new roommate."
e6lm2h,"NTA

You have a lot going on and it is perfectly reasonable to stay home and relax. It's not like you're stopping him from going."
e6lo82,"NTA. It's great that your parents have done so much for her, more than a lot of people would, but ultimately she's not their responsibility. At 18 she's an adult and it's time she started to think about looking after herself. It sounds to me like they're good people and as such they deserve to enjoy their twilight years."
e6loav,NTA Never ever put a shit minimum wage job before spending time with family. This is why materialism causes so much suffering.
e6lqoi,"NAH - No one is an asshole here, but her logic doesn't make sense even if the portfolio doesn't get her a better job, it will certainly put her in a position where companies are more willing to take a chance on someone without the normal expected level of experience."
e6ls1d,NTA. I have the same experience with my family and they also use the same excuse when i use bible quote against them. I think making your mother cry is unfortunate but you were just standing up for your own conviction so it's not really your fault. Apologize for making her cry but don't apologize for standing up for yourself.
e6lury,"NTA

Going out to eat is for you to take some time away from your desk /work and literally take a break. When you are responsible for ordering food for them, it takes away from your break time and it makes you responsible for their food. 

I wouldn't mind doing it every once in a while, but not all the time."
e6lvbe,"Going against the grain here with NTA .  And here’s why. Your mother did nothing while your SD abused you for years. He pushed her 3 year old grand child, and she did nothing. So on the off chance she talks him into letting her spend time alone with you and your family, can you ever really trust her to protect your child in her care?

Until she can really talk this out with you and recognize the abuse she has enabled, she isn’t a safe person for your child to be around. Your mother needs a divorce and counseling, but the odds of this happening are slim. Perhaps your ultimatum will be a wake up call for her. But until she can truly break free, your priority needs to be your child, not her or your SD’s hurt feelings.

Edit: misspelled word"
e6m1mf,NTA - sometimes you grow up and grow apart. i don’t think you would be an asshole whether or not you sent her a happy bday message but she might appreciate the thought
e6m2fc,"YTA. He’ll probably just think it’s cool and edgy and the point will be lost, plus now he’s got another lighter."
e6m52j,"NTA 

You’re paying the bill aren’t you? If you pay the bill you get a say period. I’d move out tbh because that sounds ridiculous and controlling. 

I’m pretty sure if they can pay the extra oil bill they can pay someone to shovel their driveway too."
e6m5wq,"NTA-. Joining in on a protest about something that you aren't protesting would be a more asshole move.  

 If you wanted to go with them to show support I'd make it clear that you aren't against the decorations, but feel that everyone should be heard.  But either way, they ( the Jewish girls) have put you in a tough spot and singled you out."
e6m8jl,"*Whaaaa ?* Why would he want to get a vasectomy reversed if not to have more kids? The, ""I feel less masculine"" excuse doesn't fly and has no basis in fact.

e6mat7,"YWBTA 

Right motivation, wrong execution

You're really not in a position to do anything with that intervention but piss her off. You would need to get someone involved who has some professional ability to help her and authority to demand she accept the help or face the consequences.

Your heart is the right place but you really don't have anything to actually provide her with."
e6mb6q,"NTA

RED FLAG! Dating a month, asking you 5x a day to see you, showing up *uninvited* when you need to leave for work? 

Run! That is really overwhelming and definitely not something you should ignore. He is not listening to you, he is acting way too possessive.

Nothing about this seems ok. Listen to yourself and dump him."
e6mkn5,"NAH (Wife or sister, boyfriend=asshole)

Don't invite him, but be prepared for the fact your SIL probably won't attend. And from the sounds of it, she will involve as many people as possible."
e6mlxy,"NTA, this is so bizarre. 3.5 is WAY too old to be breastfeeding, and if it’s to the point where he’s pulling practical stranger’s shirts down, there needs to be an end."
e6mm2e,"NTA.  I finally started doing things as well to a friend. 
I put up my hand and say ‘hold on, I wasn’t done yet’. Kinda awkward but just remember, she deserves it. It’s beyond rude 
My favorite is if she does it on the phone. I just start saying ‘hello? Can you hear me?  Oh ok cause I was talking and thought maybe you couldn’t hear since you interrupted’ lol"
e6mr4i,"NAH - the idea that it’s rude to discuss salaries only benefits employers. 

Anyhow, it’s a valid question and he gave a valid answer. 

I’m a professional artist and as a community we often discuss how much we make off of a work or a show. It helps us know what’s “reasonable” for art prices, and know which clients will try to get work on the cheap."
e6msog,"NTA, not your dog, not your responsibility but it sounds like you’re trying but your dad isn’t backing you up. If you can’t take care of the dog and you’re it’s primary caregiver, talk to your mom about rehoming it or at least get your dad to take up some responsibility regarding his dog. Your list of chores sounds extensive, especially if your siblings aren’t pitching in. You’re the eldest, doesn’t mean you’re the maid. Your siblings are old enough to do some chores and help around the house."
e6muho,"YTA

Gift giving is not about expecting reciprocation. It is about showing how you feel about the other person.

Learn to accept gifts graciously and to show thanks. Do not deny the gift giver their opportunity to express their love for you.

Also, don't stress out about match gift financially. Give based on what you can do. Good people will appreciate it. What matters is that you thought of them and got them something."
e6mwxh,"NTA. Play bitch games win bitch prizes. Do it anonymously and leave it to the profs to decide if they can tell of they cheated. It's law school not highschool. Cheating has consequences. This happened all the time when I was in engineering school. People got reported and they deserved it. If you do cheat and aren't smart enough to make it look like you didn't then you doubly don't belong there.

Edit. There's a lot of ""you have the wrong motivations"" in these comments. Motivations be damned. This is a social lesson about giving people a reason to turn you in. A lot of cops will let you get away with speeding 5mph, but if you flipped them off when you passed them they wouldn't. Learn not to give people a reason..."
e6mz7v,"NAH. There’s different levels of kosher. Can he just order a vegetarian meal where you go? That’s usually kosher by default if you’re basic kosher like no meat and milk in the same meal. If he’s requiring a place keep a kosher kitchen then that’s kind of unreasonable. 

Also there’s no reason he can’t join you and drink seltzer and cranberry on Friday. Maybe ask him what he suggests? He hasn’t crossed the line into being an asshole. He’s been kosher for ages and knows that sometimes it limits your options like a vegan person would. If he hasn’t asked you to stop or god forbid accuse you of being anti Semitic, he can feel a little lonely without being an ass. Also most places will sit one extra person who brings a bag lunch if there’s a whole crew of people. If there’s at least 6 of you and one person says they can’t eat there but wants to join, the restaurant would be an ass for not allowing that, especially if they can’t accommodate that person’s dietary needs. It’s not like he’s going in alone wanting a table."
e6n4fb,"> because M really likes him

e6n4l9,"I'm going to say NAH - we don't know her situation, it might be that she is homeless and that is the safest place for her to sleep."
e6n6rb,"NTA. I agree with Dad. Why can't your mom or your sister's baby daddy be the chauffeur? You work and have classes, what makes them think you have all the time in the world to play limo driver? Kinda sounds like you got voluntold but didn't want to put up a stink about it so you just did it to make everyone happy."
e6n8ca,"> Maybe our mistake was in telling people our plans to elope.

Facepalm. Apparently you and I have VERY different dictionary definitions of the word ""elope"" because the fundamental key to it is the secrecy. NTA, but you kind of opened yourself up to criticism on this one."

Don’t share meds like that, you’re smart not to. Your mom should go to the doctor and get herself checked out and get meds prescribed by a doctor for HER."
e6neql,"You're asking a depressed person to be friends on your terms, by giving them tasks that not only seem impossible, but add to the overall stress of the illness. Do some research and maybe find out what your friend *actually* needs. I'd rather claw my face off than go out with friends during a depressive episode, but it's also very hard to say no to the invitation because you're afraid your friends will abandon you. Like you did.

Yeah. YTA."

Your roommate is upset because of the ongoing issues with your cleanliness. It's crazy that you said it would be a surprise to your roommate just to do some dishes. These are little things that you should be doing all the time to keep up with the house, doing dishes isn't some big event. Living in a home with your constant mess has got to be frustrating to her. 

Your solution of calling a cleaning company is a bit insulting. Like instead of just picking up after yourself a little bit you're calling some service to come by so that they can clean the place and you can go right back to fucking it up again. Your roommate just wants you to do your part, and that involves actually putting effort in rather than having someone else do it for you. 

The fact that you called a service shows your roommate that you're not willing to change your messy behavior and that is frustrating. She's been communicative with you, and if she plainly said she needs some space you should just respect that."
e6ngt1,NTA- 8k is nothing to lose compared to tying yourself to a house with someone who is clearly not ready to commit to you. Walk away girl!

If he finds out you're not married and he makes a thing of it, he's TA for sure. But he hasn't done that; you're only speculating. There's no need to worry yourself over shit that may never happen. 

Right now, it sounds like both of y'all are just living your lives. He may have been having a bad day that time his face fell when he saw you. Or he may have felt intimidated cuz he likes you. Either way NAH."

e6o4vc,NTA.  I also had an abusive father although not has severe as your situation. I have tried to bond with him and he doesn’t seem to care but loves my siblings. I’ve decided that if my siblings were to come to me if my dad was sick etc I’d say sorry to hear that and have them deal with it.

See, you were polite and direct. Autistic people like direct because we can't take a hint. It doesn't sound like he was upset by the situation at all.

You:

1. Were speeding and lost your license as a result of that. 

2. Caused your parents’ car to be impounded and *they* had to pay to get it back. 

3. Decided to ignore the terms of your suspension and drive anyway, which could get you thrown in jail. 

4. Bought a new car, when that money should have gone to your parents to cover the cost of your mistakes. 

5. Are driving with no insurance. 

6. Yelled at your parents who are rightfully concerned and angry about the entire situation. 

I’ve never seen a more clear YTA post here. You are acting incredibly irresponsibly. You were (still are) driving dangerously. You’re exposing your family to financial and legal risks. You’re 21 and old enough to know better. Grow up, stop breaking the law, pay your parents back, and stop being such an asshole."

e6rin9,NTA. But uhhhh... do you need a niece? I’m very friendly and communicative.
e6rj1w,"NTA.  She made out with your girlfriend and is pissed at you for talking about it?  If she wanted her private life to stay private, she should have kept it so.  I get that she might have been confused and being outed before she was ready was probably difficult, but that's not your fault.  

Did she ever even apologize to you for what she did?"
e6rkjt,NTA- I don't think I even would have went to see her... I had to re-read ot a few times because she sounds like she is trying to be your mother... Is she normally such a r/nicegirl?
e6rkuv,YTA you know that shit is probably illegal
e6rkwz,"My goodness, *major* NTA. Of course you weren't asking for advice when you were literally telling him good news."
e6rw3w,NTA. Your sister sounds ridiculously selfish and self-centered. Stop showing her things you want for yourself.
e6rx82,ESH. You were also disturbing the peace and possibly making patrons other than the parents and their children uncomfortable.
e6s03k,NTA but alert her bank and possibly the police to come have a chat with her about internet scams. And maybe let Grandpa know not to give her anymore money
e6s087,"NTA. Once a gift is given, the recipient gets to do whatever they want with it."
e6s2qx,ESH.  Your dad doesn't get out of helping pay for his kids because he makes less or spends so much on alcohol.  Your mom is spending her money on weed and alcohol instead of making sure her kids have what they need.  Perhaps the weed and alcohol explain why she's not working as many hours.
e6s5io,"NTA x 1000

It is NEVER their place to use food as punishment.  You should go to the media about this - this can never be allowed to happen to your son or another child again.  For all you know, this COULD be common practice, and this is simply the first time anyone found out about it.  

You know what kind of nonsense goes on in schools.  Give 'em hell!"
e6s7co,"NTA, as a musician I can tell you it’s common curtesy to either put in a mute or turn of electric instruments after 10.  Just because we’re nocturnal doesn’t mean we’re allowed to play if it means other people can’t sleep"
e6s7g1,"NAH, but I understand how someone not versed in medical lingo could be taken aback. The ""asshole"" here is the hospital, and I suggest bringing up the optics of how that particular diagnosis can come across when read aloud to patients. Perhaps there can be checks in place to describe the diagnosis differently or contextualize it. Anyway, you were just doing your job - it would in fact have been unprofessional and inappropriate to omit it and not do a standard discharge."
e6s9cl,"NTA, always rearrange on graph paper and cut out sections for furniture first do that all day then move the real stuff once. Or else you end up like this. I mean how many times did you guys have to rearrange it in 2 hours before he was still unhappy?"
e6sbtp,"NTA. Once a gift is given, that’s it. Your friend doesn’t get to come back and put conditions on the gift later on."
e6sc9s,"NAH. I have friends where joking hard with each other is the norm, and sometimes a joke can rub someone the wrong way without you knowing it until it is said. Y'all handled it like adults. Maybe just avoid that line of joking in the future."
e6sdgy,"NTA at all!!!
Your parents sound dreadful. If you don’t have a lot of experience telling them no, start by eliminating your excuses/explanations. It doesn’t matter if your car is in the shop. 
“Oh, I’m so sorry but I can’t”
“Oh no, I’m unavailable”
“I think you might want to look for another sitter” 

Repeat a million times, in a friendly voice. I’m only suggesting the friendly voice because it sounds like telling them no is new for you and sometimes it’s easier to ease in to it. Good luck!"
e6sik9,NAH your health is just as important as his. tell his landlord about the bedbugs and only go over to visit him in designated bed bug clothes. it's not his fault he has bedbugs tho.
e6sonw,"NTA - and it may be worth it to take her to court for everything. This would be a great episode of Judge Judy. 

Also I’d say it’s safe to say her friendship isn’t worth it."
e6spfz,"NTA.

She said you were making your wedding all about you? Umm, that's the point, that day is supposed to be all about your and your partner.

It sounds like even if you invite her, she probably won't be able to come, so I don't see the harm in sending her an invitation.  Purposefully excluding her would potentially shut the door on any future relationship with her, and who knows, down the road you may wish she was back in your life."
e6ssw0,"NTA

Bullying is fucking disgusting.

Im not saying you need to do this but I'd draw a hard line with the manager (if I could afford it), because I would not want to work in a place that tolerates that sort of attitude."
e6sv72, NTA - And I’d block him.
e6swse,"NTA: coming from someone who has a reaction to the point of breathing issues its up to you guys about getting the cat and not your father.

- little side note if its really a full blown concern just keep one room fully cat free (closed door) and keep an air purifier in there that way its ready at a moments notice

- honestly i can't visit family or friends too long that has a cat, 15min is the max before severe symptoms start to kick in. so i get your dad's side but ultimately its about your guy's happiness"
e6sxze,NTA - she was being racist. that sort of behavior deserves to be pointed out
e6sy6k,Looking for more people to tell you you’re a great friend?
e6t43g,"Easy ESH.  ""i will shove thats statement so far up your ass..."" doesn't make you sound tough in any way shape or form.  Your groupmate sucks, but your reaction was out of bounds and only really comes off as a pathetic empty threat from a fake internet tough guy."
e6t5y4," Nta at all. Cremate her. There is no reason her friends couldn't meet at a park or a restaurant and chat about the good times, but you don't have to shell out for someone who wasn't part of your life."
e6tbzz,"NTA - Everyone has to respect reasonable boundaries. 

I had an acquaintance (lol, referred to as Star as well, funnily enough) behave in a similar way. It became exhausting and I started to expect all my friends to be bringing up issues about her anytime I went anywhere - as thats what happened. 

Banning her is the only option, you have given her chances and she has been warned. She is continuing to behave this way even though she is informed of the consequences. 

Good luck to you, its rough on the guilt dealing with situations like this."
e6tfov,"NTA, I would listen to your parents if I were you. You're at a vulnerable age and could be exploited by this person. Wait until you've got on your feet as an adult and keep your guard up."
e6tjn4,"YTA. Part of being a functional adult is learning when to channel Elsa and let it go. I used to be that person, who always had to be right. It’s exhausting for everyone involved."
e6tmlk,NTA there's no reason to let that person stay with you. They're a stranger. Your son is being an entitled pos. He's not being logical.
e6tmlu,"YTA. 

Joking is fun, and everyone laughs.  Cruelty, on the other hand, is not fun.  Not everyone laughs, because one person feels singled out.  

Also, just because something is true doesn't make it ""OK"" to ""joke"" about.  

Now, if you didn't *intend* to make your sister feel bad, then you can go and apologize.  On the other hand, the way that I read this, you harbor more than a little resentment toward your sister for skating by and not paying her way, so this may have been a way of ""getting back at her""."
e6tn4g,NTA nobody can order you to spend time on a vacation. They should be glad you're going at all if you don't like the woman.
e6tn5f,"YTA. Dude, I come in contact with doctors pretty regularly. If you aren’t making those connections, you’re only going to hurt yourself. When this gets out (not if because this is the type of behavior that gossip lives for) all you’ll be doing is outing yourself as someone difficult to work with, and making your life 20 times harder. 

Have you passed this idea by meddit? How did they respond to it?

Edit: I see you got a mediocre Step 1 CK, and your step 2 was one point above failure. Maybe your bad test scores combined with a not great attitude is why you didn’t match a residency?"
e6toe1,"YTA

Lying to your friend saying its Thursday and its really due Monday is a not the right thing to do.

I would be pissed if I was your friend who worked on getting the project done all night for you to say ""It's actually due Monday.

Even if he doesn't do his part, that's on him not you.

Edit: a word"
e6tp2f,"NTA, but if it would take” hours” to move the trampoline wouldn’t it be worth that time?  Also, aren’t those kids a liability on your trampoline unsupervised?  Moving the item seems like a small price to pay for safety, comfort and peace of mind."
e6tsn2,"NAH. But they aren’t wrong. Don’t open something that isn’t addressed to you unless the recipient has asked you to or given permission. Kinda mail 101.

Edit: I see it was addressed to you. It’s still a kind of crap thing to do since you obviously knew it was something for them."
e6tsu1,"If you present your complaint to management in a logical manner, they may very well understand and possibly take action... Honestly I don’t think anyone’s being a straight up asshole in this situation, however they did unfairly give out the prize. If I was in your shoes i’d definitely feel frustrated as well.

NAH - There are no ill-intentions, just a poor management of the prize. This could end up being a great scenario if management listens to the complaint."
e6tvpp,NTA. What a bunch of dicks.
e6tzw7,NTA what kind of psycho keeps unopened gifts in a closet for 6 months
e6tzwu,"Bro, I’ve slept on those uncomfortable-ass hospital reclining contraptions as has every other red-blooded husband with a pregnant wife.  I can empathize with you on that.

Let’s recap your story:  You WOKE UP your exhausted, overdue wife and TOLD her you were going home to get some sleep b/c this was all just too much for YOU. 

Going home to sleep when you’re exhausted does not make you an asshole.  However, given the circumstances and how you went about doing that- 

100% YTA"
e6u28z,Jokes about rape and assault are not funny. I don't understand why you think he's not an asshole. He's a colossal asshole. You're NTA.
e6u2ts,"NTA

I am virtually never in our office, so any work function is always an imposition, so I never attend. It's unacceptable to demand that a staffer take unpaid time out of their workday for a social function.

That being said, not going is clearly sending a bad message to your employer. Inconvenient though it may be, you may want to attend for the sake of your career development. Conversely, if you can conveniently schedule client activities that prevent your attendance,  you can beg off gracefully."
e6u53w,"NTA - You’re never obligated to touch someone or let them touch you. It’s ALWAYS okay to say no to physical contact that makes you uncomfortable. All your life people will try to push your boundaries...learning how to say no politely and firmly is a skill, and people should always respect no. Anyone who pressures you when you say you’re not confortable, including your mother, is in the wrong."
e6u974,NTA she willingly loaned you said item. Didn't even give it to you properly packaged. You packaged as best you could to drive it home. There's NO WAY either of you could've predicted a car accident. She needs to get over it. Don't loan out anything you aren't willing to lose. Period. Definitely NTA.
e6uaph,Nta. You’re being completely reasonable. Enjoy your day off.
e6ub8w,LED nightlights work give plenty of light without being a sleeping distraction.
e6ue5d,"If you feel that negatively about someone that you needed to say that, then I don't think you should be (or are really) friends. Which is totally okay, hang out with people who bring out the best in you, not the worst."
e6uedi,"Ugh NTA. If she’s calling you a bitch for not sharing your answers with her, she’s not a good friend."
e6ufmj,"NTA. Strongly consider accepting the full ride. I know you want to get out of your bubble but if it’s a good school and you are getting a full ride, that’s truly an excellent opportunity and something you don’t want to waste. 

Take advantage of any scholarship opportunities that come your way."
e6uja0,"NTA at all for not wanting them in your bed. So freaking weird.

A little bit TA for using ""I's"" to indicate possession.  (Just a friendly tease from a grammar nerd!)"
e6ujns,"NTA. Your family sounds horrible; spend Christmas elsewhere. Alternatively, buy a guillotine for the gift exchange and announce that this year you’re dispensing with the bourgeoisie.

Double edit: The best part is, it's a gift for the whole family!  (~~Except~~ *Especially* you, OP.)"
e6ul58,"NAH. I really think you're taking this the wrong way. Your roommate clearly thinks highly enough of you that she wants you to be there for her graduation. That's a pretty big thing. It doesn't sound like she's pressuring you to go. It sounds to me like she was just trying to get you information on how long it would be so that you could see if you could fit it into your schedule. If you don't want to go, just tell her something came up during that time, but that you won't be able to attend. Maybe get her a graduation card for when she gets back from the ceremony and a little treat or gift."
e6unhc,You might want to take a big breather. PPD can really screw with your thinking and judgment. Don't do it.
e6uq38,I would say NAH Bc 1) the cat needs to be on a diet abd you’re roommate can’t have him eating your cats food but 2) restricting your cats movement also isn’t fair. I think you should explore other ways of feeding the cats such as feeding at specific times (where your cat would be locked in your room and his outside) or a food bowl that releases food when the cat wearing a special collar approaches so it can’t be activated by his cat. If you did that he should pay for the feeder since it’s his cats problem
e6utyl,"NAH dude. Labor is sometimes long and slow and surprisingly boring, and you're only human. You will have to keep laughing it off though, because you're never going to live this down. Take it on the chin."
e6uzaw,"Maybe she found it creepy. No one wants sex talk from an uncle!

YTA"
e6v29p,"NTA

Taking your possessions and forcing you to share them against your will is controlling behaviour."
e6v2gx,That doesn't make much sense. Those women would still be allowed in due to being with a man. Frankly lesbian/bi solo women or groups of lesbian/bi women only would be less likely to cause trouble.
e6v82l,"Good god, YTA and I am PRAYING this is a shitpost. 

If not, then I struggled with mental illness all throughout my teens (that’s what those are btw, mental illnesses, not disorders)—and still do—and you sound like you’re handling all of this *really* poorly. Can we be hard to be around? Yes. But guess what? Your son is more miserable than you because he’s the one who’s mentally ill, unable to properly regulate his emotions, all while being a kid. He is your responsibility and you need to help him.

Your post sounds deeply resentful, impatient, and more interested in containing your son than helping him. Get him a therapist, get your own therapist who can teach you how raise your son, and stop acting like he’s constantly scheming and out to get you ffs.

And, guess what? You worry he might have issues with consent? *Then talk to and teach your child why it matters.*"
e6v9cl,"NTA - Justin could have gone to the store for you, and he could have helped you sanitize the tank. If he had cared about what's important to you, he would have gotten what was important to him."
e6v9ii,"NAH. Needing some distance from constant negativity is understandable. Don't tell her she's toxic or affecting your energy negatively in those words though. Maybe say it in a softer way - you could try saying that it's overwhelming you and while you understand how tough it is for her, it's more than you can handle everyday."
e6vbmy,NTA Supporting homophobic organizations is validating their views.
e6vezi,"NTA. She sounds so petty, wtf."
e6vjw8,"NTA but... it sounds like you’ve tried to get her to hang out far too many times with the same response. 

Don’t try anymore. Put the ball in her court and see how long it takes her to contact you to hang out. It’ll be hard but if she’s a real friend, she’ll make contact and stick to plans. Don’t waste your time on someone who isn’t giving you any of hers."
e6vkdj,"NTA – congratulations, you are dating a selfish child"
e6vlwq,"NTA, but you weren't bullied.  You were pressured, and probably unintentionally.  There's a difference.

Tell Ryan it's out of your budget and ask for another suggestion."
e6voa8,"NAH. Set up a timeline that is reasonable for her and for you for her to pay you back. 

If she seems like she doesn’t want to then she’s the AH."
e6vpuh,NTA. Quite the contrary. You were friendly. She should be considerate of the public space.
e6vr6a,NTA.  The cross became a popular secular piece of jewelry decades ago.
e6vuby,"YTA because sometimes plans change and adulting involves understanding that work obligations sometimes take precedence in order to continue providing. 

I can't honestly connect your comments about his haircut to your comments about the cabin. You sound really passive aggressive and petulant. Go to the work event with him to show your support and be proud of his accomplishments. Then take him to the cabin to celebrate privately. 

As for the haircut, it's just hair. Bad cuts happen. Guess what? It won't last forever, but the way you treat him over all this will certainly leave a lasting impression."
e6vx0j,NTA. Calvin and Hobbes is totally age appropriate for your daughter. I would talk to your wife and ask how she finds it inappropriate and go from there. Good luck!!
e6vxh8,ESH - she’s a bad mom. That was a petty post. Maybe y’all need a custody agreement enforced by the court.
e6vy8d,"YTA, your mum is right, its not your place. Why do you have to post all about it on fb? Sounds like you just want attention and to stir some shit up. Doing it literally benefits you in zero ways and just hurts people."
e6w076,Yes you’re the asshole. You can’t be kind to someone for the expectation that they will fuck you. You’re basically exploiting them for sex at this point.
e6w86u,Absolutely not. And you should tell them that when you do quit. NTA
e6watg,"NTA, but I'd just be honest. If they're so set on having expensive stag and hen dos, they need to be prepared that some people can't afford it. There's no shame in that. If they're angry people can't come, they're just being bride/groomzillas because, honestly, who puts the destination above being able to have fun with your friends?"
e6wbpc,"NTA- your mother's sperm donor effectively abandoned you. You owe him nothing as a father, because he effectively wasn't one. As you said, you feel bad as a person, so you aren't a monster. But you owe him nothing"
e6wcdq,"Tell them they have to also bring salads potato,  pasta,  and regular. 

Or tell everyone it's 25 or 30 bucks minimum spend and they have to confirm their choices with you first so you can ensure everyone's pitching in and covered fairly.

OR no one can only bring drinks everyone must bring food and one drink or one salad. Also to let you know which it is so you can be sure there's enough food and drink lol"
e6wfqo,"NTA at all, first off if he wants to hold you the standard of a ""real"" babysitter, charge $20 an hour, $30 for between 8pm-8am. Probably more for twins. Then he can have price of the book back, for repairs. Like i cannot stress enough that $40 for babysitting two days is nothing.  
But all pettiness aside, you did them a favor. He's T A if he thinks you owe him something."
e6wnmo,NAH - It's like idiots that leave their towels on gym equipment to claim it as their own. And then trot off to the other side of the gym to do something else for half an hour. You were there for a full hour before he got back!
e6woqu,"The whole text exchange makes me feel like I’m reading a soap opera, holy shit. 

Anyways, NTA. She honestly sounds crazy and frankly I wouldn’t want to associate myself with someone like her. You communicated your feelings to her in a respectful manner and it’s sincerely her problem that she’s not taking it well."
e6worj,NTA - i‘m sure there are other people who could help here and even if not she knew you were already late and i hate when family does this thing that only they are important.it‘s just petty and immature
e6wpi4,"NTA - what sort of company asks the staff to pay bonuses. Bonuses come from the company's profits, not from other staff."
e6wpqb,NAH. What you described is typical teenager angst. You think your family and the world doesn't understand you. I have been there myself. It's the chemicals in your body going a bit crazy. Don't worry. It's normal. Hang in there.
e6wrfk,"NTA

I'm just getting a kick out of this. I truly enjoy how much consideration you have put into something so small - it's a good thing!

I don't know how old you are, but mature people aren't going to stop being your friend over this if they are actually a friend. Just let your friend know your reasons and offer to share his playlist with him so he doesn't lose it if he makes his own account."
e6wwc7,"NTA. Believe it or not, women can move out of the way too! Whenever I'm walking next to someone (I'm a 5'3'' female) and I see someone coming up on me, I drop back to walk behind the person I was walking next to until we pass the person. It's called being a considerate person. If someone chooses to take up a ton of room on the sidewalk and not move out of the way when another person is approaching, they deserve to get bumped into."
e6wzl9,"ESH. It's not your place to demand they divorce, but it's 100% your place to refuse to subject your children to it. Maybe only allow them visits individually and supervised, then see if they can keep their complaints about the other to themselves?"
e6x392,"NTA - people who are your friend under the expectation that you will give them things arent really your friends. If that's the case, then you can find better friends. On the other hand, it could be that he misunderstood your refusal as you not trusting him, in which case NAH and maybe try talking to him about it again?

Also, for the sake of clarity, I think you meant lend, not borrow. It's a common mistake, but the person giving is the lender and the person receiving is the borrower. I knew what you meant immediately because I know plenty of people who speak english as a second language and they do the same thing."
e6x4sr,"YTA, cat pics are the best. Nah jk, but instead of calling her out in a bad mood you could've just said it politely. Ya know just like 'hey thanks for sending me the pics but I'm not that much of an animal person and don't really want them, no offense.'"
e6x6qe,NTA. It's your home. You get to decide who comes around or not. Just be prepared to see less of BIL for a while.
e6xham,[deleted]
e6xkjg,"NTA ... 

Though I would be moving out asap and considering this might end whatever relationship you do have w/ your father."
e6xm8t,"NTA 

She should have never talked to you.  It’s none of her business."
e6xndm,NTA if you poke fun at someone's obvious trauma what do you expect to happen
e6xs9h,"NTA and frankly, your boyfriend's being a bit of an ass if he doesn't even bother to like stand up for you."
e6xtym,"NTA your bf is gonna have to learn about women sometime. I walk around in my underwear all the time. Period or no. Thankfully my bf doesn’t make me feel bad about my period. When I’ve leaked through during the night a couple times, he’s been totally kind about it. During the day I obviously make sure to change my protection frequently, and like you I wear a tampon as well as a pad. Your bf is being immature and rude"
e6xuo1,"NTA. It will probably upset your dad, but you're not obligated to keep something just to make him happy. If it comes up, which it probably will, be honest with him. That's really all you can do. He dictates his own reaction from there and you're really not responsible for that."
e6y3h3,"NTA wanting to have the celebration at your house. 

But, you could always let your brother-in-law and sister-in-law decide since it’s their problem if their kids get upset? I don’t mean that to sound harsh. You’re trying to do something nice for them! But if they don’t really have a problem driving the extra 30 minutes then there is no problem.

Your father-in-law may be a little over the top here, and if you’d like to have the holidays at your house next year maybe start planting that seed early this year. It shouldn’t really matter where you are as long as you’re together. 

People get really funny (read: crazy) at Christmas time. It’s actually the most stressful thing about the holiday in my family. Everyone deciding who’s going where and when... and if you can’t make it to someone’s house they get offended. There’s only so many hours in a day and as time goes on and families grow bigger there’s more and more places to go. 

I’ve stepped back from going to a lot of gatherings. No regrets!"
e6y8a4,NAH but go over there with a plate of cookies and explain in a friendly way that their bright light is flooding your home at night and that you’re wondering if they could adjust it so it points more into their own yard. Letters can very easily come off as hostile.
e6yc0c,NTA. And I really strongly dislike your mother on your behalf.
e6yi2x,"NAH. There are no tickets purchased and you’re not leaving him in a lurch. Take the trip that *you* want. It’s your time, money, and holiday experience (and if you don’t really want to be there your lack of enthusiasm may dampen his enjoyment). 

Happy holidays and safe travels to wherever your final destination."
e6yomm,"NTA he was either trying to shame you, or being Pervy (or both). Neither of those things is okay in any setting. Report him."
e6ypvb,"If you don't like the scent that much, you have two options:
1) Gift her a nice perfume, saying it's a token of gratitude for taking care of your child. Or just as Christmas present;
2) Find another nanny.

Dictating her how to manage her life and what kind of perfume to use ain't one of them, imho.

BTW, NAH."
e6yqs4,"ESH. He definitely isn't acting in a way that you would expect your friends to act. I don't blame you for questioning your friendship with him. 

However, you waited until the day before the concert to decide that you no longer want to go with him. That leaves him very little time to find alternative plans."
e6yud3,YTA. You gossiped about him behind his back.
e6yvo9,"NTA but frankly this feels like a humble brag. Yeah, you’re doing the right thing but you already know that"
e6yvyt,"NTA. If he's just a FWB then it shouldn't matter that they cannot meet your kids. It's your choice, not theirs"
e6yz0g,You are NTA to calmly and accurately inform a business of bad customer service.  You always have that right.
e6yz54,"ESH  
\-your brother: his marriage ceremony was so expensive, that everyone, including your parents who he probably knew didn't have money, had to chip in  
\-your parents: they obviously do not know how to handle money. since you said they had options, could have saved up, if not for themselves, for their children. they bought gifts when your father lost his job, which is hella irresponsible  


\-you: living rent free, going to dubai, having money for going out, and still asking them for money when you know they can't afford.  


\-you sister: she good tho  


Seems like all of you had options to save money and not be in this situation. I don't think it's too late to start saving, things can always be better. You know - you live, you learn."
e6z3r3,NTA obviously. But shitty company rules. Such a waste of food.
e6z7yr,"YTA.  I think you are crossing the line from ""concerned parent who wants to be involved in their child's education"" to ""that control freak who never shuts up at the PTA meetings"" stereotype.   If you think your child's project was offensive, then you can discuss it with them/correct them at home.  

Also I don't think your concern about them thinking slavery/civil rights movement is all there is to african american culture is valid - especially with young children, it's only natural to focus on the big historical things, and the rest will be filled in as they progress through school.  You can't condense an entire culture completely/accurately into one project."
e6zh9l,"NTA, I lived with my boyfriend throughout college like this but I only did it with pre-approval from his roommates. (My parents are ""traditional"" and wouldn't let me sign a lease with my boyfriend). I also contributed to the bills of that house. You however didn't sign up for this. She is free to bring her boyfriend over and spend the night, but he can't live there without your permission. Are you renting? Most leases say you can't have a visitor for longer than 2 weeks so maybe you can look into that and bring it up with her. Otherwise I would ask her if she can designate only 3 nights a week with him there or something. You deserve to have that space the way you want just as much as her."
e6ziqr,"NTA

Your roommate promised things that weren't hers and felt it would be just fine to take what she wanted without asking.

If she doesn't apologize, it's time for a new roommate."
e6ziu1,"NTA

This is the future she chose with her actions. She needs to learn to live with the consequences.

Going forward, your kids will be splitting holidays between parents. That's just how it is. She has no one to blame but herself.

Stick to your plan."
e6zrfs,"NTA it is sometimes easier to test the reaction of strangers, so we can gain strength to tell the others in our life"
e6zt41,"NAH. It bothers me that your concerned with rent instead of rehab but I can't call you an asshole for it if he agreed to pay half in 1st place. 

In situations like this, I always wonder did you move in a partner or did you want a roommate to help with bills?"
e6zxd4,"NTA at all. Your request of a non-band/gaming related shirt 5 days a year is *totally* reasonable. Hell not even that, you sound like you're even fine with certain video game shirts on those days.

I'm normally very sympathetic to the ""you're not going to change me"" argument but it just doesn't apply here. As a spouse you are allowed to make reasonable requests."

If C needed you in by a certain time, they should have told you sooner, that way you could adjust your plans accordingly. Overall, C was pretty rude about the whole thing and I think it could have been handled better."
e6zzqf,NAH - but I think you are a kind person for worrying about this.
e700zg,"NTA for not donating, but you might want to take your own advice about going somewhere else if you're that salty about your current compensation.  (And if your reaction is ""it's not that simple,"" maybe think about why the cleaning staff might feel the same way.)"
e701ip,NTA- You should’ve cut them out sooner. That’s definitely an invasion of privacy.
e704pz,"NAH - you should be able to joke about whatever you want.  Just know that when you joke about things that are very spiritual and important to certain people, you may very easily end up offending them. Know who your audience is when you make jokes about things like religion. And if you do offend someone when you did not want to, and you feel bad for it, its very simple to say that it wasn't your intention and that you're sorry for having offended. Normally that can smooth things over on all sides"

> When I turned 16 my mom gave me a car

She gave you a car. Meaning she purchased it, fronting you the money.

You are entitled to nothing, really. Her giving you the $500 is more than what you deserve (you think you deserve money for maintaining your vehicle that you drive...) 

> I felt robbed because I did nothing wrong and just got screwed over by being in the wrong place at the wrong time yet I have to make due on my own

Welcome to life, kid."
e70a7p,"NTA. Under the circumstances, this is probably the only way you'll get out the door. You said she studied psychology?"
e70c8m,"NAH. 

They probably wouldn't be reacting like this if you hadn't corrected them pretentiously in the past. It's annoying to have someone correct you sanctimoniously about the pronunciation of a word. 

""Wonder-waffle"" is funny. And you are playing a game, not presenting to the UN. Who cares how ""accurate"" their verbiage is? 

YWlightlyTA in the past, and their present reaction is predicated upon that built-up irritation. Just drop it and let it pass."
e70fiy,"NTA, sounds like she's taking advantage of you for cheap labor.  You shouldn't go back, tell to watch YouTube and finish the work herself or hire someone else."
e70gft,"This is a bad-faith argument. In the US, it is commonly understood that food delivery is similar to waiting tables, where wages are low and are assumed to be supplemented by customer tips. You can dislike tip culture but feeling that way doesn't make it any less real. 

If you want a tip-free pizza delivery, order some frozen pizzas online and smugly accept your package from the postman without a tip."

""No,"" is a complete response. Biology does not give him the right to demand this of you. He may have fathered you, but he is not your dad."

It's an easy mistake to make and it's an easy mistake to correct too. No dramas. Not sure what your friends' problem with it is."
e716ww,"YTA in this specific instance - you can suck up your own preferences for one day so that she has a place to study. She's probably upset that you're not willing to give on this when it really matters for her, not that you have your own preferences in general.

EDIT: Doubly so because, by your own admission, there is literally no other place she can study. Letting someone in that situation study at my place even though I prefer to study alone is a solid I'd do for a *friend*, nevermind someone I'm *dating*."
e719i4,"YTA -- Please, do NOT bring your healthy baby to feed at the funeral for your friend's baby. 

Don't spend the whole day there. 

Go and have your husband bring her and just say you're going out for air and feed her in the car. 

Don't spend the whole day there."
e71b3w,NTA. She's TA. Stop hanging out with her.
e71bo7,"NTA you are not his father; it's not your job to be a parent to him. Do what you have to and protect your mental health. The best thing you can do is get your own shit together & be a role model. The man needs to own his shit, & seek help for his issues like an adult."
e71efc,You aren’t TA so much as you have a problem that you need medical and psychological help for and I can also understand why your mom would be stressed and upset about that.
e71gzj,"NTA - You cant agree to a deal then decide 5 months later that it doesn't make sense.

If he had come back after an hour or a day then I would be more inclined to suggest having that discussion, but 5 months is way past the figurative 'return' date."
e71h54,Are you cancelling because she won't leave for the night? It seems like YTA here for asking her to move in and then asking her to leave for a night as if she doesn't share the place with you. This is equally her space and you can just be considerate of the fact and maybe be the grown adults you and your friends are and behave as such.
e71ic4,"YTA, of course.  Why would you even imagine it's acceptable to do this?

>Not that this is relevant, but this place just opened up and put another brewery out of business that didn't serve food, and encouraged bringing outside food

If the old brewery had encouraged you to throw the pint glasses on the floor when you needed a refill would you have done that at this new place?  Of course not.  What the old brewery did/allowed doesn't mean anything.  They're two separate businesses and the manager should have tossed you out."
e71k42,"NTA

You are adults with children of your own. You have every right to live independently and raise your children as you see it. It sounds like you have a plan to make that work financially, so start executing it."
e71kat,"ESH.

He should have communicated with you and recognized you can't physically sit in the waiting room. I don't blame you for leaving, but it would be the humane thing to call around and see if anyone else can fill in."
e71lmj,"NTA. I know this will get downvoted into oblivion, but your sister already had her PPD (pretty princess day). I understand and totally get vow renewals, but they are not second weddings. Personally, I think wearing a wedding dress to a vow renewal is gauche because you already had your day and now it looks like you just want that attention again. There are plenty of gorgeous dresses out there specifically for vow renewals. Had it been her wedding, I would have voted differently because I think in that case, you should have run it by her before you bought it since you both liked it. But she's mad at you for wanting a taste when she's looking to take two bites out of the apple."

I'm prepared to be down-voted, because this sub seems to hate it when you call the person who was an AH in response to an AH an AH.

The manager is OBVIOUSLY TA, and he was TA first. However, in your account, you say you left your aisles in a condition that is ""borderline unsafe,"" and that you shouldn't have taken it as far as you did. That's what AHs do. I do understand your reaction, but that doesn't change the facts of it.

What you could have done is asked AH Manager for an example of shelves stocked to his liking, and just done your job. You like how big mart did things better. I think I would too. But now you work for small mart. You can do things in their messier way, without setting up unsafe conditions (and without setting the scene for non-injurious disasters), but you chose to go full AH. Just own it. We're all AH once in a while."
