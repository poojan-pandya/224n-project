9m1gfn,"NTA. That being said, I think that there are ways that you can still hang out with your friends without making her feel ousted. I’d talk to your friends seriously about it and explain how you feel before getting upset. "
9m1ihv,NTA while your motives are far from pure ultimately if they break the law the consequences are on them. 
9m1w76,"You were the asshole here, but I don't think you're actually an asshole just need some experience.  Lots of girls will dump you.  It always hurts.  You'll dump lots of girls and feel ok about it even if you know they are hurting.  Such is life."
9m2m9k,"One person in the street isn't a protest, in my opinion.  It's just a raving loon.  I don't think you'll have to tell anyone- I think she'll feel plenty in danger in the middle of the street once morning traffic starts, and move.  You can't block 3 cars at once, as one person.  And sure as shit if somebody just gets out of their car and starts coming towards you, other cars are going to pass anyway.

She's more a danger to herself than anyone else."
9m31uc,"I'd say it's borderline asshole behaviour. You can always excuse yourself from the room, but restricting what and who they're allowed to talk about isn't gonna make you any friends. The ex seems to be a part of their group. They're exes for a reason. You shouldn't feel threatened by the mention of her name."
9m3aat,"Not the asshole.  The living room is clearly designated as a play area for your daughter, and a communal zone.   She has her own bedroom.  But more importantly, she's a grown up, and as such she's perfectly capable of taking care of her own needs.  Your daughter's a baby, and she needs to have room to play and explore.  You can't expect a baby to be considerate of a full grown woman's needs, and you can't expect a mother to prioritize the needs of a grown, capable woman, over her own infant."
9m3y37,"Your first reply sounds like you're jokingly or half-jokingly implying he might have murdered the drunk driver. Seems to be well taken.

Your second comment sounds like you're trying to forget the mental image of the drunk driver's death. Fairly innocuous.

Your third comment (the downvoted one) sounds like you are being dismissive and passing judgment. ""Okay then"" is something that may be said dismissively and the brevity of your comment enforces this interpretation. It doesn't make much sense to hope one ""gets better"" from losing a loved one. At worst, the idea that one coping with a loss should ""get better"" could be taken as flippant or patronizing. The more likely interpretation is that you are judging him for his vengeful mentality (his mental state needs to ""get better). While there might be an argument that there's something unhealthy or ugly about deriving satisfaction from the drunk driver's death, consider that the man is coping with a great loss. Even if you still judge him for his way of thinking, it's in poor taste to do so out loud without an enormous amount of tact (and maybe even then.) You're the asshole, albeit perhaps unintentionally."
9m5mry,NTA. You simply spoke up against a borderline abusive husband and shit parent. You don't have to do anything he says and you shouldn't feel bad  for going against him.
9m6l5u,"The answer is no, you are not the asshole. Your wife's emotional wellbeing is important, but so is yours. She needs to work on why she feels abandoned. It's not like you're canceling plans and actively ignoring her to play PUBG. "
9m77e0,If you want unlimited get your own phone plan. She’s the one paying for it so you have nothing to complain about. It’s not a huge problem. 
9m7ct7,"Not at all the asshole at all.  Church should be a place you feel welcome and loved, and most importantly, it should be a place where you can worship God in a way you feel comfortable.  

A lot of people are very uptight about their denomination, and it sounds to me like your parents are having very hard time with the thought of you ""leaving"" the church.  One thing you could do is invite them to join you once to see what it's like.  Of all the denominations that accept LGBTQ people you could have chosen, you chose one that's probably the most similar to Catholicism, and they might not know that.  Maybe give them the benefit of the doubt and show them what it's really like.  

Personally, I think you should do it anyways, though.  Your parents will either come around it it or they won't, and their ultimate reaction will show you a lot about how open they are to people who don't fit into their ""perfect Catholic"" worldview. "
9m7v21,"Yeah, you're the asshole. For sure. What did you have to prove to a man with, literally, nothing left but his favorite sports team. You sir, are a fuxking asshole"

So I have this friend and he's dating this girl. Now this girl and I are like best friends, we talk a lot, and she confides in me pretty frequently. Well the guy recently told her that it kinda bothered him how much we talked because it made him feel like a bad boyfriend or something. Am I the asshole? Because I kinda feel bad.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
9m9bqy,"Nope. NTA. It is your hair, your body, your choice. Her preference is just that: her preference. "
9m9rhe,"You’re not an asshole. But I understand her- sometimes because of my severe depression, things that are pretty basic to others become difficult. But instead of reminding me or asking me about it, my boyfriend just helps me. We do things like clean my house together when it becomes more than just “cluttered”. Or we’ll even shower together to get my brain more willing. By not asking or reminding me, he’s silently saying “you’re an adult and you need to be responsible” while also supporting me through action. Maybe she would benefit from the same type of support? 

Either way, make sure you’re also keeping yourself mentally healthy, too!!! Good luck :) "

9mcpx8,"No, you aren't the asshole.   


I get that autistic people have a hard time of it sometimes, and that noises get made. But at the same time, her sister could have asked her to calm her self, or help her be quieter. Being autistic isn't an ""all behavior is ok"" pass. And it just gives people the wrong idea about the rest of us.   


I sympathise with the girl, certainly. But in a wider environment, the attempt should be made to not disturb everyone else as much as possible. "
9mcq4d,"And what would be the end game for your phone call? She gets kicked out of school, ends up working a minimum wage job and can't support her children thus becoming an even bigger burden to her parents? He loses his job and livelihood? I by no means condone what they're doing but if they're bad people they'll get caught out eventually without your help. 

Bad karma awaits you if you fuck with people's lives. "
9mcvw3,Yeah you're an asshole. Not caring about what people think of you is fine but purposely being rude and obtuse in situations where it's socially unacceptable and then blaming the other person for reacting appropriately to an asshole being an asshole is well you get the picture. 
9mczgz,Yikes. That relationship is going to bring you nothing but heartache and pain 
9me6vt,As long as you ask him politely you're not an asshole
9mfbzr,Nope. You are not required to stay with someone who makes you feel worth less than you actually are. 
9mfca2,"NTA!!  I'm an RA in my dorm building and I wish we had scanner access on our elevator (old building with old systems). Strange people in our building is scary, there have been too many incidents in the past on other campuses that make me extremely wary of anyone in my dorms that shouldn't be there. I wish you were one of my residents, I appreciate you."
9mfdhu,The second one was free so he doesn’t have a claim to it. I see where he’s coming from though but you have the fake so this is just how you made it worth your while
9mfk58,"NTA. She needs a change of behavior, and it's clearly her fault that the perfume went missing. I don't like to say this often about people because they have their reasons, but your sister really does overreact to little things."

9mhgit,"Both are kinda assholes and kind of not assholes.

"
9mi6oy,"Not an asshole for using the music, but your attitude is def shitty and you may just be a general asshole. Just because a musician is paid once to write/record music doesnt mean it just becomes free later. Studio musicians and composers deserve to be paid for their work. If you are using their work outside of the game they have been paid for, you should probably pay to use them. If you just listen to them then whatever, but if you do anything commericial with them then pay. "
9mimt2,"This sounds like it’s letting you know to never discuss finances or loan money within this family. 

You wouldn’t be an ass hole to ask, but don’t expect things to go well. This sounds like a situation that you should just learn from and move on. 

Edit- you used the word demand. You would be the asshole if you demanded money. "

Well, bless your heart.  Kids tend to be a bit expensive. Don't want you paying child support for your kids and being counter productive and all."
9mlpcz,You’re both assholes. They should have talked to you but in their eyes you just said they’re worse friends than your other one.

9mqyjm,"NTA. Who the fuck tells you they’re busy watching Netflix when asking about your father after he overdosed and is in the hospital?

9munz5,"You are breaking your lease agreement and putting ALL of the housemates at risk of the landlord evicting you guys. So yes, you are kind of the asshole in this situation for putting everyone at risk.

Edit: Did you tell Karen that your BF was living in the house or did you just say your boyfriend is also there alot?

Edit 2: OP, you are a massive asshole to put everyone's living arrangements and rental history in jeopardy because you and your bf are too selfish to get your own place and would rather pay half of 1 persons utilitys/rent each"
9muvqu,"NTA. You have every right to be angry.

Outing someone against their will is fucked up, regardless of intention.

That being said, I wouldn't be too harsh on him, as I agree he probably didn't do it to hurt you. "
9mv6rc,"NTA. You told your friend repeatedly that you don't want to play the game, and that you wouldn't play it. Furthermore, you even gave the game a fair chance. He shouldn't get mad at you for ""getting him into a story"" that he can easily play again. "
9mvi48,"NTA. But check up on the guy, depression is rough. "
9mvjh7,"NTA.

9mvkia,"WHY did you tell her that? Seriously. 

NTA, per se, but an idiot move."
9mw228,No as far as I am concerned you’re a minor hero for taking it into your hands. Drunk driving is nothing to take lightly
9mwuww,"Not the asshole.  

Listen, I'm the first to wave my pom-poms at someone actually enforcing their boundaries.  But I have to wonder:  why are you still talking to her *at all*?  What are you getting out of this relationship? If you feel she's being abusive of you -- cut her off permanently.   And if you think she's really a danger to others, go ahead and call the FBI tip line and tell them you are worried about her.  "
9mxpfc,"Lol her friend is being weird and dramatic. Some people do think the world stops when they get pregnant though. It’s funny, because if you think about how many births have taken place throughout history, it’s almost the least special thing ever."
9mya95,He is not entitled to your money. In my opinion you are not the asshole
9mzji7,"Definitely not the asshole.  My guess is that she didn’t want to put a label on things so that she could keep looking, but wanted you there as a fallback emotionally/sexually.  Cutting the cord was the right move, and the only way to escape the emotional chaos you’re feeling."
9n0mpx,"She sounds quite hormonal and emotional, she could be feeling hormotional due to PMT. IS she like this generally or only around her menses? You're NTA anyway but she may just need a cuddle and some comfort."
9n0oht,"I'd say YTA. He clearly has a strained relationship with his mom and brought up issues when telling his mom about past girlfriends so it sounds like hes basing this decision on history and experience. Id trust that he knows how to properly navigate the relationship with his mom

"
9n0pm9,You should not have shouted and yelled. But she did deserve it. NTA but try and control your rage in professional situations. 
9n0txa,"Not really an asshole to not be friends with someone. It just depends on how you choose to not be freinds with them that would determine if you are a asshole or not.

Are they a package deal? Doing everything together.. you meantion molly doesnt like to do what you like but miley does... does molly tag along when you both do your thing? If not just only do things you and Miley like and molly will phase out. 

If you completely ignore molly and act like a jerk towards her you will probably strain and/or lose your friendship with Miley too. Its a delicate balance act. "
9n18je,"NTA you dont have to be friends with someone just because they are not well liked. You tolerated his abuse for years and finally stood up for yourself. 

You didn't cause him harm or bully him just simply stopped interacting with him. "
9n1ig6,"NTA Not at all. Sort of takes the honor out of doing something when you constantly expect special treatment because of it, right? This is a passive way of saying ""give me a deal because I served the country, I'm special"" and honestly I wouldn't acknowledge he ever said it if you choose to sell him the item. "
9n1lya,Thats not a healthy partnership friend. 
9n1r31,"NTA You're allowed to have hobbies in a relationship, and as long as they arent morally questionable I feel like he should respect that. I'm sure theres things that he does that you put up with, he should grant you the same courtesy.  

Do have a talk with him though, so he knows what to expect moving forward. IE if you want him at the races, or see if he wants to jog with you, or at the very least to tell him when the races will be. Comm is key."
9n296w,Take time off of from this relationship to get yourself in order and do not do anything to make them break up.
9n2fso,"Definitely the asshole. 

Sure, the other guy should have driven in the slower lane but you don’t know why he was there and your little road rage hissy fit did nothing except endanger both of you. 

Two wrongs don’t make a right. It’s old, but it works. "
9n2kry,"NTA. I don't think anyone's ever an asshole for leaving an organization (of any kind) with which they do not align with core values/beliefs. It's better for everyone if they just leave, and you're fully within your rights to be outspoken about the problems that pushed you to make your decision.

However, if you feel that there is no fruit to be found in putting up public statements, don't. Personally, I have deep religious convictions but don't publicly go on about them unless directly asked, and even then, I avoid doing it online. Social media is a poor platform for emotional speeches. "
9n2l4d,"Nta not sure why you would think your an asshole for this. my advice is to approach your husband from the point of saving the dust covers to keep them nice, get a storage tub to store them in."
9n2pll,[deleted]
9n2rvb,"Everyone here is an asshole.  You shouldn't pass if there's a curve ahead, and instead of speeding up and cutting off the other asshole who was trying to stop you from passing, you should have slowed down and gotten back behind him until the oncoming traffic was past. 

But goddamn kudos on that, gif, very informative.   "
9n3dqb,"Yes you are. It is completely reasonable to say no visits after bed time however, you can’t demand that someone buy you diapers and come basically babysit when you want them to. You decided to have a baby, they did not, they have no financial or sitting responsibilities unless they want to. Get over yourself. "
9n40p1,"Yes.
Spanking does nothing to help a child. Plenty of studies prove that.
You wouldn’t hit an adult for stealing. You wouldn’t hit a child. Spanking an eighth grader is ridiculous. 


The methods they have now aren’t working but suggesting that the parents resort to physical violence is unacceptable 

As for punishments: grounding may not be enough. Taking away electronics and other privileges. Maybe taking her to a therapist or other professional is necessary because this isn’t normal behavior.

Spanking a child like this will lead to nothing good"
9n43xt,"NTA. You should have been upfront with Jane, or just refused to pick up Bobby. But Jane is the asshole and so is Anne!"
9n4fl2,"Yes - you are the asshole. 

Alright, now you might not be an asshole in other aspects but as someone who doesn't smoke, and gets insanely terrible headaches around people who *do* smoke, I have a special hatred for people who do it in public. 

And you, are doing it near a park. 

Near people's houses. 

Hopefully not near kids but the family oriented part of your post worries me. 

It's one thing to smoke outside but in an isolated area, but it doesn't sound like you are based on your description. 

Honestly, this is a huge personal hatred for me and I hate it way more than people even smoking regular cigs in public and I always think it's super inconsiderate of people to do. Again, I am super biased because I actually get super bad headaches from being around any and all weed but still, don't be smoking in public places and right in front of people's houses. If you're old enough to buy, you're old enough to understand that you need to be considerate. 

 




"
9n4rbv,"YTA. Have you heard about media representation? It is a very large deal to people who arent straight white males. When people see themselves represented in media it helps form a sense of belonging and strengthens their identity. Thats why teen stories are well recieved, because teens and people who remember their teens are able to  relate and feel validated by the experience. Gays have not been accepted in many circles, it is certainly better than it was even in the early 2000s but there is still a long way to go. It has only been a few years since gay marriage was legalized in the united states. So a story that shows an innocent romance between two young boys and doesnt revolve around the ""drama"" of if gays fit into society, is a novel concept. And one that young and old homosexuals (Or anyone whos ever had a crush!) will be able to experience and identify with. Im curious how old you are because I think you could benefit from seeing things outside of your own perspective. "

9n560e,Your not a asshole your just young and dumb. That communication shit only works with parents who aren’t strict. Strict parents will take that as an attack on them and that you don’t respect them enough to blindly listen to their rules.

9n696x,"Imo no, since it wasn’t a joke and you just didn’t realize in the moment that it lined up like that. It was unintentioned (albeit pretty funny if you ask me), and any ‘shunning’ is rather excessive. "
9n6or7,Nta but stop leaving your stuff out idiot
9n7z8r,I don’t want to come across as mean but I feel like you just have a ‘I have kids and it’s your problem attitude’. If I lived in your apartments I would be complaining too unless I saw you genuinely trying to control the noise but from everything I’ve read you seem to be like too bad so sad. Just remember other people live there too and even if it’s not quiet hours people still want a bit of peace and quiet in their own homes. 
9n95iu,Let his tears feed your satsifaction
9na0cu,"A little bit, yes. For a few reasons.

1) Bringing your girlfriend to class after you turned her down could easily be seen as you rubbing it in her face. I'm not sure how you ""rejected"" her, but this really wasn't necessary, and is a tiny bit of an asshole move.

2) She gave a valid reason for not continuing to help you. Some girls get incredibly jealous when they find out that their partner is spending time with someone who is interested in them. Some don't. But she doesn't want to be a part of that, and that's reasonable. And if it's just an excuse because she liked you and you turned her down? That's still a valid reason.

3) She's under no obligation to help you in the first place. She was being kind, and maybe doing it because she was interested, maybe not, but she took a risk, and things got awkward, she has the right to say no. There's nothing wrong with asking for help, but getting mad when they say no *is* kinda asshole-ish. Move on, ask someone else.

That said, what you do from here is what defines whether you're really an asshole or not. Continuing to be upset about it places you right in asshole territory. Realizing that she's not there to help you get a good grade, respecting her choice to not help you, and moving on? That takes you out of asshole territory and puts you back in the decent guy category.

It's your choice - do you *want* to be the asshole?"
9na1lq,"Just ignore them, the other dude's being an asshole. That's the kind of fuckhead who tries to block you when you pass him on the highway. "
9naoqc,NTA. People drift for multiple reasons. Dont fake a friendship with someone you kinda cant stand.
9nbzu6,"Ok...based strictly on what happened I think the professor is a sassy asshole. However, there's something about the way this is written, especially the diagram and the multiple references to the girl's weight, which makes me suspect that OP is a giant asshole. Perhaps everyone is an asshole."
9ncq28,Pretty sure Anna had a friend text you to gauge your interest in her. It backfired because their method was unbelievably stupid.
9ndjn9,are you trying to talk with a bot 
9ndzj8,You're not an asshole just explain that to her and tell her you'll make it up to her after midterms are over

9nejdp,"I don’t think you’re the asshole here. In my eyes it seems like you both had different expectations, and then when you (hopefully) nicely told her your feelings and she reacted in a pretty assholish way. But it looks like you’re good on this one."
9nfb03,NTA. You did the right thing. Is there a county school board or other governing body to which you could report your colleagues' behavior?
9nficc,NTA!  Sounds like you’re dating an asshole.  I wouldn’t have much trust in him ever doing the right thing after that...
9nfjq0,"NTA. 

She was pregnant, so hormones probably played a very big role in her emotions and treatment of you before and after the abortion. She's probably still unstable. 


The decision to have the abortion was ultimately her choice, and probably due to her instincts telling her she's not ready. You don't have to take responsibility for her actions, but it's good you care. A lot of men would consider it ""not their problem or their business"", which is untrue. 


"
9nfjqn, NTA it won’t kill the dog so no harm no foul
9ngidz,"She was playing you, damn. 

Edit: I had more to say. No I don't think you're the asshole. Just like you said. You are an adult and make decisions, just like her. If she decided to try and do that then that's her fault. "
9nh51m,Honesty often not appreciated and also not a bona fide offer so no need to answer truthfully and risk offending bunny lovers
9nhp4q,"You're weren't an asshole, you were polite.  Statistically, someone is more likely to be straight than not.  ""Significant other"" covers all couples regardless of sexuality and marital status, so I think it's a good move in general."
9nhs78,"""That's not my problem."" was not a good response and obviously ticked him off. You should've just told him that you already lended him a car and that he has to solve that himself since he asked so ungreatfully. You were a bit of a dick, but he was ultimately the asshole."
9ni0bs,Your not the asshole for trying to help someone
9ni0vr,Yta but only to yourself don't sit waiting hoping she might maybe hook up with you when there are other girls who will
9njlgq,If it was me I'd want to know.
9nlf65,Sounds like your sisters the asshole.
9nlh04,"You aren't the asshole for feeling those feelings. You might be if you act on them.

The fact that your mom waited until you were an adult for a few years speaks to her restraint. It seems as though she is being thoughtful in how she presents the information to you. It is also critical for survivors of abuse to be able to be their true selves to those who love them. Despite the fact that she's a victim, she likely feels 'dirty' because of what happened to her. Accepting her, 'dirt' and all, is important to her.

The parent-child relationship is very complex and it isn't as simple as 'they are the ones who look out for you.'  As they age, YOU will be the one to look out for them, actually. Having lost two parents to Alzheimers, I can tell you how true that is. 

This is one of those moments when being a grown-up is a lot less fun than it seemed when we were kids.  Your mom knows you well and she can probably tell that her revelations are making you uncomfortable.  I would suggest that you initiate a conversation with your mom about this topic. You can express much of what you've said here. Tell her that you know its important she be heard and that the abuse wasn't her fault. Tell her that it is difficult for you to process because the mother-child relationship is such a unique one. (I would leave off the bit about her role is ""supposed to be"" to protect you from the realities of life, however. Because as you left childhood, those roles began to shift. You'll be made aware of this more and more as time marches on.)"
9nlqhx,"NTA. If he’s driving under influence, you might be saving someone’s life by ending this now. "
9nnu6q,"NTA, but if she was otherwise kind and you don’t want to burn a bridge, it wouldn’t hurt to send a “It’ll make more sense going forward to direct your questions to XYZ, as I’m no longer with the company.” -style text. But you’re not obligated. "

Asshole.

EDIT:

This sounds threatening as all hell.  Why would you put a timeline on it instead of just asking them nicely if they could keep it down a bit?"
9nolxx,"yes, asshole. there's no point. heterosexuals haven't been oppressed in any way. "
9npf42,"NTA. I would want to know if my bf was sleeping around. I think what you did was very gutsy, and if she reacted that way it's only because she's trying to distance herself from the entire situation. Maybe she's embarrassed. You didn't know, and it seems like your intentions were honest, so no worries."
9npzk3,"Yes.  You’re the asshole.  You know your training is far more sophisticated than he can be yet you proceed to do it anyway.  I suspect you’re as high on yourself as you accuse him of being and let your testosterone get the best of you.

 The number one rule of being a fighter is knowing when to fight. You failed this time."
9nqg42,Nope and they make good blotters in a pinch if you’re shiny! 
9nqp13,"NTA and follow your grandma's lead - He fucked over his one and only positive thing by calling you names & threatening to destroy your property, you don't owe him anything, not even ""Happy Birthday"" but his ass  owes you a sincere apology which you are  probably never going to get. So enjoy being stress free and having peace.  "
9nrvu3,No.  Your mom is very busy and having a hard time prioritizing your needs.  It happens.  She will get over it. 
9ntpyh,If she forces you to make that choice then choosing your friends is the right move. NTA
9nu2ca,People like your SIL are the same people who let their kids die over their belief not to give them access to all that modern medicine has to offer. NTA your inlaws sound kinda toxic 
9nu6qa,"Of course you're not, she is, what kind of person does that, and why?
Unless there is something missing, this is a weird story, her motivation is unclear..."
9nutu7,"This is a tough one. On one hand his boss needs to be held responsible for his actions. On the other hand, your bf might be feeling really violated and stressed about this whole thing and might not respond well to an ultimatum.

NTA but you shouldn’t push him he needs to take his time to confront his boss"

9nvold,"I think OP was saying FIL & BIL wanted to borrow the car for 19 hr drive (one way) to winterize the property FIL bought, not winterizing the car.

And Nooooooo, OP, YNTA in this instance. While in-laws should help one another when things come up, it's not your position to loan a car that you or wifey may need and especially not when they have working vehicles (albeit somewhat older) that they can take up there and rack up the mileage on. "
9nvr9a,"Sounds like you want him to take care of you, but not have joined assets/any benefit for him. YTA. Have a mature conversation about your finances and goals. He’s offering to start putting cash away for a home, dude. "
9nw3qk,"Sounds like you were both assholes. Him for elbowing you but you for knocking his arm off at a point where that didn't really seem necessary, and being very hostile with your choice of words."
9nwnmp,"She chose when the end the relationship but that doesn't mean she gets to choose when you should be okay with that.   

Not the asshole. "
9nx5hi,You could have been more polite *and* more assertive but I don't think you're the asshole here
9nx6fc,I don't think any one is the A. I think this could have been avoided with better communication on both parts. She could have said when she planning to get there sooner. You could have asked sooner. Learn the lesson from this one. 
9nxa5l,"NTA as long as you approached them respectfully about it. 

You’ve brought it up, and now if they don’t change and you think it’s against your area’s rules/laws/codes, time to report him."
9nxbou,"I think YTA but so is your grandpa (and he’s more of an asshole than you it seems). If we lash out at someone in anger and insult them, it’s an asshole move even if your anger is legitimate."
9nxh1f,"NTA  due to being with toxic uncompromising abusive person that put you in messed up situations due to you compromising / giving in. If you're not friends now - consider it a blessing to be away from her because  you pretty much listed why she was a shitty friend despite you telling her ""No"" and ""Don't want to"".  "
9nxi4l,NTA - the store should know if someone is annoying customers in their parking lot. Feel bad for the guy but the store and its customers deserve to have a good shopping experience too.
9nxlo9,"You are not the asshole at all!  I honestly believe that you should get out of that situation and file for divorce.  His priorities are out of line and you compromised/were willing to help his situation out.   You should just file for divorce, make sure to he has no access to any of your finances, etc.   This is toxic and you should not put up for it.  The man you see today is no longer your husband if he cheats, does drugs often, etc.  You are not breaking your promise because he broke is.   Focus on yourself and not him.

Edit: I hope all things end up well for you and you deserve none of this.  "
9nxmk4,"Sexual harassment is sexual harassment, no matter the genders of those involved, and it is your obligation to defend yourself.  You were morally correct and not the asshole; but whether you were within the boundaries of the law is another question. You may want to contact a lawyer if he indicates he might pursue legal action."
9nxn27,Not at all; you made it clear to him that you weren’t hanging out to hook up that night. Screw him
9ny31f,"You probably shouldn't have said ""yeah, probably because of you"", but you're NTA for mocking her. If she's that sensitive to suicide, she shouldn't bully her peers. "
9ny4oj,"No. It's our actions, not our feelings, that determine weather we're assholes."
9ny98u,"I’m not sure I agree with the opinions that you’re an asshole, and those opinions make me wonder how old those posters are. If they have no history, she doesn’t seem interested in him, and he didn’t make a move for YEARS, how are you an asshole for that? 

He’s your friend and maybe it would have been easiest to not sleep with her, but I don’t think you were wrong to. The idea that a guy who has no chance with a girl can call dibs on her and keep her off-limits to his friends is possessive and weird. Not the asshole."
9nyou1,"I would absolutely tell her in case of an emergency, she can at least expect you to check in every few days "
9nyq8d,"Kinda.  Yes.

You don't have to like her. Enjoy her. Or approve.
But to keep your children from functions. Damages their relationship with family.
But also yours.

I get it. You really don't approve.

But you need to get over it.

And if you don't. 
Well, you are the person who made that choice. Not your brothers actions."
9nyr96,I dont think you're the asshole
9nyt0f,"No, I think that’s a normal conversation topic between women. She obviously was extremely sensitive about the subject, but that is not your fault and she shouldn’t have taken it out on you. 

If anything, it was just a lesson to remind you to be careful when talking with people in the workplace. I don’t ever ask questions like that with people I work with. I used to when I was younger, but now really I don’t even care so don’t even ask even to make conversation."
9nzjzz,You are not the asshole in my opinion. If she wanted to post her child's entire life online she should've used an account that family and friends couldn't see. If I were you I would respectfully ask her to remove the posts. 
9nzmte,[deleted]
9nzqb1,Raise your kids how you want to. It's best to teach them languages when their young. I don't think Gramps should have much of a say in the matter.
9o03qc,"Yes, absolutely. You're both assholes. Driving is not the time to be escalating situations like this. "
9o0dm8,"Not the asshole.  The party is for the kid, not for their grandparents.  You have no obligation to have a second party or to limit your father's involvement with your children because of her hang ups."
9o0t3g,"You're the asshole. Your girlfriend was always bisexual, you just didn't know it. Nothing has changed except in your head. If you trusted her to be faithful to you before she came out, you should continue to trust her. 

That said, I know this stuff doesn't always follow rational processes. You should talk to her about this. Not in the context of ""I'm thinking about breaking up with you"", obvs, but tell her what's bothering you, including the fact that you're bothered that it bothers you. She might be able to alleviate some of your worries. "
9o10y2,I should do that. I've poured thousands into this car over the years and he clearly thinks it's still his. If he predicated his gift giving on the fact that he could just seize it at any minute I would have just handed it back. I'm a grown man and I don't live in his house anymore.
9o14fd,"Of course not. He gave it to you, as a gift. It's now yours. He's the asshole for taking it back."
9o1cwi,"I've been there and it sucks. Trapped between the need to contribute fairly and feeling unable to move on financially. My father intentionally charged me so much because he wanted to make it harder for me to move out, so when he asked me to contribute to additional things like holidays it was more about keeping me trapped as a live in carer/babysitter. It was the motive that hurt me.

It just resulted in me becoming bitter and realising that he didn't contribute anything positive to my life. I don't think I'll ever be able to recover that relationship fully.

Now you have your own space/home I'd have a real conversation about it. I'd tell them how you felt and see what response you get."
9o1d0v,"Did you sneak out or did you advise the bride and groom you were leaving?

Money is always wasted when it comes to food for weddings - as your table was empty, there were clearly cancellations and no-shows, and that happens (I myself had a small wedding and even with 10% of the guest list not appearing there was a noticeably empty table which only bothered me once the wedding was over and I realised that this included close relatives who RSVP’d and didn’t bother letting us know they couldn’t make it. In my case, it was the lack of notice and apology that bothered me, as we paid per person and the money could have gone elsewhere, but nothing can be done about it now.)

The bride would probably appreciate an apology, as you did RSVP instead of saying, “sorry we can’t, it’s our anniversary” so she expected you to stay for the duration.

Also; usually the bride and groom are occupied with so much in the first half of the wedding that it’s not until the evening that they can speak to all their guests. The time between the ceremony and evening reception are filled with photo ops and wedding coordinators double checking everything is okay, bathroom breaks etc."
9o22ju,You're not the asshole here 
9o25lr,"Not an asshole.    
You have to look after yourself.   

You don't need to feel bad because she had no other friends- she brought it on herself. Sooner or later she will examine her own life and figure it out."
9o2klz,Yes. Revenge is never a stop on the high road. Don't walk the low road. It's low. 
9o2t97,"NTA, the fact that you're even concerned that you might not have given someone money backs that up. 

The POS (point of sale) at my work doesnt allow tips from customers so I might be mistaken, but any POS worth using in a retail environment would allow the employee to modify payment (this can sometimes be used to rip off customers or the restaurant), but I dont imagine editing a tip into your order is problematic, and some places might not even process tips immediately."
9o3f5d,"I have a friend who has suffered for YEARS from a single concussion. 

Your GF was trying to protect you; if you were hit again, even a small hit could be amplified from the previous one. 

It’s fine for you to be mad...but neither of you are assholes. Your brain is the very center of who you are and she clearly cares about you to risk your anger of it means protecting you."
9o4i1z,"Absolutely not. It's your house, you decide when visitors come over. "
9o4n02,"NTA. I, too, completely cut ties from my family 2+yeaes ago and have never been happier.

 Just because you're related to someone, doesn't mean you are obligated to love/ like/ tolerate their shit. Don't feel guilty for putting yourself first. You only get one life, don't spend it surrounded by people who make life unbearable. Congratulations OP! Go live life on your own terms! "
9o4nes,"Not the asshole, he could have used his card if he was so concerned about it being easy. "
9o4rcb,"You are not TA. Irrespective to this situation, your ""friend"" is a huge asshole."
9o59kh,"NTA, sounds like she couldn’t give you a straight answer and you had the hard read on her. Sucks if she actually was raped and was too nervous to say so at first, but even then you’re just preserving a relationship she already didn’t respect enough to not cheat before so"
9o5sgu,"NTA.
The mother got so mad at you because I bet she is sick and tired of her kid acting like this 24/7 so she just lashed out at you. You were polite and she went full psycho for no reason."

9o6g1y,"Nah your bf was in the wrong here. Forcing you to play his game isn’t fair and if his ego is that sensitive then i can only imagine how that manifested in other incidents.

Not the asshole."
9o6gh6,"Yes, you're very obviously a pompous asshole."
9o6jvc,"You're not an asshole, but remember the employees asking you for donations have to because it's part of their job. Pretty much everywhere you go is going to ask you to donate nowadays, and I agree it is frustrating. You're not an asshole for being frustrated, but if you let that frustration come out towards the people asking, it would be asshole behavior."
9o6s99,"Yes, you're the asshole for trying to disrupt other people's relationships because you're jealous. "
9o74d5,"From your own writing it seems clear that you want her to message you because you are insecure about the relationship, not because you are worried about her getting home safely. If you are pretending that safety is the reason for the request, that is exactly the kind of thing that will feel clingy, stiffling, and untrusting to her. 

If you want the relationship to have a chance, you are going to have to take a chance and act is if you trust her even if you have doubts. Because anything else will poison everything. Is the ex a concern? Maybe, and you can talk to her directly about that, but don't hover around asking for reassurance in the guise of safety check-ins."
9o7ajz,"Yes, common curtesy says you stop playing instruments after 10pm. Maybe later if it’s the weekend. Your especially an asshole for continuing to do it after they told you it was disturbing him. A restful sleep is more important than you playing an instrument.


Edit. Perhaps you could try looking up how to soundproof your apartment if you want to continue and not be an asshole."
9o7isu,"They’re an asshole, but they’re also trying to get a rise out of you.

If you react, you’re giving them what they want, and they’ll feel like you’re an easy target."
9o7lwz,"No, you're not the asshole. She's definitely being an asshole for leading this guy on and then acting like he's a creep.

He may actually be a creep, but she's initiating interaction."
9o7uaa,YTA. You made a list of girls. Girls are not objects.
9o81rm,"I think you are correct. It is about respecting you as an adult. While she is trying to help and definitely not a bad person for doing so, that doesn't mean she has a right to do that without asking first. "
9o8qt9,"YTA. You put your friends in a position where they were legitimately concerned for your safety and they acted responsibly on your behalf like a good friend should.

You not using the taxi does not take away from the fact that your state at the time and the concern for your safety were the only reasons why it was called.

The alternative is your friends just say ""Fuck it. You shouldn't have gotten so drunk! Not my problem"".
If something then happened to you, how do you think they'd feel for not trying to help you get home safely?

Pay for the taxi and thank your friends for doing such a great job of trying to look out for you."
9o8udn,Not the asshole at all but your girlfriend sure is. You’re putting others in front of yourself even though you’re in a bad situation. That’s a very selfless and considerate thing to do. Your relatives have good intentions too. It sounds like your family is filled with good people. 
9o8yle,"Not the asshole for asking.  It never hurts to ask.  Your dad sounds like an asshole, though.  Even my parents help me and my sister out in any way they can, and they make less than 100k between the two of them."
9o947z,">	Apparently my ex thought saying someone died was equivalent to him breaking up with me.

Wat?"
9o98h4,NTA. Illegal and unsafe shit like that kills people.
9o9h2y,"Yeeeaaah I think you're the asshole. Was it right for her to blow you off? Not necessarily-- but you also don't know why she had to leave so quickly. It also wasn't very kind of her to say that you're not great at tutoring physics, however, making claims about her intelligence when all you knew was that she was struggling with that particular class is rude. The fact that you didn't try to apologize after she made it aware how much you hurt her is also sort of icing on the cake. I'm not saying she wasn't being an asshole as well, but your choice of words and lack of apology makes you the bigger asshole."
9o9l1m,"As a female, I’ve always questioned why guys ask for a number and then never reach out. It’s kinda pointless and annoying. However, I feel I would be more annoyed for a guy to text me just to say they weren’t interested. I don’t think you’re an asshole for exchanging numbers and not texting her. She’ll probably be annoyed for a day and then move on. My advice is don’t text her if you’re not interested. 

Also, I wouldn’t categorize this as ghosting. Ghosting means you’ve been texting and then all of a sudden you don’t reach out or respond to her again. "
9oa02l,You know you're not the asshole. 
9oa0kd,"There's really not enough information here to fully figure out who was being rude.

But my guess is that you were there at a wedding -- a happy occasion -- and you were bringing up some ugly news to the mother of the groom about a close relative.

You aren't wrong for not liking a guy who bullied you.   You aren't wrong for telling her this information.  But dear God, time and place, dude.  Time and place.  Why would you bring this up at her son's wedding, right when she was feeling so surrounded by family and love?
"
9oabio,Absolutely NTA. Smoke weed errday and smoke weed all day are VERY much not the same thing. If you're not about that you can peace out and no one can blame you for that.
9oadm0,"Not the asshole.   Patty's a nut and a poor hostess.  You don't treat adult guests like naughty children and you don't insult them just because they said a word you don't like.  Your friend is a poor host for ratting you out.

I'd decline any further invitations to socialize with Tony at his house."
9oaxqf,"What would you do if a female friend/sister/cousin came up to you and said her boyfriend had hit her and sexually assaulted her? Would you tell her to stay and see what happens? Or would you do everything in your power to get her away from the situation?

Violence can't be justified away. Violence and sexual assault is something you need to get away from.

Dont stay in this relationship. "
9oblx9,"Eh, this is an incredibly difficult situation. Seems like you might have acted like an asshole when you talked to her about it, and you know it. But on the other hand, she's really digging a hole for herself going on about something like that to people she doesn't know well, and someone needed to say something. I've known people like that, and they make everybody around them uncomfortable and not want to be friends with them.

You seem like you know you could have handled it better. But she's got problems and there's no easy way to go about fixing them."
9obptu,"You aren’t the asshole for rejecting him. You probably shouldn’t have said you were thinking about it if you weren’t, but people make mistakes sometimes.

C is right, E is a toxic asshole that is using manipulative behavior and you absolutely shouldn’t date him. He will continue that abusive behavior in the relationship and trap you with guilt. The next time he threatens suicide you can call the police to do a wellness check and they will go to his house and check on him.

Pro tip: never date someone that threatens to kill themself because you deny them or break up with them. Textbook abuser behavior."
9oczd2,"NTA. You even offered to give the guy your number for help if anything is needed. He's the asshole, not you."
9od403,"NTA. You were required to be there and you were there. In a sense, what better way to honor the school than studying?"
9od49o,"Yeah I'm gonna go w asshole on this one, if only bc your friends have made clear to you that they are uncomfortable w this behavior, and instead of considering that they might have something valid to say about you polluting your shared space w your farts, you ""find is absolutely hilarious.""

Excuse yourself to the bathroom or outside to let em rip. That's just polite."

9odhtk,"Any time you say something mildly critical of this decade's socially protected class, you're going to get shit on.
 
Sounds like this person needs to become a little more assertive. I don't mean that in any sort of malicious way, just that people will do to you what you let them.
 
You are not the asshole."
9oef7j,Maybe it's how it's presented rather than your intent. Do you do this for every little thing? It'd be tiresome to feel like I couldn't tell my SO a single thing and have them accept it.
9oexj7,"Not an asshole, sounds like he was just a disgruntled customer giving you a hard time for no reason. "
9ofvl3,"NTA. While he had good intentions, he crossed his boundaries since it was a private moment and you were caught completely off guard. You have every right to be pissed, especially if he refused to remove it. 
"
9og8gv,"He's a grown ass man. He should be able to get up himself. If it was once a month, yea I get it, everyone over sleeps sometimes. But on a daily basis no."
9ognxx,Not the asshole. Tipping is a sensitive issue but at its core it’s compensation for good service. If you don’t feel you got good service then you have a right to not tip. It sucks for the server but that’s just the cost of doing business. 
9ogoyc,You’re the asshole. Nothing would have changed had they both waited in line. It’s not like 4 adults cuts in front of you and increased your wait time. 
9oh4ai,"NTA. Just have to be aware that she might already be teased and that your corny joke may be taken as blatant disrespect to her.

9ohey3,"No, you’re not an asshole for not wanting to join the military. People who serve take an oath to protect and defend the constitution. Would love to see where it says conscription for all, all the time. We haven’t had a draft since the war in Vietnam and I doubt the US will ever have another draft.  "
9ohmm1,Not the asshole. Especially not if you bought it. It’s your room and your stuff and she should respect that. 
9ohu85,"You are not the asshole, y'all both compromised. It would not be fair for you to have to give up so much without receiving anything in return.  You are both young adults now and she has to realize that she can't get everything her way.  It is not like you went to bed extremely late at night.  She could have gotten a sleep mask.  Roommates should always compromise somewhere in the middle and you were definitely not the asshole!  I know from experience(im only a year older than you)"
9ohwrn,"you are 100% NTA!!! i recommend you call CPS and explain about the drugs and stuff and say that you would be willing to foster or adopt peep as you already have a relationship with them due to being with the mother for some time. 

edit: spelling "
9oi2ug,Youre the asshole. Don’t even know why you would think that’s something a good friend would do. If you want to share your religion with your friend you need to discuss it with him directly. Not have some strangers arbitrarily arrange a meet and greet on their own schedule.

9ojzi5,"NTA. You would be held responsible for a kid who's parents aren't there, you can't expect everyone to be so comfortable with that.

"
9ok39j,"You are a huge asshole. Most people deserve the courtesy of at least knowing why you are choosing not to be friends, or at least get a good bye. It's psychologically messed up to keep people you once cared about wondering what happened for forever. Maybe work on your communication skills and remind yourself that people are not disposable straws that you just throw away when you've ""had enough""."

9onio6,"NTA

I'm sure there are thousands of very similar stories out there from other parents, and heaps of information to learn from them. Since he is 18 he is going to be around for ever, but unless he can treat you in a way that is  commensurable for how adults should treat each other then you are not in for a good time with him in your lives at any age. What he needs you probably can't give him. He is going to have to take it from you willingly. 

Being naive is your biggest threat in the future. He is manipulative and he will weasel resources from you when he is on his own. The reality of the situation is harsh, but the truth is that you can't go on sacrificing your own happiness for the rest of your life for someone ungrateful, it will only make you resentful and bitter, and having a future planned around being resentful and bitter is not going to end well. 

It's impossible to give accurate advice, but I would plan with my SO how much you are going to let him into your lives going forward, and explain that to your remaining children age appropriately. Kick him out. Help him with an apartment if you can, but don't co-sign anything. Change the locks. And most difficultly, stop giving him hand-outs. It's swim or die, and your life-line has unbending conditions."
9oo3jh,"Not an asshole at all. Save yourself. 

I was in a somewhat similar situation with an unhinged mother. My therapist at the time told me a lesson that he learned as a  lifeguard(though I'd assume every emergency responder gets one way or another).


It starts with you being in the ocean nobody around but you and the drowning person. They are kicking and flailing in a blind panic. You want to help you want to save them. However you know that they will pull you under with them if you try. The person has a choice they can try to calm down and let you help or they can continue and drown. Sometimes they aren't capable of helping themselves, and if so you have to stay away to save yourself."
9op5gj,"Not the asshole. Uh... so let's get this straight. Your boyfriend cheated on you and then publicly made fun of your upset reaction? You are still dating this douche for \[insert reason here\] reason. I wouldn't even assume that his absences late at night for a non-existent friend had to do with Abby. Where was he if he was gone that often late at night but apparently wasn't cheating on you? Emotional cheating is also very real, which he obviously already did.

Please have an acceptable reason, although I'm really not sure what that would be."
9opt8e,"Are you an asshole for asking who you’re speaking to? Nope. 

Are you an asshole? Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup."

9oqndc,"Damn, it's totally your roommate's fault that she wanted to fuck your brother but didn't want to fuck you. Oh wait, she did nothing wrong. Asshole."
9oqydk,"You are an asshole if your clinginess is keeping her from living her own life the way she wants.  It really isn't healthy to be completely fixated on one person.  By all mean still treasure your friends and hang out with her often, but take a evening or afternoon off as well and try to talk to some new people as well."
9or2mz,"NTA, just got a pissed off TA "
9or7c9,"> I knew she had cheated on her last boyfriend with many guys over the course of years. this sounds worse than it is because he had basically said that she could do this as long as he didn't know because they would be apart from each other for long periods of time. To add to it, he had a low sex drive while she was quite the opposite and so that was their solution. 

It sounds worse than it is because, by definition, that isn't cheating. She's doing what they agreed upon... following the rules... get it? Not cheating.

> Then after a couple months of dating it came up that one of the people she was consistently sleeping with behind her boyfriends back was her best friends fiance 

Oh shit. Not the asshole, I'd have dumped her upon finding out."

9orv1r,"Yes, you definitely make it sound like you are.

You've omitted any point where you attempted to communicate with your roommate about this current issue other than an agreement you made at the beginning of the semester. You say that you have so ""many examples"" of how bad/rude of a roommate he is, but you also state that he has proven to be reasonable on many occasions (presumably when you brought your issues with his behavior to his attention).  It makes one wonder whether he is really a bad roommate, or if you constantly take issue with every little thing while he (admittedly) consistently tries to be accommodating when you bring up your issues.

It's not wrong of you to move out, but you should recognize that you not liking him as a roommate doesn't necessarily mean he is ""bad and rude"". Why not just be honest and say, ""Sorry, but I'm having a hard time and I feel like we have different expectations in our living arrangement. No one is in the wrong, and since I'm the one with the issue, I think it's best that I move so that hopefully we both find someone more similar to our own living style.""

But yes, you sound like the asshole who expects others to cater to your style of living when you share a room; especially with that cold shoulder crap.

&#x200B;"
9os7yh,"You sound like a bitter, jealous asshole. So yes, YTA."
9os9q1,get the fuck out of that relationship quickly my friend. also other the guy doesnt sound like he is your friend
9oserr,"I think it's understandable to be upset about it, maybe even a bit disappointed you don't get a lot of dedicated time with her, but I think a case can certainly be made that this might be a time where the best thing you can do right now is try to continue to be supportive and understanding. Often, people end up temporarily lessening time with loved ones in order to pursue college crud, especially when what they're doing is incredibly important to their future. That said, I believe in communicating feelings if they're important and making time for your partner regardless, though you still need to take into account how important it is for her, and squeezing you into smaller moments may still be her effort on her side to make time for you despite everything hitting so hard.

Does her school have any notable breaks coming up, where y'all could plan something? Even if it's like, a long distance movie night or something. Or, maybe having some solidified plan for when the semester is over would give you something to look forward to?"
9osgt7,"Not the asshole at all. You can’t put your life on hold for family members forever. You’ve got a chance to live your own life, and the timing is awkward as hell, but that doesn’t make you an asshole. If anything, they are for expecting you to stay on hold."
9osm09,I've pulled a prank like that on someone and I was an asshole to do it. You are not an asshole to be offended. You don't need that in your life.
9ot6sh,"No ones the asshole. Relationships and feelings are complicated. She did what she felt she needed to do to cope with the end of your relationship. You still care about her, which is entirely normal, and still wanted her for yourself. You can’t expect someone to put their life on hold to protect your feelings. "
9ote2n,"You’re not an asshole, but neither is your mom. You’re young and might not be making the best choice. She’s worried that you’re making a rash decision. "
9oth6d,Na you're good. Just make it a clean break then rack it up as a crazy ex girlfriend story.
9otxuw,NTA. he’s being a lazy asshole 
9ou1oz,"I think you’re an asshole. That tweet says to me that trans people shouldn’t care about what pronouns people use for them. You might think it’s not a fight worth fighting but people are literally being killed for trying to be themselves and have people acknowledge who they are.  There are gonna be people out there who are a part of a group but simply aren’t into the activist role. That doesn’t make them any more right than the outspoken, “faces of the movement” kinda people. 

Edit: the original tweet is fine. Your tweet is what I’m referencing, just in case it wasn’t clear. "
9oukht,Get over the relationship altogether now or it’s gonna get real heartbreaky.  Goodnight.
9oumbj,Not the asshole.  You've done enough.
9ouuec,"Not the asshole. 

Look, there are some things you don't joke about. Shooting up a school is one of them. The sad part is you can't always know if someone truly is kidding.

I had a classmate, Brian, who was super normal, had a great life from the outside. Most people admired him, he had a cute girlfriend, was on a sports team. One day, during lunch, he joked about stabbing a classmate with a knife. 

He said he was going to do it because the classmate was an asshole.  

I told Brian, ""Haha, okay, you're joking."" 

The next day he came to school with a knife. He showed another friend, told him the plan, thinking they would also laugh it off. That friend went to the principal's office. 

I now take all reports very seriously. You just never know. "
9ouy5h,">She has told me before to not do it,

You're an asshole.

> Edit: I feel like I should add: I didn't consider what I was doing harassing my sister.

Then you're wrong, and still an asshole."
9owgpa,"Not the a-hole atm. Feelings are often valid, and in the end you're probably best bringing them up with her for assurance in a non-accusatory way. Ultimately, you should trust her, where he may be just a friend and you have nothing to worry about, but she should ideally also respect that some things rub you the wrong way. 

I seriously hope y'all have time on the weekend to spend together, though. That schedule sounds really rough for having time to socialize with each other; I wouldn't be surprised if it did create a bit of a need or want for a friend to hang out with when you're not around, male or female. That said, it should still not threaten the relationship, so yeah: bring it up with her."
9owkh9,"NTA. Some expectation of privacy is normal. If your roommate had to ask you what possibly could have happened to make you distrust men, I have to wonder if she was raised under a rock.
Is it possible to get a more compatible roommate?"
9owvo4,you’re not the asshole. she’s a nymph who will fuck your brain harder than she ever fucked any other part of you. the smartest thing you did was not go back. 
9oxq4p,"No, definitely not. Sounds like P is a major asshole. "
9oyqbw,"Yep, you would be the asshole. You don't have a greater right to inhabit a public space than anyone else, and your baby isn't special nor does it confer special privileges which makes your opinions about what other people do in those public spaces matter. "
9oytfd,Very obviously NTA
9ozudm,"NTA. 

- > The dishwasher was full before the party

- > she feels she's been doing most of the unloading, which is partially true

But it also sounds like she isn't the asshole. Your other 2 roommates need to contribute as well and you need to set up a rule system for the future to keep this from happening."
9p000l,"If it was on a total whim of him just so happening to have a jacket, that is an asshole thing to do, but you had reasonable suspicions based on this guys track record. So no, not an asshole, but a bit dirty, but then again so is stealing."
9p1400,NTA. Can you change your door code?
9p24yd,"NTA. You can't actively control who you find hot and as long as you love your girl and treat her good, neither of you have anything to fear. It's not like you're cheating on her or neglecting her, you just find people attractive, that's all."
9p26be,"NTA - wasn't deliberate. Don't take the blame for the break, but don't take the credit for the upgrade; just let it rest."

9p2b5i,"He is the asshole. Where you sleep has absolutely nothing to do with him and doesn't effect him at all. If he is that concerned and wants to offer to pay for you guys to stay somewhere nicer then he can do that, otherwise he gets 0 opinion about where you guys sleep. In my opinion she need to talk to her dad and make it clear you guys want to spend time with him, but that is the way you can afford it. So you guys will visit and camp and don't want to hear his opinion, or you aren't coming. It is such a weird thing to be bitter about. Maybe a second option is your wife can just go and stay in his cabin and get some one on one time with him."

9p332l,"No assholes here.  It sounds like you have a really tough situation there, and are putting real effort in to treat her well and have a relationship.  I don’t think anyone among us who doesn’t have a severely mentally challenged sibling or child can really feel qualified to judge you here.  As long as you aren’t ignoring her entirely, and her care isn’t solely your responsibility, who can criticize?"
9p3543,Not the asshole. Your mother's opinion on tattoos is not something you have a responsibility to consider when determining what to do with your own body.
9p3ghs,"**Not the Asshole**.   While you share the house with three people equally, only you have a possession interest in your room.  You have the absolute right to dictate who goes in there absent exigent circumstances (like a leak).  If you do not feel comfortable with people you do not know in your room with your stuff while you are absent, which is entirely reasonable, you have the right to say no.  

Most important for purposes of assholism, you are not treading on or depriving anyone's rights here.  If you allowed them to use your room in the past, you did so out of courtesy.    Under normal circumstances, past courtesies do not entitle the recipient to future similar courtesy.  They have no right to expect you to allow them into your room. "
9p3pmk,"YATA, since I only have two choices.  But to explain it further - I think you genuinely want the best for your sister and are worried for her.  However, it’s none of your business, sister or not.  The fact that you’ve brought it up multiple times, even *after* realizing it just makes everyone mad...  well, that’s just dumb.

You mentioned that you have differences in beliefs.  That could also mean that the two of you have a different idea of things “working out”.  For some people, “not working out” is reserved for things like spousal abuse.  For everything else, you work through it, just as you would for blood relatives.

Finally, she’s not a child, and you’re not her mom.  You’ve already expressed your opinion.  It’s time to let it go and support your sister the best you can."
9p3sal,"I think you're rightful with your actions. Wrongful with your reasoning though. Dont do it because it effects them negatively, do it because it effects you positively. Live for yourself, not others. "
9p3uh9,"NTA 

But let me give you a little advice. I am a professional classical musician (violin) and an atheist. There will be tons of church gigs that pay very well if you choose to go the professional music route; you don’t have to believe in it, you just have to perform. Plus there’s actually a ton of sacred music that is some of the best in the choral literature (e.g., Bach Mass in B Minor or St Matthew Passion; Mozart Requiem).

If you feel really uncomfortable though I’m sure you could bring up religious grounds to your director and not have to perform. But it also might be a good experience to just “play the gig” if you’re considering a career in music.

9p4h1z,"Have you considered going to the appointments and focusing on the issues that you believe are caused by your ADHD? As you already know, Autism is a spectrum disorder so you may not present the typical symptoms. Not saying you do or do not have Autism, but I've been working with affected individuals for the last 12 years of my life and I've never met two people who were the same. Also I'm American and I dont know how things work in England, but I have come across a few parents that push doctors for an Autism diagnosis in order to have insurance cover certain services, have their kids go to specialized school, etc. Are you an asshole? No. Do I think you could still use these services to your advantage? Yes."
9p4jzk,NTA. I don’t see how anyone could think they’re the asshole in this situation smh
9p4lcx,"Hmm, NTA. A mistake is a mistake, and it might have even been a blessing is disguise. 

While your answer was kinda mean and untrue, it did get her to stop messaging you after your (I'm guessing pretty messy) break up. "
9p4op2,"I would say yes, you do not know he is feeling.  All these women could be just him trying to fill the void of not having your mother.

9p5zh2,"Of course not. You're not abandoning your country by living abroad. It's your life to experience, live wherever you want to live. "
9p6g1f,"Yep you're an asshole. If you love your sister and know you're not making an effort, then get off your arse and make an effort?

Do you know how shitty it is to think someone doesn't give a damn about you?

How hard is it to send a text saying hi Sis love you hope you're good xoxo

And you definitely should have shut your laptop. Everyone carries regrets around with them don't let your sister become one, she's going to simply give up one day and you'll never get your relationship back. "
9p7m8t,You're not the asshole for getting angry. Dude. She chopped up an animal while it was alive like she was some kind of psychopath. Her and her friends are all assholes. 
9p7o0j,"Yes. He was an asshole. You were an asshole. Driving is dangerous enough, why play stupid petty games when you don't have to?"
9p7wzd,"EDIT: Ok, since the OP has clarified, I'm going with Not the Asshole.  The fact that she wants stuff sent to her so she can be the angel of mercy that gives it all the way seals the deal.  Grandma is being sketchy.

This is so situational.  Your grandmother really might be feeling torn up about the devastation to an area she has ties with.  She might not be thinking how her posts make her look like more of a victim than she really is. On the other hand, she could just be trying to garner attention for herself to make her feel important.  Without knowing more about her character, it's really hard to say.

If this is really bothering you, you might try posting something on her wall along the lines of ""So sorry for those who have suffered such terrible loss, and we're all very grateful that at least your house was spared in this tragedy.""  If she deletes or flips her lid, you know you're in the clear."
9p8krl,"NTA, but you should probably just drop it off yourself and not let them handle the replacement. If an angry housemate is made to walk an hour like that, who knows if it will actually make it, or if he’ll toss it in the dumpster and say it got lost in the mail. I wouldn’t take the chance. "
9p8r4s,">When she told me she wanted to name our baby that, I got mad and acted coldly toward her for the rest of the night. I'm still a little upset. Am I overreacting about this?     

Yes.    

The proper reaction would be to discuss it. Explain why you feel the way you do and talk it over.  

If you two can't calmly discuss problems and learn how to express your feelings verbally you are doomed."
9p9lkx,"You aren’t the asshole and while I would have liked your solution, that doesn’t mean others would. I would have liked having the option to get something else, but I can totally see how someone would just want the same thing at that instant. 

You could have told him the night of and asked if he wanted a book from the shop or a card to order something else. You could have done that before seeing him again though and had what he wanted ready. "
9p9wpx,"Absolutely 100%, 1 million% not the asshole here. In fact, it was brave of you to say what you did, even though it was hard and has made you feel bad. You did what no one else could do - set boundaries. 

You are not responsible for ANYONE'S mental health. Anyone who cannot respect your boundaries on the support that you are able to provide is taking advantage of you.

I know it hurts, and I know you're concerned, but Sabrina has been using you all, taking energy from you which you don't have to give, and now is causing drama elsewhere.

I'm going to say at a guess that these attention seeking behaviours are a part of her mental illness (I've seen shit this before in people with BPD/HPD) and you are not a paid professional who's responsibility it is to deal with this.

YOU get to decide how much support you give a friend. I think you should remind your other friends that while she clearly has problems, so do all of you - and that it's not your faults that she couldn't respect that none of you had the energy or mental verve to be her audience."
9pb2sc,"NTA. Sure, you could have chosen a more neutral response, but she could have chosen not to be an asshole to you for years. She gets to feel momentarily embarrassed about that."
9pbei8,You are the asshole because it’s completely voluntary decision and you don’t know how they are really doing despite how they look. Maybe they are drowning in bills from other stuff. Personally I think it’s a optional thing
9pbg4g,That sounds more like a coupon than a gift card tbh — and coupons aren’t generally refundable 
9pbk22,You wouldn't be. They won't have any autonomy at all if they die on the road.
9pblhx,"Funny that you judge her for hooking up with a ""major douche,"" but not yourself for being friends with one. YTA."
9pbp2r,"You came clean. You did the right thing. You abused her, therefore I think she should dictate whether or not it is ever mentioned again. Pressuring her by bringing it up could quite possibly make things much worse, and ruin the good terms you're on. Just don't mention it. Be nice to her. Do things for her, just don't make it obsequious. Just be like a good friend to her. You may find she'll forgive you in time.

You're not the asshole for apologizing."
9pbwau,"Yes, 3 weeks isnt that long for non-urgent matters depending on where you are located. You also dont have to go to that particular doctor. Find one with a more accommodating schedule. If you want to visit this specific doctor for a reason, just wait for the appointment. "
9pceql,"I wouldn’t call you an asshole, I think it was just a mistake. Sounds like something I would do honestly.

If you can though I’d delete the comment and privately apologize and explain to her what happened. "
9pcipq,"I wouldn’t think so.... he was exposing himself to children on the internet. If you shamed him into putting it away, so much the better. "
9pco6l,"Both assholes here, edge to your roommate for poor communication. 

You are right, working together and living together is a LOT.  Add wanting to socialize with the same person as well and that can become too much. Everyone needs space sometimes. (I worked and lived with one of my roommates for 7 years. We had a couple of blowouts but are still friends today.)

Taking your roommate’s food without asking is shitty behavior. Just because he didn’t say anything until your blow-up doesn’t mean he was okay with it. Honestly, it’s clear that he wasn’t okay with it (otherwise he wouldn’t have snapped at you). This is another indication of your roommate’s poor communication habits. Slamming stuff around and punching walls is not okay. He needs to learn to speak up when things bother him before it gets to explosive anger stage. 

At this point, you are an adult and should be working on building a social circle outside of him and his social circle. I’m not saying you won’t be able to be friends with his friends as well, but maybe ease up on hanging out with them for a bit. You do admit to being ‘too boisterous’ when drinking and that some find you ‘overbearing’, so it could be that they need a break from you as well. 
"
9pd4pg,"You’re not the asshole for being frustrated at this situation; it sounds exhausting. You *are* the asshole for yelling at your wife about it. You acknowledge that the crazy sports schedule isn’t her idea. I would try to deal with this in a way that doesn’t involve punishing her for something that really isn’t her fault.

I also don’t think it’s fair to say she’s “not a mother anymore” when she is constantly busy taking care of *her child*. And I think you should consider whether the relationship is suffering not only because she’s so busy, but also because of the way you are treating her.

Is there a reason you can’t take her son to games sometimes and let her spend time with the baby?"
9pd8uv,"You're not an asshole, you're a coward. Grow a pair, tell her you want to break up with her and tell her to either pay rent or move out. If you want to be nice you can give her 90 days to get a job and start paying up.

She has the luxury of acting like a delusional idiot because you keep enabling and sheltering her. She'll wise up fast when she learns that no, the world does not actually work that way."
9pdc9b,"NTA at all. TBH I’d argue it’s more misogynistic for him to tell you you’re letting them disrespect you and expecting them to not include you in something that’s pretty common in pretty much any team dynamic just because you’re a girl. Just as long as you’re okay with it and they’re not treating every girl like that, there’s not really anything wrong with it. "
9pe7xo,NTA and should leave the relationship.
9pe9hn,"No, she seems terrible, and you need someone around who actually cares "
9peghc,Yta the cat isn't her responsibility nor did she feed the cat detergent and you yourself checked out the cat and thought it was fine. she contacted your bf about the cat how much more can she do. Bottom line you left the cat to die and since the cat is yours your more culpable than she is and you saw the cat after her. Sorry but the facts are facts and you stated them.
9pf8et,Lol just get away from those drama queens it's not worth it
9pfog4,"NTA. Also yes, threatening suicide is abuse. 

Within my group of friends, we cut off any abuser who makes another friend uncomfortable. If we were friends IRL and you said that me associating with so-and-so triggered really weird feelings, you can count on that person being as good as gone. I don’t associate with abusers ~especially~ if it made another one of my friends uncomfortable.

I also don’t really count on people changing all that much. If one of my friends abused me and  others, that’s it. No second chances. To me, second chances are reserved for things like accidentally blowing off a coffee date. Because of my pickiness, I only have 2 friends I enjoy keeping close. My life is a bit quiet lol. 

TL/DR: You’re not an asshole if your friends hang out with people that aggravate any sort of trauma from a past abuse. I’d question your friends to be honest. "
9pfov7,"I think this would be fine, probably wouldn't do anything disrespectful concerning their beliefs but the basic costume is probably fine. Anyways they dont have twitter so it's not like they will put you on blast like other cultures might."
9pfqfz,Yes.
9phcc7,"Not the asshole.  You are totally in your right to tell them not to smoke in an area that's clearly designated non-smoking.  In addition to the whole second hand smoke issue, you don't know what kind of flammable materials could be around the area. 

The guy who tried to intimidate you was in the wrong, and it sounded like he knew he was in the wrong.  The women were just straight up entitled assholes."
9phqat,No. He deserved to know
9pl1wd,"You would be the asshole if you told her.  It is not your place.  Leave that to the next of kin (your parents and their siblings).  That being said, them withholding the information makes them an asshole."
9pl91g,"NTA. Incredibly difficult situation to manage considering you don’t know if he stopped, sought help etc. however, this isn’t for revenge or anything, but out of concern for innocent children so id say you did the right thing.

Hopefully he gets the help he needs or even better, already has started that journey "
9pl9mc,"NTA, you're an innocent bystander who got caught up in her drama. Lying to you (saying she was single), trying to bend your morals (cheating, when you obviously disapprove of that behavior)

I'd say let vengence rain upon her treasonous head. You owe her nothing. You owe allllllllll of that nonsense nothing. DM him hard and drop the mic, never speak to them again! (Yeah, the bf, too.)"
9plgn9,[deleted]
9plvdo,"You are most definitely the asshole. Friend, brother, it doesn't matter. Here's the deal - as you grow a bit older, you will probably not remain as close. Maybe you move apart. I did with my brothers. You might only get a few more birthdays to spend together ever. 

Please don't skip one of them for a video game. Not even for one you have a (very tiny) chance of winning some money at. "
9pm7el,"No, he’s the asshole for trying to commit suicide over a relationship in his teen years. If he just can’t deal at this point, whoosh, life is going to bitch slap him all over the block. 

You are an alright dude. You were there for your friend, you were concerned for the dude as well, and you feel empathy for others, hence why you feel bad. 

By contrast what empathy did he show?  He wanted to hurt the girl by basically saying “you killed me”.  He didn’t care about her feelings or what she wanted.  That’s being an asshole. 

Keep doing you. "
9pmu6u,YTA - it's a clothing store; not a library. 
9pnaty,"Not totally the asshole. 

The infatuation portion of a relationship always fades and transforms into something else. "
9pnum5,"To be something for your friend, you need to be something for yourself first.

You cannot support her if she exhausts you. You need to recharge the batteries now and then. Don’t feel bad for the alone time with your bf.

You might want to go to therapy with her once, to talk about these issues, so the therapist can help. If your friend will allow it.

You don’t mention how long ago the rape was, and besides the healing process is individual. 

To give an example, I was raped when 18, I stopped having nightmares each night around 23-24. I started dating again at 22. This is just to say, that it will most likely get better in time, but it takes time. So hang in there.
"
9pnvqh,"I don't think you're the asshole at all. You made your intentions clear from the start, and it's okay to not want extra responsibility. It's difficult enough for most of us to care for ourselves properly, let alone with added responsibility.
I am married with two kids, and we have a dog as well as a cat. I was slightly against getting either, because I knew it would be extra work for me, and I work my ass off. I was convinced and we adopted both within six months of each other.
Since then, I love them both, but I inevitably have had to clean accidents over and over and deal with the stink of a litter box. They do enrich our lives, and i love them, but damn am i tired of the house stinking. 
Basically, what you choose is okay. You ultimately did the right thing and found her a warm home where she will be loved. That's all that matters. Good on you!"
9po049,"NTA, He knew full well what the possible consequences of his actions could lead to since he has done it before, if anything he is the asshole for putting you in a personal moral dilemma (that dilemma being: is his wrong doing worthy of jail concidering the car was unlocked and he didn't take anything)"
9po0jp,"NTA... wrong time, wrong situation. The bus driver just happened to be ""that"" guy. Don't worry about it. "
9pocxl,"Nobodies the asshole in this situation. It’s hard when a family member is slipping away and it’s hard being reminded of someone close to you dying. It would’ve been better if you went, but it doesn’t make you the asshole that you didn’t."

Unless the situation was where the reference to white boy nerds was relevant, then what you did was insulting and unnecessary.  Yes, it can be racist because it means, in your mind, the language spoken in East Asia is only relevant to you because of obsessive white boys. 

Also it was a bad joke. "

9praxi,"No, you’re not the asshole. People like that are emotional vampires. I’d run for the hills if I were you."
9prf7i,"YTA. It sounds to me like he was being playful and not malicious in any way. I also don't understand why you asked, ""Would you do what you did to a stranger? Kick them? Put a cockroach on their head"" because he didn't do either of those things. The reason he wouldn't kick a bug at a stranger is because a stranger wouldn't know he was joking around, not because he respects them more. And a stranger wouldn't take two hours out of their day to drive you to and from your extracurricular, so perhaps it is you who should show more respect. "
9prgol,"NTA. Your resentment is understandable. It's too late for your father to act like a Dad. But if he feels guilty maybe you can take baby steps with him. Not go meet his new family. But at least try to get to know him. If things go sour, you turned out fine without him. But if things go good, you can let him into your life within your comfort level."

9prssd,"Do you pay rent?  Does person who parked in your spot pay rent?

If your sequence of answers goes “yes” followed by “no” then the only way you’d be the asshole is if you had Jim’s last friend’s car towed before checking to see if someone would kindly move their fucking car."
9ps99w,"I don't think you are, but I laughed at ""I asked him about hummus"""
9ptq6a,In no way are you the asshole here. 
9pu896,"I’m going to say no, you aren’t. 

Wether he was 100% in control of picking your ring or 50%, he still should have considered your style and what you suggested. It’s a tough spot though, because he’s proud of it, but it sucks wearing something that isn’t “you.”

Maybe suggest going band shopping together if he hasn’t already purchased your band. See what you can work out, and go from there. I personally only wear an anniversary band daily and my Wedding set is in my safe. I also know plenty of women who do the same."
9pvahy,Absolutely NTA
9pwbrh,"NTA for telling her, but you could have found a better way/time.

I understand where your wife is coming from even if she overreacted. From her poing of view she is showing you fun stuff to make you feel better. She thinks that despite your headache you are enjoying yourself. She probably does not realise how loud she is laughing. - So, everything is fine. And then, it is not.

In fact, aparently what she was doing for several minutes actually hurt you. She was *not* helping, you did *not* have a nice bonding time. She percieved the whole situation completely different to you. 

That realisation is like a punch in the gut. Especially if you, after not saying anything for so long,  sounded more snappy than planned. ( which tends to happen in cases where we are trying not to let on that something is hurting or frustrating till it just becomes too much.)

And now she is mad. Mad at herself for not realising her laughter was to loud, you did not enjoy yourself. Mad at you for ruining the picture of what she thought was happening. Mad at you for being mad. Mad at herself for being mad at you when you are feeling ill. Its a tangle of dissspointment and anger and, seriouserly, the *best* she can do right now is going somewhere else, disengageing, before this stupid little situation becomes an actual fight.

That she said you should not have said  anything at all was stupid and not nice wt all of her. "
9pwm2e,"Yes, hookups and rekindling an old flame are two different things."
9py7hb,Lol definitely not an asshole. I see people eating literally everyday on the bus on my way to and from work. Unless you’re leaving crumbs and wrappers all over I don’t think it’s a big deal. 
9pydz2,"NTA. People drift apart, especially with distance. People change, especially over time. I don’t talk to anyone from sleepaway camp or high school. I talk to a handful of people from college. As time goes on, people and relationships change. Not your fault. That’s just life. 

Could you have reached out? Sure. Are you wrong for not doing so? No, not at all. "
9pywbj,"Nta.  If you want to be super cool, invite him to something you enjoy doing as a counter offer."
9pyzpf,"NTA. She gave it to you, should have at least split it."
9pzbia,No. I would have left no tip lol. And I have before! We actually heard the same person talking in the back that the last person didn't leave them a tip. Gee I wonder why. 
9q14gj,NTA. I’ve had some moronic or unfair admins in the past it’s pretty fun to fuck with them. Don’t go overboard or make it an obsession because then you’d be the asshole 
9q15g9,"Meh. Not the asshole, but if you continue to act like that you may be.

Yes, having your character act ""in character"" is important and part of the game, but you are playing with others and if you continiousely cut into their enjoyment of the game you become the asshole for being annoying.

Try to find a way your paladdin can let go of unfair anger. Maybe... hmm, what's his belief system? It must be importasnt to him. Is there any way it could help him to lose his anger or target it in the right direction only?  If it is the second you can even play him as conflicted ( following believe system or honour code but deeply mistrusting of drow anyway). - Basically, find a good in-character reason for him to not act so much like an ass it hurts your reasl life frirnds ejoyment on tge game."
9q1d75,"How questionable we talking here?

15 vs 1 fist fights?

Selling contraband?

8 year olds?

Gangs dealing in sex trade?



As a general rule of thumb- only assholes give ultimatums. If you don’t like ol dude, then just don’t hang out with him. No need to make a scene just to prove you’re a better person, because making a scene about how someone you just met goes about their business in life is almost always an automatic association with assholistic tendencies. "
9q1e4b,"NTA. You are not a taxi service and as a friend of good standing she should at least offer to pay for petrol or money towards the cost of her travel. 

Ask if she can give you money for petrol, she owns a car, she knows how expensive petrol can be! But affirm that you won't be giving her free lifts with you going out of your way without payment. 

EDIT: she's an asshole. She has the means for travel and she chooses to use your generosity to her advantage for free travel. "
9q1ewh,"In my opinion, NTA. I feel like you definitely should’ve tried tapping on the window first, but at the same time you did do the right thing.

I wouldn’t even argue that it was unfortunate she got arrested. What if she tried to drive off while she was drunk?"
9q1kbv,"If you like her, date her, but be careful that she's not using you to get to him."
9q1keo,"Yes. You’re an asshole. That’s really petty. I’m not saying your wife wasn’t out of line, bc she was... but throwing away a gift you got someone bc of a fight is super petty.  To me, I’d be concerned the flower thing was an indication that your wife has a problem with something bigger, and I’d want to find out what that is."
9q1t1s,NTA. That is borderline harrassment that your management should have acted on.
9q27cz,NTA. You have that right
9q2ksh,"NTA if he seems unbothered. Since you're willing to eat expired stuff, might as well continue. You'll be saving money and food that would've gone to waste otherwise. Don't really see the need to offer him anything in return for expired things. But you can treat him to a meal every now and then if you feel like it."
9q2mba,"NTA

that old prick needs to mind his own business "
9q2sqc,"The sign OP described sounds like it's the same as the ones in my city. If you go to their website for a full explanation of the rules, it states that that picture means you can't have volume on your phone; not that you can't use your phone at all.

Also, it's not their bus. It's the companies bus. You don't get to make up new rules or change rules just because you're driving that one.

Edit; Also, OP said the company didn't do anything because they didn't believe him. Not because it wasn't wrong of the bus driver to do. They clearly would have had an issue with the bus driver doing this if they had believed it really happened."
9q34pa,"**only because we have to include a verdict:**  you're the asshole, but it's out of ignorance, not malice.

DHEC is very strict about cleanliness. I work in the back of the house of a restaurant, and during our DHEC drills (we conduct them to keep the staff on their toes) we've been marked down for seemingly minor things. as a customer, you're not expected to know about these high standards, but as a rule: keep your mucus membranes away from communal serving containers.

I agree that the manager should not have made such a huge show; maybe they're very protective of their ""A"" rating or recently got a lower grade and are extra touchy now, but treating a guest that way isn't cool."
9q39vj,"Not the asshole. 

You tried to organise an event, some people came, some people didn’t. Sounds like you went out of your way to try and fit in with everyone - if there was miscommunication or misunderstanding then it doesn’t sound intentional. 

PS if there is “no love lost” between two people it actually means they hate each other. Not sure exactly why, to be honest - I guess it’s like “absolutely no love whatsoever is used up between those two people”. But it’s the opposite of what I assume you thought!"
9q3s2m,"Did you maintain eye contact as you finished the panini? 

but seriously NTA, I hate it when people make awkward requests like that. "
9q49na,"NTA.  They have a menu, they offer service, if at 30, 45 min check ins the food wasn't out, then you had every right to refuse the service."
9q4eol,"NTA for a lot of reasons.
Stay solid in your ""No"".
I'll say upfront that I'm quite anti-drugs myself, but I do believe that has zero bearing on my interpretation of this situation.

Firstly, it sounds like your GF and Em had almost made this a done deal in their minds in your absence so NTA for going ""Hang on... wtf?!"".

Secondly, you have no way of knowing how your GF will react on either the up OR the down, so with the other two surely partaking, would you be expected not to or would they rather everyone was equally fucked in the case that something went wrong?!

Thirdly, who is this guy? Why should you be expected to be ok with meeting him for the 1st time in that kind of scenario?

I'm sure there will be more when I go back and read your post a 3rd time but I really do think that's enough to be sure you're not the asshole on this one!

"
9q4hz5,"Unless there's something I'm really missing about pool etiquette, I'd say not the asshole. 

It certainly wasn't worth arguing as long as you did, though. I doubt you could have changed their minds."
9q4q0j,"Not the asshole.  Your wedding is for you and your husband, other people don't get a say in how you arrange the ceremony or whom you invite.  If your uncle makes you uncomfortable you have every right to not invite him.  When other family members try to argue with you about it just remember that ""No."" is a complete sentence."
9q4q4u,"Sounds like you both are running off assumptions instead of clear communication. Neither are assholes, just living with unskillful communication. "
9q57hi,Do you get the work done if y’all don’t plan it out? Parents can be like that you’re NTA but neither are they since this is normal shit for them to want to talk about
9q6em5,[deleted]
9q71u1,"NTA. They knew you were moving, so it wasn't like you blindsided them. Also, there's nothing wrong with cutting toxic people from your life. As you grow up, you're going to find that friendshops made with people you knew as teenagers aren't always long lasting- and that's okay. You're going to develop new friendships, and maybe one day you'll reconnect, maybe you won't. But honestly, it's up to them- they didn't even come to your wedding! Do you really want these people in your life? "
9q73yi,"You're never an asshole for ending a relationship that is detrimental to your own mental or emotional state. 

It's how you end it that makes you an asshole or not. "
9q7vdw,"NTA. I do a mix of polite no responses and ghosting. Sometimes I am already having an annoying day and  am probably not going to say something nice anyway, better to be silent."
9q8qri,"You’re right that it’s stupid to draw sweeping conclusions from two magazines. On the other hand, a little cultural awareness would’ve gone a long way. The evidence is poor, but the conclusion is still correct. "

And no, I don't think that makes you an asshole for not wanting to be called that. "
9q9kea,NTA. I also do not consider babies appropriate movie theater humans either. Annoying as f***
9qa1zn,"So . . . you paid for a service (or your parents did) and then decided to not make use of the service?  Not an asshole, but likely a dumbass."
9qa37w,"I say you are the asshole. By your own statement, he brings a lot to the relationship and household. If he’s working to pay the bills and you’re not able to bring in a paycheck, then it falls to you to take responsibility for the household. It’s simply too much to ask of a person to be the sole breadwinner and also be expected to work when they get home from work. Of course this is only my opinion, but I feel I need to qualify it by saying I am currently looking for work and therefor in a similar setup, although without the debilitation(s) that you are dealing with"
9qa9pu,"Bit of both really, you didnt do it with the intent of being an asshole, but if you had your priorities straight you would have taken the call which would of avoided this whole predicament "
9qac5t,"NTA. My parents flipped their shit when they found out I was an atheist. Even more so when I started dating a Muslim woman. As for dealing with it, I doubt anything is going to change their minds. Are you entirely dependant on them or can you look after yourself (once you're 18 of course)? "
9qanvv,yes. YTA. easy as that
9qarax,"NTA. Been in a similar roommate situation. You just have to decide if having your own room trumps moving in with your friends. I shared a room and it was fine.

It's understandable to be frustrated in this situation but sharing a house is just as bad as sharing a room when you have experienced living by yourself, which you will one day. Don't sweat it."
9qavvy,"Asshole. Sidewalk is for pedestrians road is for bikes and cars, anything else is unacceptable. You either need to get off and push your bike or accept that cars will overtake when it is safe to do so. "
9qb9wc,"Y’all are clearly very young, so you’re both assholes by default. Y’all both get very annoyed with each other’s nephew/niece apparently. The only difference is YOU made the joke about scratching her nephew. She’s allowed to be offended by that and by you disliking her nephew, just like you were offended by how she talked about your relationship with your niece. She didn’t do that “””out of vengeance”””. She did it to prove a point of “How would you like it if I talked about your loved one like that?” and you proved her point. Apologize to her and find some way for the both of y’all to love each other’s families and accept differences more."
9qbgy1,"You're the asshole.  Judging by the fact that you're calling he a slutty in the title and the judgmental tone of your post, it seems likely that she has problem with you in particular, not guys in general.  Taking a ""You're a slut, therefore you have no right to any say in the matter"" is clearly an asshole position.
"
9qbpcq,"NTA with the pens IMO, only cos in my workplace I have had so many people “borrow” and never return. 

Keys that also have your own personal ones attached is risky - if you lose them, you’re screwed. But that’s your choice do for safety sake I wouldn’t let someone else use them either 

Bathrooms I’m more sympathetic with; pregnant people, kids, people who have urinary/gastro issues can urgently need to use one. 

"
9qcspw,"You’re a bit of an asshole, you could have been nicer about the situation. However, you both sound childish. Definitely need to work on your communication skills. "
9qd181,"Are you an asshole for still being afraid of someone who pretty much physically abused you as a kid?

I'm gonna go ahead and say nah. You take all the time you need to deal with this however you see fit.

>It's a normal thing for siblings to tease and beat up each other

Tease? Yeah. Beat up? Nope. Real, physical violence in the family home is not normal."
9qd1s4,"without knowing what he said or did to be classed as toxic it sounds like you're the asshole. Fair play to him if he's wasted and played a support class to contribute to the team. Your comments out of context seem bitter and smarmy.

I'm all for slating toxic teammates, but to me, a teammate who causes division in the team is much worse than someone trying to contribute, no matter their playstyle."
9qd2um,"No. You aren't the arsehole whatsoever. I mean, arguably it's a little silly, but, they should still say thanks from time to time"
9qddpj,Yep. Pretty much. You don't own the seat. She had as much right as you to sit wherever she pleases.
9qdkdn,"Yeah, you're not the asshole here. Threats of physical violence aren't cool, and it sounds like your dad has a real problem if he *has* to be right all the time.

That said, maybe you could use to pick your battles, particularly if you're with someone who's going to hit you for being right.

Sometimes, being right is something you sit on quietly, because if someone's as insufferable as your dad, you can be as right as you like and it will change nothing."
9qdvo2,Are you an asshole for pointing out something illegal and endangering to the authorities? No youre not. You are a Bit of an asshole for knowing this Story doesnt make you an asshole and still Posting it here though.
9qe0vq,"I wouldn’t consider you an asshole but you should keep in mind that him not being on medication and learning to control himself without it is also a viable option. I think it’s unfair to make your brother go on something that he doesn’t want to go on when there are other things he can do.

I think your parents giving him somewhat of an ultimatum would be acceptable. They could try their hardest to make sure your brother displays appropriate behavior without anything, and if that fails to work medication should probably be considered."
9qe6yy,"Hmmm, how likely is it that he offended locally? Will publishing it do any material benefit to people locally? Or will it just fuel the town gossip mill, and harm his wife and kids?

If you had evidence he offended locally, I might be tempted to tell you to go for it, to give a voice to any victims who might be ignored or unheard.

But otherwise... it's just going to hurt his wife and kids even more, and that would make you the asshole.



"
9qebi9,"nta. i had a friend like that too. he travels to Jamaica a lot, hes big into pot culture, rasta culture, etc. he has a daughter who is named after a Jamaican word for cannabis. 

he used to come outside with his baby wrapped up in his arms, with a lit joint in his mouth. we all told him we thought the baby should stay inside, and we didnt like that he would smoke around her. same thing, otherwise he is probably a great dad. 

i stopped hanging with him for that reason and quite a few others. i think its totally fine to smoke pot but kids shouldnt be exposed to it until a much older age and really shouldnt smoke it themselves until at least 16 or so, and even then, sparingly. 

for reference on my standpoint, i smoke a lot of cannabis (huge dab in the morning, couple during the work day sometimes, couple big dabs after work /before bed)"
9qegmv,"Yes you're an asshole. He is too for not respecting basic hygiene, but basically, you were to big of a baby to go over and talk to him, so you started indirectly shit talking him."
9qeq9u,"There is no fucking way this is real. 

For the sake of judgment, NTA. YTA if this is fake though, which it probably is. "
9qet2w,No you’re NTA and this is a weird thing to ask if you’re an asshole about. You’re just from the US and most of the people you interact are presumably from the US so it’s natural to be like “Oh they’re from the US unless proven otherwise.”
9qettz,"YNTA.  He's the asshole.  If you're going to own a pet, you've got to be ready to take care of it.  It's his responsibility and he can't expect to be able to always pawn it off on the people around him."
9qewaf,NTA now put in that noise complaint
9qexan,"NTA, just mute them or something."
9qezly,"NTA.

I am an epileptic.

Not your fault.

9qg09u,YNTA.  Some assholes need to be called out for being assholes so maybe (and it's a long shot) they'll learn to stop being assholes someday.
9qgaz6,"NTA. Also, it sounds like someone doesn't want your notes after all. "
9qgdpu,"Not the asshole, if you are sharing the space and not monopolizing it... and you even note you are doing this before your clock in time so I see no issue."
9qgqab,"He’s going to bed late because he’s playing video games, you’re going to bed at a reasonable time because you don’t want to be overtired for work. I don’t think it’s fair to you to wake you up just because he wants to play video games all night/early morning. "
9qgr8a,"Yes, YTA. You aren't technically in the wrong, as you can decide what to bring into your car, but you were being an asshole. She wanted to bring her food, in a bag, in her purse. That won't leave much of a smell, and it'll fade very quickly. It's really not a big deal.

Also, it doesn't matter at all whether she paid for it or not, and it was a dick move to bring it up."
9qh3me,"Are you an orthopedic physician qualified to make these kinds of medical assessments?

9qhw0q,[deleted]
9qhy0a,"Asshole. You made false promises. Came through for another friend, thus making her feel even more slighted. On top of that you don’t seem to care if you hurt your friend’s feelings.

"
9qia4c,"NTA. I’ve heard of parents doing this before and they’re only harming themselves. If you have no training and don’t feel comfortable looking after the kids, you shouldn’t. 

It’s the parents’ responsibility to find a good babysitter. And if they can’t afford it, they can’t go out. That’s unfortunately part of the sacrifices that comes with being a parent "

9qj19s,"NTA. Regardless of life or death this dude was an abuser and just because he died does not automatically make that okay. Your family shouldn’t be trying to force you into anything especially for the sole fact of, “But it’ll make us look bad!!1!! :(“. 

You stand your ground and if people get pissed off, so be it. "
9qjj4o,"he is the asshole. also, he sounds verbally abusive. it starts with small put downs but let me tell you it grows over time. drop that asshole like a hot potato."

9qk0hj,"For simply being annoyed? Nope, you are not the asshole. - Just dont suddendly explode on your coworker.

Thing is, though,  if your place plays loud music it is *not* a work place you can compare with the library in how loud people should be. You may have to adapt your expectations of ""professional behaviour"" in this setting."
9qklmk,You can’t choose who you’re attracted to. As long as you treat everyone with respect and don’t mock or humiliate those who you find unattractive you’re good to go. 
9qklog,Nta but I think there is an argument for making girls scouts the same level set as Boy Scouts. Like more on camping and survival and not just selling cookies.
9qkytk,Red flag !!! Get out while she's not pregnant!!
9ql3wo,"Erm. Well.  I get his point. But they’re just doing their jobs. They don’t create the rules. They just follow them. They have zero say in what they can enter in the computer to allow a refund. If he was acting completely like a dick, it’s his fault. He should’ve contacted corporate if he felt so passionate about maintaining his personal information. Not the cashiers fault at all. "
9ql6ni,"I run an animal shelter.  I encourage people to return dogs if it’s not working out... even if I suspect the reason it’s not working out is the adopter’s fault.  I’d rather just put them in another home than the dog and adopter make themselves miserable.

That being said, if they’re a bonded pair it’s all or nothing.  Return them both or don’t return either."
9ql9yo,"NTA you're in the right who to sociate with outside of work. At work, he is your coworker and at best, acquaintance."
9qlq9g,"NTA. You'd be totally fine to refuse changing your hair; your office has no work code, and in your field there's a lot of people who don't adhere to traditional standards of professionalism. So, morally, you're fine.

&#x200B;

That said, I would weigh the benefits of keeping your hair against the drawbacks of pissing your boss off. Personally, I wouldn't want to work at a place where the color of my hair made a significant impact on how I was treated. So, if your boss is anything less than grudgingly understanding, I would look for a new place of employment. But that's just me. "
9qm0gf,"If your brother was fine with you not being there right away I dont see the problem, I'd do the same thing in the situation, your going to meet them eventually, it doesn't mean you care less because you werent there, it just means you value other peoples personal space "
9qm1rb,"Well this is a slightly different situation.  You aren’t really paying your in laws for child care.  That’s just a bonus.  You are *supporting* your in laws as dependents.  If they were less capable you’d be spending the same money or more on a nursing home or care givers.  This way they can at least feel like they helping the family out, and feel some dignity.  

You can’t treat your dependents like employees.  They will always need more than they can give.  You support them because you love them and they need you. "
9qmftd,"I'm going to say that your behaviour so far hasn't been assholish, but you need to assess your future behaviour to make sure you don't become the asshole.

Look, your friendship with this guy seems really important to you - that's why you're annoyed at his behaviour, right? Cause you value him, and the time you spend together.

Now, he's being kind of an asshole, what with him neglecting his friendships. But with any luck this will be a few months assholery from him, which you can revisit with him when his head is out of the clouds and back on planet earth.

So - do you really want to end this friendship over a few months of assholery? Do you really want to burn those bridges?"
9qmyzf,You're definitely nta. She made a deal and should adhere to the deal UNLESS you intentionally withheld information from her that would otherwise prevent her from making the deal in the first place. 
9qn586,Not the asshole. It wasn't your job and you weren't trained on how to do it so the result would have been the same had you made an attempt and fucked it up somehow because you didn't know what you were doing. It was your boss's job and his fault but he didn't want to answer for it so he put it on you. 
9qnayy,NTA... this whole situation sounds toxic.  I'd say it's time to cut your losses and find some new friends.
9qnbfi,NTA you weren't expecting to see them and didn't know how to react. You could apologise for being awkward and ask how their doing
9qnnhm,Yes. She instigated the physical conflict by throwing a bag at his head. Should have kept him from hurting her but not by hurting him
9qo0jb,No you're not. She needs to fuck off.
9qo5ri,"You're not really an asshole but you are careless and in the wrong.

Apologizing immediately and being genuine about it is what makes you not the asshole. However, this all could have been avoided if you used your words like a Big Boy TM and simply asked him to move over a little; This is where you became careless.

Also, something being an accident doesn't absolve you of the responsibility to pay for damages. This is where you're in the wrong. You're the one who damaged it, it would still be totally fine if it wasn't for you. It's not even a case where you could fight for 50/50 responsibility because he wasn't doing anything reckless or careless. You just didn't think to ask him to move over, you got pushy, and the laptop got damaged as result.

So not really the asshole here as the guy accepted your apology and seemed willing to move on. But work on using your words and also claiming responsibility. Those are very important skills in the adult world."
9qo9db,"No. You told her in previous conversations that if your ex is around it is a problem. You also are mature enough to realize that alcohol will make the problem worse. You are putting your foot down and she may not like it, but it is your choice.
 If you really feel the need to say something, I would tell her something along the lines of this:
 I appreciate all the work that you have done and I love you, but you know how I feel about my exes.  Alcohol is going to be a problem and I want to cut that problem off before it even starts.   You know how I feel and yet you invited them anyway. I understand you're friends with them, but in situations like this you must choose.  Maybe I will see you at your next party. Or maybe we can catch up with a coffee. But I refuse to go to this party. "
9qp7go,"Your post is a bit hard to understand. Am I summing this up correctly?

- Friend B has mobility issues with walking. 
- Everyone wanted to ride a cab or ride the bus except Friend B. 
- Friend B wants to walk. 
- Friend B ends up hating the walk and gets pissed off that he had to walk. 

If so, you are not the asshole, this is on Friend B. If you have health issue and other people are willing to accommodate for you then it's your responsibility to ensure that everything works out properly. "
9qpcp9,"Wow. Hard to beleive people like this exist in real life. Her not even telling the father shes getting an abortion (bitch move), and expecting you to drop everything...

9qpvt6,"If you're fourteen, the number of hours you can work during the school year is pretty limited according to the law in most states, so your supervisor really can't fault you for that unless they're willing to break that law.

That said, even if you were a legal adult, having specific availability for part-time work doesn't make you an asshole. "
9qq0r9,"Not the asshole. When people fly on planes, they are fully responsible for managing any accommodations they might need. If you're a bigger person, you pay extra for either two seats or aisle seats, which you did. If you are a mother with a child, you pay extra for front row seats so that you have more room for the child. You don't expect everyone else on the plane to accommodate your shit. 

You paid for something, you were asked to give it up for the convenience of someone else who was not as responsible. Fuck that."
9qq5s7,"You were an asshole for not doing your job, leaving extra work on other people, and intentionally being slow so you didn't have to help anyone else.  It's straight up lazy to extend your busy work and skip over doing parts of your job. It's better to vacuum lightly than do nothing at all while expecting to be paid.  Ask for help if you need tips to speed up your cleaning, but don't cut corners by just not doing your job because you don't feel like it."

9qrmvl,"YTA.

First off, the roommate is doing you a massive favor, you should be thankful you aren't on the hook for more of it.

Second, it was a dumb decision to buy a washer/dryer you were never going to take with you. That's on you.

Third, it's extremely extremely normal to pay rent on a monthly basis, not a daily one. You're leaving him in a lurch by moving out mid-month. It's not fair for him to have to suddenly have to put up more rent before he finds a new roommate.

The reason you think it's crazy to pay 1300 dollars for 21 days is because it is! But that's because it's crazy to move in and out in 21 days AND pay for applicances! Again, that's on you.

The only thing you have going for is the security deposit. You should arrange with your roommate to require whoever takes your place to pay you $500 in return for your share of deposit upon move out. If he's not getting another roommate, for convenience sake you can offer to have him buy you out so he doesn't have to track you down when he moves out.

9qsoo5,"NTA, just enjoying the karmic fireworks. "
9qsowa,"Whew boy, there's a lot to unpack here. I'd generally say that the action you took was NTA, but I'm conflicted because the intent behind it was def a little asshole. If you were just friends still, separate other baggage, I'd honestly say you were less asshole-ish for dropping a dime on your bestie than when it's done for revenge - tho admittedly in that scenario you certainly would be a terrible friend to an equally shitty person but friendship imho does not entail doing things/keeping things quiet that you think are wrong. Besides that, any obligation you had to keep her secrets ended when your friendship did, tho seeking out the third party with the juicy deets in question is pretty borderline, said third party was actively being wrongef by your former-friend tbf.

Overall, I kinda want to wave a hand at this whole situation and say 'play bitch games, get bitch prizes', and call it a day. Your were hesitantly abetting something you thought was wrong *while* you were friends, and once that barrier was gone you took your chance to stop doing so. What makes me give you side-eye is that it was ok/not objected to *before* this bitch went nuts, if you thought it was so wrong of her to do. Generally tho, NTA, you just picked a shitty friend."

Without meaning to, you've kind of done that thing that kids do about sleepovers, and set her up to be the bad guy with your cousin of she says no ""Hey so I've said this person can stay at our house if you say yes, he's in a really shitty situation, can I tell him you're a decent human being that agreed to do this or not?""

So she's said yes, your cousin has thought he's out of the shitty situation and they're both in an awkward place now. There's no take backs on this, just take it as a lesson in timing and move on. Don't pressure your partner to change her mind, that would be a really bad idea. "

You are 100% NOT out of line for asking for gas money. If she was any type of good friend or person she would have already offered. 

And I'm just realizing, you said ""classmate."" So, she's not even like your buddy or best friend just someone who literally goes to the same location as you.

I'd say you're an asshole if you were using it to get special privileges but you were just trying to defuse the situation and apologizing irl and passed it to someone who could help better.

9qx2wn,"Dude you need to stop doing so much thinking and start communicating. I’m personally not a huge believer in this, but many people will be quick to tell you, sex and intimacy are vital parts of a relationship. You’re NTA for wanting to feel wanted. 

YATA, however, for not communicating this clearly with your partner and letting yourself overthink to a point where it feels like you might’ve fell out of touch with what your partner actually thinks about this matter. From the looks of it, it seems like they’re not big on the whole sex thing, meaning they don’t particularly enjoy it or they’re just lazy about it (real thing I’ve encountered lol). It’s fine for people to have that. And if that’s a dealbreaker for you, that’s also fine. But communicate with your partner first before making any conclusions - and it seems like you’re on the verge of making several. 

Something along the lines of “Babe, sometimes during sex/our more intimate moments, I feel like you’re not into it as much as I am.” and she’ll ask what you mean, and maybe you can tell her a few of the things you notice that indicate that she’s not into it the same way you are (a few; don’t go overboard). (If I’m completely wrong about this approach, someone better call me out on it btw lol.) It’s gonna be an awkward conversation sure, but you gotta be this direct with your SO. From there, ask if there’s anything you can do better, anything she’s particularly into that y’all haven’t talked about prior, what she enjoys and doesn’t enjoy etc. A healthy sex life must have good communication.

Lastly, and this is just a nitpick of mine lol: stop worrying about gender roles and masculinity and all that social construct bullcrap. That was the main indicator to me that you took this thought process way past its original stopping point. Sexual encounters and how they’re initiated are something that’s between you and your partner, not society or stigma. And I’m sorry if I got too harsh on you, I’m also just realizing that you’re probably really new to the whole sex and dating scene. Best of luck sorting this out."
9qx4tn,"You're the asshole. Huge asshole.

Holy shit, how can you mess up this bad.

> I told my sister to email them

You don't tell her how to run her business.

> I said she would get in touch by tomorrow.

You don't make promises to her potential clients on her behalf. Again, her business. Not yours. Why are you adding liability to her work?

> I texted my sister the company’s email, and said don’t over charge (a habit she has)

I assume you're not her financier. Not only is this inappropriate, it's likely highly insulting given graphic artists are notoriously underpaid  and frequently hassled to do pro bono work.

> I told my friends boyfriend not to email her.

Okay. So you got butthurt and screwed her over. Congratulations asshole.

> She kept telling me I was wrong and “that’s not how things work in the real world”.

She's right. You've recommended she change her fee schedule, take on jobs that may be inappropriate for her portfolio, added liability to her company, insulted her, and then blacklisted her to a potential client. With family like you, who needs enemies?"
9qx5fv,Definitely NTA. She’s not holding up her end of the bargain. 
9qx5qd,"You are the asshole.

Obviously how you could have better handled the situation is to not just assume that someone else's property is yours to do what you like.  Honestly, it's not about money (though I hope that $40 stung you a bit), it's about the principle of the matter.  This guy put a lot of effort into this party, including going some place where he could buy a some amazing helium balloons to make the party more festive and special.  You have no idea what he had in mind to do with those big balloons -- maybe it was photographs, maybe he was going to give them away,  whatever.  You, with absolutely no regard to all the effort and expense he went to, decided whatever amused you in the moment was more important.  

That's just shitty behavior.  And for what?  So you could inhale some helium and make your voice sound weird?

So that's my advice.  In the future, when you get invited to someone's house for a party, you treat their stuff with respect.  That includes the party decorations.  And if you don't want to be left out of the fun in the future, be a guest someone wouldn't mind inviting over again."

If it’s “””just money”””, he could’ve used his own to back his financial shit. I have half a mind to think you could do some legal action against him considering he deadass stole your money and then lied about it.

If the above is true, you're both assholes.  (i.e. **Everyone sucks**).  Don't get me wrong, he's the much bigger asshole for doing this kind of thing.  I don't even think you should have had to make it clear you don't like it the first time.  That is not something a married man with any respect for his wife considers doing unless they have some kind of understanding about it being an open marriage.  The fact that he does it, and hides, and it's happened before is a far greater transgression than snooping, but snooping is still a violation of some level in a marriage.  All in all, you don't get a total pass, but you can definitely feel free to laugh in his face if you accuse him of what you've seen there and he tries to make the argument about trusting you with his privacy.

9r6zcr,"Sorry this response got long:

I won't lie and say that I'm not being a little selfish in not wanting to help her anymore. But I have personally never been in a position where I could financially support her. I worked at a gas station up until my back surgery last year making below $9/hr, but even on that salary managed to help bail her out when she was arrested. I'm not a perfect person with a limitless threshold for what I'll put up with, but I help when and where I'm able. But I'm also done letting her get away with how she's acting since she doesnt seem to take any of this seriously. 

The relationship between her and her boyfriend is like a rollercoaster. They're broken up and hate each other one minute and then can't live without each other the next. During one of these ""hate each other"" moments, she refused him sex and he got angry and had a friend call CPS on her and they took my nephew away to live with the boyfriend's estranged mother in another state. My sister does not have custody of her child and the judge gave her an ultimatum: get off the drugs, get a job, get reliable transportation, and get her own place to live. That was back in March. She has done exactly none of that. She will get a job and quit it two weeks later. She's still on drugs. She's shown to us that she has no intention of changing her lifestyle.

My nephew on the other hand is doing much better where he is. He's talking now where he wasn't before, he's got his own room, he doesnt have to worry about how and if he's gonna eat that night... I love my nephew and I'm happy to see him where he's obviously being taken care of properly."

9r7wnw,"NTA. Having 4 german Shepards as a sole person is ridiculous, are they well taken care of? Germans need excellent training, a lot of exercise, and they can have common intense medical issues . Does she have pet insurance? Hip dysplasia will destroy her wallet.

You are Probably right in saying that she needs to get rid of them. I would tell her to find a rescue or find great homes for them. A household with 5 dogs is pretty tough unless you own a lot of property - an apartment does not have that - and 4 Germans will cost more, require more time, and it's just impractical.

I would tell her to seriously have a conversation with herself. Does she want 4 Germans in an apartment? How much attention will they receive, can she walk them all and exercise them for 2 hours minimum everyday? Can she pay for vet bills for 4 dogs that are prone to hip dysplasia? Is she willing to pay around 200-250 in pet insurance each month? Giving the dogs what's best is what needs to happen, and I doubt having her go to Germany with you will give them a better life. 

It's literally you or the dogs. I'd wager that they're not getting what they need already though. I'm sure she loves them, but if she wants to be with you they, or 3/4 of them should be rehomed.

You can't have it both ways."
9rasu3,"Fucking murderer, who gives a shit if he has a good heart. Action speaks louder than words. He killed a fucking person. No excuse for drunk driving. It's on the news every day. It's taught in schools, it's part of popculture and society's rules. Getting drunk into a car is like giving the middle finger to our society. It's like leaving someone to die. I would never ever talk to him again."

9rbfvm,"You're the asshole here, I'm afraid. 

Yes, it would have been nice if your friend had been able to reschedule the concert, but that might not have been possible.  For instance, the beerfest was likely on a specific day, and so your band would have to either be there on that day, or not play at all.  It sucks that it coincided with your return trip from the wedding, but small bands usually can't afford to pass up opportunities like this.  Plus, cancelling a concert after committing to it is extremely unprofessional and reflects poorly on the band.

Additionally, it's hard to tell from your post, but it sounds like you knew about the wedding beforehand, but booked your flight *after* the concert date was set.  At that point, *you're* the one making the decisions to snag a cheaper flight in exchange for not being able to be at the concert.  You can't expect the rest of the band to just cancel a concert because *you* wanted to save some money on plane tickets.  That's extremely selfish on your part.  

Yet the frontman took it all in stride, accepted that you wouldn't be there, and found the best alternative that didn't screw over the rest of your bandmates.  But you couldn't tolerate that, either.  You had to have everything your way, with no room to compromise, and no regard for others.

So in summary, you chose to flake on a concert to save a few bucks on some plane tickets, rebuffed a perfectly good proposal by the frontman to accommodate your selfishness while still honoring the band's commitments, and then threw a tantrum like some sort of prima donna when you didn't get your way.

You're an asshole."
9rbg8e,"NTA. Some people are so entitled they think they can do whatever they want, and have no regard for others or common courtesy for others. I think you did the right thing."
9rbjdi,"Not the asshole...

But it puts you in a tricky situation. I'm not sure what kind of job you can sleep the morning away in your car, but if it is legitimately an option then be honest with your boss. You do your work so you can go home on time. If Steve wants to do his work during the day and get help then, fantastic. If he wants to nap he gets to stay later. It's not your responsibility to cover for him. I'd be open and honest with your boss and do as little ""blaming"" as possible. Offer to help teach Steve how to manage better during the day so you can both leave on time and then document any times hes sleeping or slacking going forward. Not to tattle mind, just to CYA, and your boss can address any behavior issues that need to be corrected. That's why they pay him the bug bucks.

9rbjus,"He's an asshole for starting things and then stopping them like that. I don't care what the other commenters go on with ""you can't force him to have sex."" Yeah, no shit. But some guys probably know what it's like to be in that position and get shut down and end up with blue balls. Same thing for women. People need to stop acting like he doesn't know where making out leads when you two were dating for two fuckin years. Lol. Christ.

I'm not saying it's okay to force someone to have sex, that's not okay. 

But your boyfriend was being a huge douche. He knew what the fuck he was starting. And he just turned you down and gave you absolutely no reason, and refused to COMMUNICATE. 

You're an asshole for being passive aggressive and ignoring him. He's an asshole for never communicating what his issue was.

9rbzah,"Not the asshole, but you *would* be if you jumped right to refusing to let him use the TV without even having a basic conversation first. You've got every right to be upset, but not using your words will create needless tension with your roommate and make your living situation miserable.

9rcb36,"Not the asshole.

You're friend is being unreasonable. ""A"" doesn't want to go if the other two aren't going. ""A"" is allowed to do whatever they want, going or staying.

Anyway, I'm going to give more reason and explain.

Not the asshole. Why? Who the fuck bangs on a random person's door at 9am in the morning? That is rude as fuck. 

It's not her house. She doesn't live there. She's got no claim to anything. No right to bang on your door or bother the shit out of you. 

I don't think ""fuck off,"" was rude at all. I would have said pretty much the same. 

I think it's far more rude to bang on someone's door in the morning when it's closed, a good sign they are IN BED, than telling someone who bangs on your door at 9am to ""fuck off."" 

I don't think that is an asshole thing to do. I think banging on someone's closed door at 9am is an asshole thing to do.

And your roommate, he needs to stop suckling the teet. That shit was rude of his mom. And it's not like you knew who the hell was rudely banging on your door. "

9rk9fq,"NTA but kind of. I just think you could word it better. I have the same type of thoughts and I told my girlfriend when we had this conversation. She’s scared of gaining weight when she’s older so she’s aware of it and shares her weight with me. So I just said I’d love her at any weight and if she ever got to a point where she felt fat or gaining weight that I’d love for us both to go on a diet together and we could change some activities and do them together. that it wouldn’t be the end of the world/it is solvable. 

I forgot where I read it but women who feel that their partner appreciates and loves them regardless of their weight while they are trying to lose it actually follow through better with their weight loss goals than those with pressure to lose it. I think it’s better to just plant the seed that you are willing to be part of the solution if weight issues are to happen. That’s just being a good friend and partner. 

I’d try to make light of it. I tell her it’d be fixable to lift some anxiety and tell her you can’t fix ugly but you can fix fat, and I’d rather her be the latter "

You’re really young. You won’t understand what your mom is intending until later on. From what I’m hearing, she has good intentions and just wants you to do well in school and in the real world. There just seems to be very little communication and expression of emotions. Maybe try communicating with her that she’s being too pushy and it’s negatively effecting you. It just sounds like she wants some sort of control in getting you to be a successful student/person but she can’t really control that in the first place. You gotta live your own life and she has to understand that."

9rshf4,Not the asshole.  Just because you have access to car doesn't mean that you are obligated to play uber driver for your friends that don't.

9rv14v,"Gonna go with NTA on this one. I understand where your boyfriend is coming from, and you could have been a little nicer, but ultimately you're right. Apparently, you have been providing for both of you and must be exhausted constantly in order to help him out while he is out of a job.

I don't know why he is turning down jobs, but it's obviously hard for you to have to pay for everything yourself. Him saying, ""I feel like you aren't in this all the way"" therefore is a completely unjustified accusation, since you have been making sacrifices to keep you both afloat.

I know the job market is tough, and I also understand wanting to wait for the right position, but couldn't he also work part-time to help you out a little? Since I don't know what exactly his situation is, though, I don't wanna make any assumptions."

9rwi9d,"NTA. You said you’ve tried to be in contact with them over the months. Sounds more like they’ve already cut you off, so saying you’re cutting them off may just be semantics.

9rx9eo,"Not the asshole.  Calling you ""just a hole to fuck"" strongly suggests he has a disconnect on realizing that he's interacting with real people.  You wouldn't be hurting his girlfriend, his actions are.  He sounds very abusive and your concern for her is real.  

For your own safety I wouldn't see or tell this guy anything ever again.  You won the mega asshole lotto when you drew his number."
9rxf5i,"YTA and this is creepy. I really hope you’ve matured and understand how completely inappropriate this was. 

A) You can’t say that you love someone enough to marry them when you don’t know them well, aren’t good friends with them, and haven’t dated them. 

B) She may have been leading you on a little, but you hit obsession. In middle/high school you might be able to get away with this. Not when you’re older. My guess is that there was more to this story, and with details it would read a lot more like stalking. 

C) If someone isn’t interested there is nothing you can do to change that. Don’t chase after them forever. "
9rxhgk,"Not the asshole. It seems like the situation is going to escalate no matter what, and regardless of what you choose to do, your main goal seems to be helping the mental health of your brother. I’m not sure that giving him back his stuff will help the situation, since the confrontation will happen regardless. However, there’s nothing wrong (in my view) with giving him a heads up and maybe some support as his older sibling.

It’s a tough situation.

The nude pictures are especially concerning because possession of underage pics could result in child pornography charges in the US, even if both people are underage and consent was given."
9rxuir,"Yta. 

You will always be an asshole for cheating in a relationship unless it has been discussed between all partners that someone wants to sleep with someone else. You could just as easily mentioned hey , you don't like sex that's fine, can I sleep with someone else but for a sexual aspect.  
Buuuut you didn't. 

That's not to say that you are necessarily the only asshole in this situation when you cheat, but bottom line is you are still an asshole for doing it.

9rzivc,"no, you were completely honest in your feelings without trying to hurt him. instead of leading him on, you allowed him to just deal with it. it's hard but it's the better choice in the long run"
9rzy6d,"NTA because it's perfectly fine for you to have hobbies. Sometimes those hobbies conflict with other things.

That said, I think seeing each other, what, like <10 days? a month is very low compared to most couples. If my SO said that felt like a lot of time to be around me, I'd be kind of crushed. You're practically in a LDR and if your gf is upset, it could be because it seems like you're more content spending less time with her than she is with you.

I don't fault you at all for wanting to participate in this event and you're right, it makes no sense for her to make that drive just to feel neglected. I just think, if you want the relationship to last, you realllly got to make sure you tell/show your gf how much you appreciate her making those drives and how much they mean to you. Though, if you don't appreciate the frequency, that's something you're going to have to face eventually, too."

9s0ztl,"YTA for the **reason** you told her father. If it came out of a genuine place of care and concern, no - but you divulged it as an act of petty revenge. No doubt that what she did was awful but that doesn't justify what you did imo. "
9s235x,NTA You are two grown consenting adults. I don't see where the drama is.  Actually I find her behaviour and sense of betrayal really odd.
9s24wi,"Oof. Maybe the reason it's the 'first time you've heard anything of it' is because you haven't spoken with the musician in what, months? And then after this confrontation your decision is just to never speak to them again? *What?*

Though she's been financially supporting you for a long time now, the one conversation you have with the sister is to half-dangle the tax return at her. If you offer money while explaining how you need to keep it to survive, that doesn't count as an offer. The one talk you have with your best friend, they heavily imply they have a lot going on, and you apparently just leave it at that.

YTA. I feel you've missed out a chunk of context, but with what you've written here, you seem to have treated the musician like a fundraiser, the sister like a bank and the best friend like a stranger."
9s253w,"Woah. Initially from the title, I thought you were the asshole, but after reading the context to it and finding out how she reacted, you are definitely not the asshole. "
9s2spi,"60/40, YTA. He was absolutely an asshole; you fought fire with fire. The reaction people would have to his posting child porn, sans context, should not have surprised you. The consequences for him being more severe than you anticipated is a consequence you'll have to live with."
9s396i,"YTA mostly for the final paragraph. You did a thing that upset her, a thing that you promised not to do again, because you knew it upset her. She has continued to be sufficiently upset that she hasn't talked to you for a few days, and that's enough for you to feel absolved of your guilt, and feel overly stretched by the effort of texting her a few times? Yikes. Imagine how short your friendship would have been if she had as short a tolerance as you."
9s3xp0,"Yes you are the asshole. They comment that she has lied to make you feel better before is a big red flag to me. You still have time to fix this! You need to go to your daughter and first apologize and tell her how much she means to you. Then make a plan to do something special with her, even if you hate it. To not treat your children equally builds resentment, and the child that gets treated less than the other will have a lower self worth. If this is a one time thing that this has happened, we all screw up. But if you consistently do this you need to take a good look at yourself. "
9s4g9o,"Honestly, I don't think there are any assholes here.  You guys just have a different understanding of how casual things were going to be.  It's not out of line to invite people along to a casual group hangout in a public place.  It would be out of line to invite someone to an intimate group hangout.

"
9s4jmd,"You like what you like. NTA for not wanting to date someone you're not attracted to. Theres a difference between not being attracted to someone because of their weight and actively hating on someone because of their weight. 

So no you aren't the asshole. "
9s4o1b,"It’s his room as well. He should also be able to use it to do the things he wants. Maybe he doesn’t like going to the gym cause he’s self conscious. Maybe just ask if he could do it when you aren’t around. Au pire, it’s 20-25 mins out of a 24 hour day. Get over it. "
9s53p7,"NTA at all. Your sister is a gigantic asshole on several levels.

1) She's in her mid thirties and she still calls her mommy to sort out her problems? WTF? She has your phone number and doesnt need to involve your mother in this.

2) Which brings me to number two. Your mom just lost her TWIN SISTER and all your bratty entitled sister could think of is herself? Your mom should be left to deal with the grief of suddenly losing her sister, but now has to worry about organising a baby sitter for your sister. And then your sister goes and exhausts some more emotional labour from your mom by crying to her that life isnt fair because everyone isnt bending over backwards to look after HER kids.

3) She expects you to drop your work so that she wont have to. Fuck that noise. I'm assuming she's also not willing to cover the rent money you'll be losing out on?

4) She decided to pop kids into the world, not you. Not your damn problem. Sure it would be nice if you had the time to watch the kids, but it would be a favour and not a god damn responsibility.  I'm also assuming the kids aren't triplets? They cant afford daycare for the kids but they decide to pop out some more because it's not their problem right? Tell her Eric should have pulled out if daycare is so expensive.

Honestly she sounds like an entitled brat who needs a reality check. 

"
9s5c7m,"Dealing with a hoarder is super hard. My roommate is one and I basically wait to clean until he's gone and I throw out a lot of shit. I make sure to take it to the dump so he can't go through the garbage and take stuff out, he has in the past.

It sounds like your Mother doesn't do a whole lot and I honestly do feel like she is an asshole. But that doesn't mean that both of you can't be the asshole.

I noticed that you focused a lot on her income. Which is really none of your buisness. I don't like that. You have, what? Five people living there? Even the $1200/month just for that one check doesn't go that far. And your older sibling and his girlfriend *should* pay rent. That's how the adult world works.

I make about 2k/month and after bills, groceries, utilities, cell phone bills, car insurance, gas for my car, whatever, I'm lucky if I got $100 to my name at the end of the day. And that's in a two person house hold. So I can't imagine that what it's like having to take care of a house hold with 5 people, several which are still young like that.

You live at your Mother's house, so if you don't like it, then move. It's as simple as that. And if you are too young to do that, then deal with it and start saving up so when you are old enough to do so you can move out. 

Both assholes, but you're less of one than she is."
9s5d5q,"NTA.  You should never feel like you have to remain in a situation where you're being made to feel uncomfortable, and any decent friend would respect that. "
9s5ll0,Nope. I'm surprised you went back and argued about it. 
9s5oc6,"If I threw up on someone’s shoes I’d offer to pay the entire price of the shoe, especially since I’d be the one throwing up on them. He should think himself lucky you’re not expecting the whole price. NTA "
9s701k,"NTA. People need to learn to not mess with other people's clothes and to be ready for payback if they do. People messing with clothes is usually why I stayed with something to do so no one could slyly take out my clothes. 

Do you think it actually took 2 hours for towels to dry? Or do you think others had been taking out your stuff then putting it back damp when they were done. Sounds like crappy dryers tbh. I'm still curious though."
9s7rdm,"NTA. The only thing I could say about your comment is that it might come off as lecture-y (plus you’re a bit older than her, so she might think you’re acting like you know better because of your age). That’s a huge reach though, I don’t see anything wrong with what you said. "
9s85xg,"NTA for the same reasons the other commenter said. What a tricky situation, I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. You’ve detailed everything pretty perfectly though. 

I’d first recommend talking to your friend group and making sure they know that this isn’t how you expected this to go, and that the classmate invited his friends without your knowledge. They might even give you advice on how to either better incorporate said classmate or distance themselves from him and his group. 

I’d then recommend talking to the classmate one-on-one sometime, and maaaaybe letting him know that you didn’t expect his friends to join y’all and you’re worried that the groups don’t vibe as well as they think they do. If you choose to pursue this conversation - and I entirely understand if you wouldn’t wanna pursue this - you’re gonna have to walk on some eggshells for the length of it. And hopefully they’re not socially inept AND toxic, because that gives way to rumors and/or bad behavior on their part if they choose to take this news negatively. Maybe you can try helping him recognize some of the things he does that aren’t totally socially accepted. 

When I was in the 8th grade, someone deadass told me “TheExarion, you’re annoying and here’s why.” and while I was hurt by this at first, it definitely helped me change for the better. I picked up on social cues a lot better, I became more aware of how I’d be perceived by others based on what I do, I learned how to talk to others (for the most part lol) so as to not be overbearing or obnoxious, etc. Sometimes the hard talk is the best talk. Don’t overwhelm the classmate with all the ways he could change/what y’all’s stance is on his friend group, but just guide him & give a few pointers. Let him know what you think of him (nice, genuine, a friend) and that you mean well for him. If you choose to go there, that is. Best of luck!"
9s8ddz,"It is not selfish, all relationships must have their limits. Tell him it isn’t because you distrust him, but because it is too intrusive. Like I love my mother but don’t want her to live in my house.

9s8ehg,"NTA 

A job is a job, and even people accused of a heinous crime should not be the victim of vigilante justice. 

Having said that there’s a lot of fucking things that could go wrong with this arrangement and I would advise against it -just be a bouncer or deliver pizzas or something"
9s94up,"NTA. Accusing people of sexual assault when they haven't done anything is so fucking wrong and it happens way too often. 

I know you've stated that she admits to her lies the next day but it seems really weird to me that instead of contacting the police after these ""events"" occur she contacts her friends, plus doesn't go to a hospital so she can actually prove that she was raped"
9s99k6,NTA. you're protecting your boss and your job. But what's stopping them from taking food from the garbage and suing you guys?
9s9j7h,"NTA. You pay for your car, you pay the insurance. Your name is in the title. It was kind of you to let her borrow it, but she took advantage and needs to be reminded that it isn’t her car. As for your parents, I think you need to let them know as well."
9sb9lo,"Given the context, yes, YWBTA. Two weeks is in no way no necessarily enough time for them to find a decent roommate without being screwed financially. I don't think the excuse of ""it seems like they are avoiding me"" warrants breaking the lease, leaving your roommates high and dry, and basically ruining your friendship with these people.

You need to begin with a frank, open conversation about how you feel and go from there. If you still don't want to stay, then find a roommate to take your place first and then leave.

EDIT: sp. "
9sbo81,"NTA, your boyfriend should work on his trust-issues."
9sbxnk,"No. NTA He literally tried to replace you in your circle of friends and tell you you weren't invited to an event you thought of and invited others to. It was very rude, and invasive of someone that barely goes there. Who was he to say who can or couldn't go? The transfer is a bit dramatic, he could have still attended classes and made new friends. He sounds like he would have been a pansy filled drama queen anyway, so you probably shouldn't feel too bad. What a jerk! "
9sbypw,YTA.  They're family.  And getting a present for one nephew and not the other?  That's rough.
9scefc,"Well kinda. Not a Major asshole, but if you already had too many people why the hell did you reach out to her again? Also one person wont make a huge difference over the whole thing so i’d say call her back and say “Hey listen i thought about it and I originally said no because i kinda invited too many people, but I’d really like you to come anyways so by all means yes. Bring your friend. “

Now you are scoring EXTRA points!"

9sg1fp,"Not the asshole.  You don't really think for a second that you are, do you?  T wants you to stay quiet so a serial rapist can go out and victimize more women?  You haven't done anything bad to T.  He's facing consequences for his own shitty actions.  This is a good thing.

You're not an asshole at all, T is a weapons grade asshole, and M is also and by trying to get you to drop this he's trying to be an accessory to the future rapes T will likely commit.
"
9sg43b,"If he told you that she's just some chick he fucks then he can't really be upset. If he literally said ""pump and dump,"" well your friend is a douche and you shouldn't feel bad.

It it sounds like your best friend treats women like shit. You might want to look for new friends. ""Pump and dump?"" The fuck, you guys frat douche bags or something? Wow.

Not the asshole as far as fucking this girl and not telling your friend. Your friend never gave a fuck about her to begin with."

9si4u5,"NTA. That’s kind of a weird thing to do, just try and move Halloween locally. If it’s a really big thing, you might want to, just because you might miss most of the kids, but I don’t think you’re an asshole either way."
9siep8,"The friend is the asshole but I think you mishandled it. You probably should’ve talked to your wife about it and then approached the friend more respectfully and calmly. I think that you know that a person like the friend wouldn’t respond well to you calling them out so bluntly like that, you probably should’ve taken a calmer more thought out approach. kudos to you though, common problem, super annoying and really hard to deal with. Best of luck."
9sje86,"I don’t think you’re an asshole for being disappointed, but I do think you’re being an asshole for throwing a tantrum and expecting an apology. Your SO doesn’t owe you sex, and wasn’t “leading you on” by expressing interest. It’s likely that your SO was interested at the time, and then changed their mind, which is totally a normal thing and not something they need to apologize for, especially when you “sulked excessively” about not getting laid. "
9sjkoj,"Youre not an asshole, but maybe you can be more sympathetic. He has to get up crazy early to get ready for work, and what you have an issue with is something he cant control, and shouldnt have to. Get some earplugs, or ear buds to dampen the sound. I'm also a super light sleeper too, and it's what I had to resort to, to get good sleep with all the noises in my house. "
9sjlvw,"You and the girl are both assholes.

You and her both knew your friend liked her. You and her both know your friend still likes her. You're both being assholes by being inconsiderate and continuing to pursue a relationship together. She might be the one chasing, but you aren't doing anything to stop her - you're leading her on, despite seeing the emotional damage it's causing to your friend & roommate.

&#x200B;

Life Pro Tip:

Don't ditch your friends for a relationship, especially for a girl like that. From what you've told, she seems she just wants attention from guys she finds attractive.

Realistically, even if she doesn't find a new love interest at her school and you two hit it off, how long do you think the relationship will last? A few weeks/months? Maybe a couple years at most, but surely you two won't be together indefinitely. And who's going to be there for you when you and your girl are broken up and you're down & out? Your friends. Not your ex girlfriend. Your friendship with your roommate will outlast the relationship with the girl. Women aren't worth losing a good friend.

&#x200B;

edit: 

I love how OP blatantly says:

>TL;DR: I low-key stole my roommates girl over FaceTime.

Yet, OP is debating whether he's in the wrong, and people are justifying it. No wonder this world is getting so fucked with each passing generation. Morals are FUBAR"
9sjwiw,"hell no, fuck that kid. i understand where you think words would have done more justice than anything physical, but maybe if you caught him in the act of actually grabbing it, a “what the fuck, man?” probably would have been the better option. however, slamming him in the moment when you had your adrenaline rushing because you probably had a million “what if’s” going through your head when all you really wanted was to just make sure he didn’t get away with it, seems totally appropriate. "
9sjz3f,"Yeah. Your friend is showing genuine concern. I get reacting in that way, but it sounds like they are just looking out for you. Which is what a good friend is supposed to do."
9skc98,"YTA.  You treated your friend like an object, and ever refer to her as a ""target"" and this ""productive session"" as ""target practice"".  WTF is wrong with you?  Your friend is a real person with feelings.  You should be treating your friends with compassion and respect, not calling them ""targets"" and using them as some sort of stand-in to practice dating behavior that they didn't consent to or even know was happening.

I seriously hope you're, like, 14 or something, so that you still have time to grow up and learn how to treat people."
9skqgx,NTA.  Why is he still there?  You have enabled him.  It's your house.
9sksq1,"Sometimes, you need a breather. I've had my share of times where I just wanted to shut myself out of the world and have some time to myself. There's nothing wrong with that - if you feel you need it, by all means, take the occasional day or two for yourself.  And at the same time, it seems as though you have a tight-knit group that has your back. They genuinely care about you, and they certainly don't want to exclude you from the fun that they're having. 

You mentioned bad grades and general laziness as part of the reason for your ""life going to shit"". Both of these components are things that you can fix if they're as bad as you say they are. There's no problem with letting your friends know that you might have to break plans in an effort to improve grades. Being vulnerable to your friends about the situation you're in can be a tough thing to do, but it does lead towards better relationships with the people you care about. You're human, and that's okay.

At the end of the day, please don't feel like you aren't worthy of a helping hand. Don't feel like you're any less of a human being because of the way you're feeling. Do what you have to to live the best life you can. And don't feel like you're a terrible person to reach out to your friends - they care about you as much as you care about them.

Good luck, OP. "
9skvvw,"Not the asshole.  You started the idea with him, true, but it sounds like you're both having some serious creative differences.  The fact that you've drawn inspiration from him in the past doesn't bind you in the present or the future.   He hasn't contributed anything to this project in the past five years while you have, you're in the clear to bring it to completion without his involvement. "
9slgki,Gosh no you're not the asshole. He's the asshole for foisting a dog upon you when you couldn't afford one. 
9slkka,Nope. She is though for cheating on her boyfriend.
9sm7zg,"No, you are being realistic and sensible. I got a dog on a spur of the moment whim and as much as I love him they are a huge commitment and expense. You can’t go anywhere either unless you take the dog with you or pay for kennels, my dog has chewed several pairs of shoes etc plus the unexpected vet bills if they get sick are ridiculous, not to mention the flea and worm treatment. They need walked 2/3 times a day. I would say she needs to reconsider, in hindsight I wish someone had told me not to get my dog when I did."
9smy0t,I don't think you're an asshole. Pretty good chance your family will have the opposite opinion though.
9snfqq,"There is misatribution.

You are misatributing your non-attendance to her boyfriend, even though it is her party for her birthday. 

Your father is misatributing your nonattendance to hurting your sister, not your stance on boyfriend. 

You are both at fault due to communication barrier. 

You should apologize to both father and sister, your father should apologize to you. 

Her boyfriend is an issue completely separate to birthday party. You almost never need to make such a strong gestures in modern society. Just sit down quietly, try to hurt as few feelings as possible and express your opinion in non-combatitive way."
9snvf2,"NTA. I would honestly cut them both off of contact indefinitely. Just because they are blood/related via marriage does not mean they deserve anything from you. They have proven time and again that they do nothing but hurt you and your son. 

It’s been six years since I have spoken with my abusive mother and my life has been much better because of it. You don’t need to keep that toxicity. "
9so2qy,"Ehhhh you're kinda the asshole, I totally understand that most people can't just take in a stray at random and get them help.  But in every city there's someone to call, even if it's just the cops lol.  A humane society would be a good place to start.  I've had to do that for a beagle that was lost and had clearly been out in the rain for days.  

If you see it again try and find someone to call, the cat might end up just being put down, but it's in pain poor guy.  :( "
9soskx,"Not the asshole. 

If he can't behave like an open minded adult and his girlfriend is an asshole then you have every right to straight up tell them they are not invited, or you know, simply not invite them. 

Sounds like you'd all be better off if your dad and his girlfriend didn't show up. 

If you don't want him or his girlfriend there that's your choice. It's your graduation. If your dad has an issue with it, tell him the truth. 

"
9sp0rv,"NTA at all. Don't feel bad about telling him no. You did offer to let him use your garage, but since it's yours, your projects obviously take priority."
9spwkb,"No. You guys voted, the answer was no, it’s no. 

He can’t legally assume responsibility for everything - if there’s drugs in the house and you live there, the cops can say you are involved.  

So, you made a rational decision based on your level of comfort. That’s good I think. You are not the asshole. "
9spxh7,[removed]
9sqm65,"Some advice I got is to try and say thank you when you want to say sorry. IE— “thanks for being so understanding and kind” instead of “sorry I’m such a burden”. It paints things in a more positive light. It takes practice but I think it would really improve your relationship. 

I don’t honk your an asshole but she has told you this bothers her and if you want to maintain this friendship you need to make an effort to stop. 

Also. It can’t be emotionally healthy to say sorry all the time and is definitely a sign of a deeper issue. Are you in therapy? "
9sqp5u,Not only do I think you’re justified I also think you did just fine in your apology. You’re definitely not the ass. You’re honestly way too nice here to be an ass.

I'm not one to celebrate birthdays, but I can see why she feels used and upset. If you didn't have sex, maybe it would have gone differently. Also, if you wanted to pursue this and knew that she likes to celebrate her birthday, you could have just set a reminder. Easy work around for your poor memory."

9stpt3,"Not the asshole, but Not-Not the asshole. 

Relationships are about supporting eachother through the hard times, and sounds like hes going through a hard time right now.

What you need to do is sit down and have a talk with him, tell him how bringing his stress home is affecting you, but you arent trying to shut him down or out, and that you understand his need to vent and de-stress.. and figure out how you can together deal with the work stress and relationship issues.

9su4ko,Polite racism is definitely a thing these days friend. People can be super nice to you while also assuming the worst about you. I find it really suspicious that she was fine with spending money on a costume that would have to be worn with a partner just until she learned who we were. 
9sum9o,"Nah, she was literally a choosing beggar just trying to mooch. Now, yeah you probably could have said it in a not-so-rude way, so maybe you're both assholes. "
9suro0,"NTA

Put it this way - what would you say to a teenage friend in the same situation? You’d reassure them that it’s ok to set boundaries around who they invite into their home, especially for special events. You might also say they did well at making sure their younger siblings were heard and respected. 

Relax, you’re good. "
9sv9jo,"Nta, but could’ve been handled better. I’ve had to tell my brother that if he ever touched my dog again he had to find a new place to live. But i never raised my voice. The screaming was a bit much in my opinion, especially if the dog wasn’t hurt. "
9svqg5,"YTA, did you ever consider the emotional impact this statement would have on the person you were talking to. Some topics can be avoided if you are capable of mustering up some empathy."
9svx2f,"No, YNTA, but I don’t think he is either. Guys tend to share about their relationships when they’re happy about them, and if the sex is good too, it’s possible that he’ll want to share that excitement with friends. This is sometimes done through bragging to them. He’s TA if he’s objectifying you in talking about your sex life, but if he’s just sharing excitement, then I don’t think he is.

If you share that you are uncomfortable with him talking about it and he continues to do so, then HTA."
9svx5v,"YTA for trying to control her behavior. Expressing discomfort and asking her to prioritize your relationship is normal, threatening her with a break to force her to cut all contact is manipulative.

That said, your concerns about her feelings are probably valid and you might want to take that break you threatened to really think about this relationship. You don't have to stay if you are unhappy or if she doesn't value her relationship with you."
9svxrc,"NTA, the title originally made it seem like the stereotypical jealous guy but in this case you’re really just a concerned friend who happened to be an Ex. "
9svz54,"NTA. You know what you like and if he can’t provide for you, even though you do it for him then move on. He’s kind of an asshole for getting upset with you. "
9svzdh,"NTA. She’s responsible for her transportation unless you agreed otherwise, which you didn’t. STA for being passive aggressive instead of talking about her feelings when it happened."
9sw1yg,"YTA but so is he. 6 is too damn early to be making loud noises. Yelling at a neighbor to shut the fuck up is pretty assholy too. Especially if you have never talked to him about it. 

Next Saturday if he's out working on his car, grab a couple beers, walk over, say sorry for yelling at him, hand him the beer, and ask him politely to start later on the weekends. If he keeps doing it, he's the asshole and you can make a noise complaint to the police. "
9sw3cr,NTA. Talking about your feelings isn’t the same as keeping your opinions on other men to yourself. 
9swcnp,"NTA, it is important to have boundaries with family, and it sounds like you are doing a pretty good job of staying connected. "
9swdm2,You found the pup a proper home. Good game m8 :) -wouldnt half hurt more people to be more like you in the scenario.
9swgdh,"NTA. If you had just kept it to yourself but kept distancing yourself from him or kept feeling disgusted at times when you were close to him, it would really take a toll on your relationship. If anything I think the two of you need to sit down and have an honest conversation where you both try to put aside your feelings and you both talk about this. 

Honestly, in some people's family, they really don't have the same standards of cleanliness or hygiene as others. So, them saying that he's clean to them might not be the same to you. Also, not everyone gets in the shower and really washes themselves or scrubs or whatever. Some people kind of stand under the spray and swipe a little bit with a soapy rag and that's it."
9swinq,"NTA, but sometimes it’s just not worth trying to reason with people who are so deeply set in their ways..."
9sx0c6,"NTA. Like you said, she lives a comfortable life. You are not obligated to give her an allowance when she does not need it. If she had fallen on hard times, that would be a different story, but you don’t have to financially support her just because she wants you to. "
9sx2xb,"I think you're right, but for the wrong reasons. 

Firstly, the science behind gender fluidity is murky at best, but at this point, indicators are that gender identity is formed by biological issues, or social influence. The former cause is what it is, but the latter, imo, can quite reasonably be attributed to mental instability, which is maybe better phrased as just the confusion and self-discovery that comes with being young, naive, and easily lead. 

Secondly, you are sadly right that transgender people are, generally speaking, more prone to mental instability than the general population. This isn't because they are inherently ill, but because of how absolutely brutal society is towards them, and how damaging the effects of that are long-term. There's a study on that [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5178031/), if you'd care to read. 

&#x200B;

On a final point, I'd like to close by saying that I don't think you're the asshole, because while your views don't align with the current liberal views (which are basically just the old conservative views of attacking anyone with a different viewpoint to your own, but transposed), you do have the self-awareness to question yourself, and your opinions of others. Imo, that's the seed from which true respect, understanding, and kindness is grown,  and it's from that which we learn to treat each other better, which in turn builds a better society. Progress down that ally, and the mental instability we talked about in the second paragraph which is brought on by society's ill treatment of transgenders starts to dissipate, just because of the decency you and people around you can show them. Tl;dr, you're not an asshole for noticing a trend or an issue, but you can be a good guy for doing your bit to resolve it. "
9sx31a,"YTA. Like you said, they're both adults and are clearly into it. Who are you to control their actions?"
9sx61p,"Not the asshole. We're not doing this. What the fuck.

Reading this entire post, I felt like I was in some sort of opposite day universe. I had to get on my laptop just so I could type faster. **OP, your ex-boyfriend tried to rape you, saw you bleeding and crying on the floor, undermined your suffering and tried to downplay his rape attempt, and for some fucking reason you not only forgave him, but there's somehow a shred in you that believes you might be the asshole here. Your boyfriend saw you at your lowest** ***which was ENTIRELY HIS FAULT*** **and told you you were being selfish.** Nope, we're not doing this. You need to be far the fuck away from this guy. He's extremely dangerous and needs to be rotting in jail. And your friend telling you to give him a second chance is **not** your friend. I don't know what they were thinking AT ALL, but your shitty ex-boyfriend does not need a second fucking chance.

And this goes for OP and anyone else that is in a situation even remotely similar to this: Please get the help you deserve. Go to therapy, seek out services for anxiety or depression or self-harm, get a professional opinion on what's going on in your life if your mental health is hindering you in any way, shape, or form. It can only do good for you. There are innumerable resources out there. **You deserve the help. You don’t deserve someone that abuses you telling you what to do.**

Edit: Just wanna add this in - No matter who it is, you are NOT obligated to sacrifice your body for ANYONE. You do not owe anyone sex or any physical favors. This goes for everyone. You are the owner of your body, you decide what gets to happen to it. No one else, not even your SO. "
9sxfhm,NTA. You aren't your mother's therapist. It's incredibly unfair for her to be putting all that emotional pressure on you as her child. 
9sxhjw,"NTA You don't need any more reason to break up with a person other than that that you've lost attraction. That's a very legitimate reason and you don't owe anyone to wait for the spark to come back especially if it's just dating with no kids involved.

If you want to get back with her it's up to you, though it might be a better post for r/relationship_advice"
9sxjw7,"They could have helped him as well. If they have time to scold you they definitely have the time to help him as well, you did what you could and you were only caring for the others, I get that you were his bunkmate therefore he is technically your responsibility, but you are a platoon so you help each other. Definitely NTA "
9sy2y5,"NTA.  Your wife sounds like she's struggling with mental health.  If she does indeed suffer from BPD, post-partum depression (PPD) may also be a factor here.  She needs help but only she can make that call.  Your job is to make sure your daughter is safe and healthy.  Based on what you wrote, I would not consider your wife in her current state to be able to deliver on either of those reliably.   

You're pretty self-aware of being a pushover.  You may want to consider individual therapy for yourself (and marriage counseling for both if conditions are right) so you can effect positive change.  "
9sy52q,"Yeah your an asshole, big time. 
You have no idea why she was upset and injected your opinion about her weight without being asked and without even knowing if that’s what she was upset about. 
Staring is also rude. 

You kicked someone when they were  
down. "
9sy6pp,"Of course you're not the asshole. That's actually very considerate and kind to schedule the text so your other doesn't worry. She doesn't need to know about it, as long as she's happy that you're safe. "
9sylpj,"It's possible that his variety of special needs makes the lines of acceptable social interaction blurry. In fact, that may be quite likely.

But really that's all the more reason to be *explicitly* clear. If you need to be cold (not cruel, that's different) to get your point across clearly, then do it. To elaborate, it's fine to say ""I am not and never will be interested in you like that"" or ""I do not want to be your friend"", even going as far to call his behaviour creepy (because it does come off that way from what you've said) is fine. As long as you're not insulting for the sole purpose of making the other person feel bad (even if you end up making them feel bad anyway), you're unlikely to do anything wrong."
9synu5,NTA sleep depravation makes us do crazy things some times. I don't know if this would work for you but what really helped me was falling asleep with headphones in playing music. It's noise but more relaxing less unexpected and disturbing than snoring. You can get comfy sleep headphones for not that much money these days. 
9syond,Yes YTA. Follow cultural norms in the country you’re visiting. 
9syopi,No. You took advantage of the situation that was presented to you that could benefit you.
9syp47,"You have the right to be frustrated. And a job is not a prison you can leave when you want, but they can also fire you for leaving. I would not have accepted all that either"
9syt81,"Yes, you're an asshole. They lost it, but it's still *not yours*.

There's no point explaining it in any depth because you've already said you don't feel bad about it and would do it again. If I'd lost that and it was returned to me, I'd be thankful I even had the stuff back at all, but since you did take something, it wouldn't stop me from thinking you're at least a little bit of an asshole, unless the money you took was explicitly to pay for the fees incurred while returning the items."
9syux0,"Yes you are. They are doing their job and every indescrepancy is a reason to bar someone from entering. 

You didn't update an 8 year old picture. Of course they will be suspicious, a lot changes in 8 years. And it would make sense that they think it wasn't you but your brother."
9syvya,"Like, NTA, I don't see the issue here?  The fact you e-mailed instead of called means nothing imho.  I'd rather get an e-mail than a call about something like this because it gives me time to reflect on what has been said.  I think you're overthinking this."
9syxqm,"If your best friend is constantly making things up it was probably a good idea to have him own up to it.

Rely on honesty and keep liars at arm's length.

Morals are born from social interaction. If he doesn't get that cheating is wrong, and he gets upset that you tried to bring some light to the situation, then he's selfish and probably narcissistic."
9szh87,"NTA, but you should probably stop eating the special food as much as possible and eat normal foid when it's feasible. It's a reasonable request. "
9szla1,"YTA. 

Don’t ask your boyfriend to rate you (even as ‘a joke’) if you are going to take the answer so seriously that you bring up the ‘wrong’ answer a month later. 

Edit: a month, not months. 

"
9szqnq,"NTA unless I've misunderstood something. He literally told you he couldn't afford to come any more, what were you meant to do, take the time off just in case? Like to me how you've written it, he cancelled on you. "
9szrye,NTA that's how you learn. Sounds like she's pretty defensive too. 
9szstd,NTA. You handled it well. I think she might like hanging out with this guy. Either that or she doesn't want to be tethered down completely relationship wise. Sorry bud.
9szvvz,"Give him a warning, “I’m hosting a movie night but I’m not having you over if you plan on monopolizing the convo with your critique.” Then it’ll be up to him if he wants to go. 

It’ll solve the issue of that night specifically and also tell him that, as a group, your comments were serious- he may want to reconsider his behavior if he wants to stay in the group. Totally fair!! "
9t053m,"NTA in my opinion. You didn’t lead her on and cut it at the earliest opportunity in a seemingly polite manner. She should know that her pictures are misleading, but maybe it’s harder for a person to tell how different they look when it’s themselves. I’d say neither of you are in the wrong."
9t0bln,"Both assholes. 

He should agree to move it out of the way because no one likes seeing broken junk growing moss on the same spot forever. 

Youre the asshole because the house has been messy for years, and just because you suddenly decided to tackle the clutter does not mean everyone else is suddenly going to care. 

Pick your battles. Keep tidying and cleaning up--let the newly cleaned areas and evolving improvement make the bike self evident for the useless eyesore it is. 

Once the house gets really clean, he'll probably be embarrassed over how out of place the bike is. "
9t0g0q,nta Well you told him by email how you felt and he just denied everything and insulted you. I don't know why he was expecting you to come to his wedding without apologising first 
9t0p5r,"Situations in where you stiff the waitstaff can be tough to call. It's very subjective where that line is.

ULTIMATELY, I think you were in the right here, so I'm gonna say:

**NTA**

If I'm reading this right:

- you order filet

- you get regular steak, *and eat it* (this was a bad move, I would have spoken up immediately to the chef)

- they deduct the surcharge from your bill for the filet (correct move), but do not remove charge for steak (well, you *did* eat it)

- they offer no further fixes, so you stiff on tip

Honestly, the restaurant did do a bad job here. They put very little effort into rectifying their error. I also would have requested money off the meal, or something to compensate for the error. Usually, you'd get it.

I probably would have done the same thing. 

*also fuck that guy who didn't speak up about getting the wrong food earlier*
"
9t1332,"NTA.

As said by others, the day before her birthday isn't her birthday. Just like the day before Mother's Day isn't Mother's Day. If getting back at 6am (and still theoretically having 18 hours to spend with her) isn't going to please her I'm not sure what you can do."
9t1969,"I'm going to say NTA

I mean it's only the second day you've known him and it's way out of your way. Either way he would have to wait an hour so I'm going to say your in the clear"
9t1bpu,"So she's under the impression you stood around and waited for her to empty the ground coffee container? I can see why she was annoyed by it, although she definitely shouldn't have cursed at you.

NTA. Co-worker seems a bit sensitive to me, but I guess why I can see why she came to that conclusion"
9t1jwa,"Yes. YTA. 

Dude, your sister isn't happy with your girlfriend, and you don't want her to date someone you don't like? Talk about double standards! 

You don't get to have it both ways. You need to apologise, and agree that neither of you talks about your SOs with each other. "
9t1n2q,"For me personally, doing something soft like shrooms or doing coke once is a nonissue. But for you, it’s an issue. You have the right to break up with him for whatever reason you want. If you don’t want to date someone who tries drugs then you can dump him. NTA. "
9t1qaz,"Both are assholes and you'd be an asshole if you drove like either of them.  

Their antics not only endangered their own lives, but the lives of everyone else on the road around them.  And for nothing.  Both the tailgater and the brake checker thought the most important thing to do at the time was to drive like an asshole to prove that they are right and the other person is wrong.

In my opinion, neither is mature enough to deserve to be on the road.  The mature thing to do is to not fucking road rage.  Have some patience.  Solve the problem.   Someone is tailgating you, switch lanes, let him go on and be someone else's problem.  Live another day without an expensive accident.  If you are tailgating someone else -- fucking don't.  Be patient. 
"
9t1v86,Obviously. It's his shirt. 
9t20aw,"Not an asshole for asking why he doesn't unfriend her.   You weren't even asking him to unfriend her, you were just asking why he didn't. He is an asshole for snapping at you.

Honestly, I'd put those thoughts of marriage on hold until you guys are on the same page about his ex.  He may not be hiding his relationship with her (such as it is), but he's definitely hiding his *reasons* for having a relationship with her."
9t281w,I believe you’re NTA. It’s their fault and they should’ve told you they had plans. You had the right to get mad at them.
9t2l1d,"I mean, I feel like YTA a bit here yeah. You said you'd do something, you took it back, you said you'd do something again, you took it back again (at the last possible moment). The actual thing itself is not a big deal. Buy some furniture, don't buy it, it's not exactly life altering. But I would be annoyed at you if you were my friend.  It wouldn't be a massive issue, just irritating. "
9t2mhm,Why don't you just be a grown-up and talk to him. 
9t2mj7,"YTA.

I've done EXACTLY what you've done to a teacher and that led to an avalanche of my classmates not giving a damn about him. She's competent at her job and you didn't NEED to speak up. A lot of the substitute teachers had a hard time getting any control of your class and she seems to have done so (to what extent, I'm not sure but the fact that you gave her credit on controlling the class means she's doing a decent job). Granted this argument is a slippery slope, you speaking sarcastically will give the sign to the other students that it's okay to backtalk and disrespect her. "
9t2nlg,I don't think you're the asshole. She should get some ear plugs if she wants to sleep all day.
9t2tan,NTA - that’s funny shit
9t2wz9,"NTA - if someone decided to celebrate Hanukkah or Ramadan or some holiday you don’t celebrate, that’s cool too. Everyone get to celebrate their preferred holidays"
9t2zj2,"YTA. Less so for it being your idea in the first place, mostly because you're aware of the discrepancy between your finances and hers but still tried anyways.

Post-edit edit: imo YTA for expecting her to help when you know moneys tight for her and it was your idea originally; I dont see how shes on the hook for financing your return from a trip you wanted to go on, especially since she already went half on the stuff during the drive."
9t37js,"Yes, yes you are.  You brought violence into a situation where it was not needed.  "
9t3f9c,"You're NTA for not wanting to play with someone that isn't good. YTA by the way you brought up that she's not an attention seeker or a tease, implying that is not normal for girls. Also, you wanted to help her originally because you thought it was cute, but now you're over it. Doesn't sound like your friends are over it, so can you really blame them for acting the same way you did?  And maybe try not censoring yourself at all. She's a human being, not a delicate flower. If she gets offended she can find another group to play with, which would also solve your problem. Most girls do not like being treated any differently than a dude in these situations. "
9t3n27,[deleted]
9t3t22,"NTA. Freedom of association. If you don't want to see someone, so be it, especially someone connected to so much trouble and pain for you. That kid didn't do anything to you, but at the same time, they are a constant reminder of your cheating ex. 

The kid isn't being hurt by you not being around, you have no responsibility to be around either. Tell your sister, and her friend, to take the crotch fruit and fuck off. "
9t3zsy,"I was ready to say YTA until I get to the end of your post. 

Totally NTA. A death in the family, especially one so horrible is for sure a legitimate reason to need to cancel. I’m very sorry for your loss. "
9t457z,"NTA, it’s college you can leave when you want"
9t467y,"Yep, and sorry about your privilege."
9t46ei,"NTA. You have no obligation to keep toxic people in your life. Sit them down and tell them why you don't want them in your life. Perhaps they don't realise how bad they are.

It may also make things more complicated with the rest of your friend circle."
9t4cqv,"Yeah, YTA. Did you also mention how when men are accused of sexual assault most of the news coverage is about ""how their whole life is ruined?"""
9t4u6g,"No, you aren't the asshole. If you lack faith in Christianity, you have no good reason to be a Christian. Your mother - whose response to your hypothetical should be read as ""I will break the law and commit what would constitute child neglect because you don't have the same arbitrary faith in this thing that I have"", is the asshole. Your father is too, insofar as he allows you to live in an environment where your faith is coerced with threats of child abuse. "
9t4y2u,"Yes you are being an asshole. Just talk to her about the cleaning situation. If you kick her out, you're going to fuck her over for a long time "
9t4zp9,"If you said it as you have written.... then no.

But it's a hard lesson to understand at 13. Especially if she is a young/childish 13. A few slightly rough real lielfe lessons like the one you described she will soon realise she has outgrown her childhood and is now in her teen years

"
9t56rn,"NTA.

Your child. Your rules. Sounds like the sister needs to sip on a tall glass of ""check yourself before you wreck yourself""

However, did you tell your husband about this? She seems to be super manipulative and this needs to be brought to his attention. If he doesn't listen, that's a BIG red flag. Best of luck."
9t5nhh,100% NTA. 
9t5psz,NTA. You have a right to decide who gets to participate in your life. Sounds like you’re totally justified in keeping him out of it.
9t5tav,"NTA. You said she was 50s not 75. She should’ve gotten there earlier if she wanted a good seat, and when someone says “it’s taken,” it’s taken. "
9t6a8e,"Not really. Everyone loves to piss of stupid children, It’s a common guilty pleasure. The kids were ass holes, they don’t deserve a single piece of candy."
9t6ctw,"NTA, you don't have to like her. You will probably learn to live with her by time."
9t6o2w,"NTA. Doesn't matter if she has conditions, if she made your life worse you had every right to decrease her part in it. It's good that you recognized the pattern. If anything you were *too* patient."
9t6v2h,NTA.  You're not obligated to be someone's therapist for the sake of being polite.
9t6vik,"YTA

Expecting someone to put their name on a lease for you is crazy. You're right that you've done something extremely kind for him by allowing him to stay, especially if it's rent free but this is just plain insane. 

Guess who's on the line for anything that goes wrong? The people who signed the lease. Him not understanding it is a completely ok reason. Would you sign a contract for someone else if you didn't understand it? of course not. 

You're justified if you want to kick him out because it is your place but you shouldn't kick him out because he doesn't want to be liable for your fuck ups"
9t75g2,"NTA, but it seems like you're looking for high school movie dramatic ""love,"" and that's not what actual love is. It would be a shame to pass over something real trying to chase an obsession."
9t7eti,"NTA, it's your roommate who is the asshole. Sounds like a roommate from hell, and believe me, I've been there! 
Your situation kind of sucks though, because your ex-roommate will probably never understand... 
Good luck, and stay strong xD"
9t7hyg,"Absolutely not the asshole. Good for you for being upfront with what you’re looking for and what you felt. Shame on her for acting like her feelings were more important - seems like a red flag.
"
9t7mgw,"I think it would be better to discuss it with your wife first and see if she’d be comfortable with that. It could really mess with her friendship if you do that behind her back, even though your intentions are good. "
9t7qbb,NTA. You're just stupid for getting into this agreement in the first place. It's not exactly clear to me how this billing works but you should not have to pay $240 for this person's storage. If possible change her over to the account owner. I'm not sure how to keep her accountable but if your card is on the account then you might have to change the locks and give her access only after she covers the cost of the unit.
9t8m9n,"Yes, you are.  You need to get over it because you have a whole lifetime of working ahead of you, unless you plan to spend your life in mommy's basement. It's part of life."
9t8pxo,"If I was your coworker I would just assume you’re a pretentious prick and write you off. If you came to me at a later point asking for help, I wouldn’t be jumping to comply. 

To each their own though. "
9t8web,NTA for sure. Rabbit is a toxic person. You don’t need that kind of stress in your life. You are completely fine for cutting ties with her.
9t97li,"NTA. 

These are his kids as much as they are yours and he should take more of the responsibility of you're overwhelmed. It isn't selfish to ask for your husband to attend to his family. Good for him for offering to hire a nanny to free up your time, but it doesn't solve the problem of his lack of emotional investment despite his good intentions. I think it's perfectly fair for you to tell him exactly this. "
9t9aoz,"She came from overseas to see the family and you ignored her the entire time. Definitely the asshole, she’s your grandma show some respect and spend even a tiny amount of time a day whilst she’s there to talk to her."
9t9rqc,"You’re probably not an asshole, but what you shared makes it sound like your expectations are partially based on what you did for her. And that could lead to disappointment in the best case and bitchiness in the worst. "
9ta230,"Not at all, that's how jobs work, you gave them 2 weeks. It is up to you if they ask and you decide to but you're in no way obligated to, nor are you an ass for not wanting to. "
9ta82q,"NTA imo at all

You actually took steps to not cause a larger problem.  De-escalating by leaving the area was probably the best you could've done. I would just suggest you talk to her about the texts and how you feel that when she is impaired it's not the best time to have serious (even if they shouldn't be)  conversations."
9tajaj,Dump that crazy bitch
9tajyn,"NTA. If anything, he's that asshole for having the audacity to ask you to spend that much money on him. Especially when he's living off of you already. I would never ask my SO to spend $2,000 on me for anything. He can continue to play the video games that his current rig can handle, until he starts contributing. If you buy that computer, you'd only be enabling him. 

If you're gonna spend that money, spend it clearing your debt. "
9tamas,No your not the ass hole. It's only right to pay to play. Yes you can torrent things but it's not the same like having the books for your campaigns. They should definitely split the cost with you especially if your hosting. 
9tare8,"YTA. 

Diversifying a workforce actually causes an increase in productivity. People from different background bring different ideas into the mix and this is something useful for a company. Studies have shown this but I don't have access to them, you could easily research the topic on your own. 

It sounds like the test were skewed for men to get in, for whatever reason, and the people who did this probably didn't do it on purpose. They just probably weren't thinking about it at the time. But your company realizes that female employees, even if they can't dominate the tests like men can, add value to their company in ways that **men can't**.

So if they want the top 15 female performers and the top 15 male performers. There is nothing sexist about that. They are leveling the playing field to achieve their desired result. "
9tavut,"NTA - she knew she was in wrong for that and she can stay feeling up her boyfriend all she likes to be catty, he's not your husband...."
9tb3io,"YTA, people don't do their landscaping so you can walk all over it.  There are pathways for a reason.  You can walk, roll, and pee all over the grass on your own property, but you need to respect other people's property."
9tb4rg,"NTA. I don't get why people care so much about birthdays. Maybe it's because for the past few years something bad has always been going on during my birthday, but I could care less about the day I was born. If you're calling people idiots for forgetting your birthday, you need help."
9tb8vq,NTA sounds like an entitled little bitch to me bro. You did good 👌🏾

9tbqyt,NTA. Your roommate has no jurisdiction over your private space. It’d be one thing if he focused on the food/beverage containers as that could invite unwelcome creepy crawlies. But still you’re NTA.
9tbvrp,NTA. You're just being considerate
9tc1th,"Have you told her that you want some time alone at the house on your days off? 
I think YTA here only because you said “she didn’t look that bad”. It’s shitty to invalidate the pain of someone with a chronic illness, especially when you love that person.  You should be more empathetic. "
9tc2n4,"NTA
You have my total support in this."
9tc37h,"You pay rent too, you're nta. She sounds obnoxious, if putting on a pair of shorts is too much. You didn't even say wear a shirt, you just don't want her semi nude bottom on YOUR FURNITURE! lol if any of you get pink eye, you know who to blame. "
9tc7a0,"I would say NTA since it sounds like she's not really a friend to you but rather is just using you to fill the gap between boyfriends. 

However I have a novel idea, why not tell her she's giving you mixed messages and ask her why. If you're interested in her enough to contemplate dating her but also divested enough to cut her off, you don't have anything to lose. "
9tc86i,"There are no assholes here.

They made a polite request.  You politely declined. 

Rinse. Repeat.

It's irrelevant that they weren't paying attention.  It's irrelevant that you think they were texting about you.  Everyone was polite.  That is the only relevant detail."
9tcer3,"Sort of, if it's a kid how do you know that their parents are too broke tp afford a costume but they still want to participate? "
9tci24,"They sort of let you know where you stood on the Totem pole. If you want to cut them off, you’re not an asshole. But before you do, I would definitely confront them and let them know about themselves. At the end of the day? They don’t *owe* you a reason or an excuse, but you’re entitled to be respected, and if walking away from them makes you feel better, by all means. "
9tcj2n,YTA wash your dishes before you start worrying about other people's messes.

9te0gp,"NTA. You both clearly want to keep in touch, and IN is quite a ways away from FL, so it’s not like you’ll see each other too often anyways. She can’t tell you who you can or can’t be friends with, even if it’s her own dad. "
9te1nb,NTA dude. Sounds like B was using the land as a dumping ground and to hoard shit. He can either accept a small piece of the land or take none.
9te292,"If everyone went around destroying the property of people who made them mad, well, we'd have a lot of destroyed property. It doesn't matter what he did to ""deserve"" it, if slashing his tires wasn't enough to make yta, trying to justify your behavior now certainly does."
9te6r2,"Not really an asshole unless you're doing it in their face, but out of context, imagine someone video recording and capture them crying and then panning over to you looking at them laughing.

9tedjw,You parked shitty and you know it. Why not just fix it? YTA 
9teiaf,NTA. she can’t expect you to give her free shot you have to do your job 
9tel3c,Not the asshole. Everyone has their limit and you've reached yours. I'm horrible with money but I'd never once ask my husband for money. And she is trying to manipulate you by telling you not to control her. 
9teoih,"She’s the asshole for laughing at your grandfathers suffering. You’re the asshole for harassing her and her sister when they obviously don’t want to talk to you. You said yourself they think you’re weird and creepy, why not leave them alone?? "
9tet1z,"Yes you're the asshole. You forgot your girlfriend's birthday and promised her to spend more time with her to make her feel more like a priority to you again, only to jump ship to attend your friend's birthday. Now I'm not saying that just because you have an SO you should forget all the other relationships in your life, quite the contrary, but why tf are you saying that you'll ""have to stay"" for the entire weekend for this bd party? Why can't it be a stop in and hang out for a few hours then return to your girlfriend? Like I said, normally wanting to spend time with your friends, especially on their birthdays, is perfectly fine and an SO being upset about that is just jealous, but in this case you already know you hurt her feelings and promised to make it up to her only to spin around and break that promise, and THAT'S why you're the asshole in this particular case."
9tezkq,YTA. You puked on her car when she was doing you a favor by driving home. Pay for the freaking car wash. 
9tf60t,"NTA because your brother was not helping with the family and you had all the reasons to call him out. He is your brother, so you should apologize and congratulate him for his new baby."
9tf819,"Both assholes. 

On one hand it's unreasonable of you to expect someone to turn down a free vacation. Vacations are expensive and getting to go for free is a great opportunity.

On the other hand, he should have considered your feelings and talked to you about this first. Having a reaction of ""that's too bad"" shows that he doesn't really care about your opinion on the matter. 

Ideally he would've talked to you first about the offer and you, understanding that this is a big opportunity would have let him go. He gets 2.5 weeks of vacation time a year but he doesn't get 2.5 weeks of **free** vacation time a year. You'll always have time later to go with him."
9tf83n,"NTA

You are allowed to set reasonable boundaries and I think ""Don't cuddle with another man in bed"" is a very reasonable boundary to set, regardless of sexual orientation. "
9tfl8r,"NTA, if he lets you, just make sure you clean any messes you make while you’re there. "
9tfo87,No.  She probably doesn't really want to be your friend.  It's just a thing she said when rejecting you 
9tfqg8,"Lol, not an asshole. Quite the opposite "
9tfs7l,"NTA for telling them, TA for laughing at this.

It may not have been malicious, but it's really unsettling to be sent a video of you when you didn't know you were being filmed."
9tfud3,NTA. You'd be the asshole if you stayed in a relationship you don't really want to be in. It would be far worse for her to think that your relationship was essentially a lie.
9tg14x,Where is any of that coming from
9tg7fs,"I mean it wasn’t great, but you’re high school students. You’re gonna make dumb decisions. And nine months isn’t nine years. Give yourself a break. Was it a dick move? Maybe a bit. But your nta. "
9tg97n,"Not the asshole for turning her down, but still an ass for being rude about it. This girl is well aware of her weight and rejection sucks enough as it is, no need to make her feel even worse. Your ""friend"" is also an ass for subjecting her to that. If you felt so strongly about heavier people as to have a sexual preference about them, surely they would have known that before hand? An alternative option would have been to tell your friend you weren't interested and let them find her someone else. There is a difference between ""not sugarcoating shit"" and human decency/being polite, especially with people you don't know well."
9tgbqv,"YTA 100%. Being in a relationship is being there for your partner. If you legitimately could not handle that discussion at that time, that’s okay, but you need to communicate that without acting like a child. And if your needs aren’t being met, you need to work that out or leave. But you can’t just be a dick to your girlfriend because she won’t fuck you."
9tgnf7,"You aren't an asshole for having feelings. If you let those feelings control your actions and influence how you treat her or how you talk to her, then yeah absolutely you'd be an asshole. 

You should give gifts because you enjoy giving gifts, not because you want something in return. It sounds like you have a bit of both; you love putting the time into selecting a gift and seeing the results, e.g. your friend being ecstatic with your gift choices as well as having that some effort spent on you.

You also recognize that not everyone feels the same way about giving / receiving gifts and I'm actually one of those people. I show that I care in other ways and the people in my life know that about me. You recognize that this is true for your friend as well, but you're still upset. I think the main reason you're upset is because you've designated your 21st birthday as something special. To someone who doesn't really care about birthdays it's just another birthday.

Try to evaluate whether you spend a lot of time selecting gifts for people so that they'll do the same for you, or whether you actually enjoy giving gifts. That should help give you some perspective."
9tgpmo,"YNTA, or at the very least, very little bit of an asshole. She was likely acting out of desperation for the emotional side of a relationship (from you, hence her call confessing) while she had an intimate one going on (or theorized at least). She, however, was a major asshole with all that extra drama. Frankly, you shoulda dropped her after the first ghosting incident you wrote. If she said she was in love with you, but proceeded to hardly talk to you for over 2 months, it was probably fake. You got majorly played my friend"

9tgu1h,"NTA they overstepped a line, especially if your sisters kids didn’t know. While you could have handled the situation better (ie a little calmer and nicer) calling her out was not an asshole move"
9tgw7k,"No. I'm sure she's still enjoying a drink and the music. As long as you participate in her loves too, sounds to me like she's not being forced. You'd be an asshole if you forced her to participate but there's nothing wrong with having different taste in hobbies!"
9tgy6u,What happened was a miscommunication not a lie  
9tgz1m,"NTA. If you dont like someone, you dont like someone, just how things go. Its better if youre honest so they can start to get closure and try to move on.

9th9eq,"You are absolutely the asshole. Regular occurrence or not, not going with your partner to the **EMERGENCY** room because you want to sleep absolutely makes you the asshole. 

I would've broken up with you if I was the gf, you need to apologize to her ASAP and make it up to her if you care at all about her. "
9thepg,YTA. You build up an unrealistic idea of a person and get pissy when you find out they're human. If you think you're always surrounded by assholes chances are you're the asshole.
9thkao,"Nah, laughing at someone privately within a group of friends who don't know them doesn't make you an asshole in my opinion. As long as what your doing won't impact them I say go for it"

9thuj9,NTA. She’s the asshole for breaking into people’s cars. 
9thv56,"NTA at all. That sounds like a very strange kind of friendship (a nude every day, asking him to have a kid with her), I'd be uncomfortable too. Also, what kind of argument is ""she lives somewhere else so I can't cheat anyway"", is he implying that you'd need to be worried about that if she lived closer? Maybe he just phrased it wrong, but what the fuck. "
9thxvo,"NTA for being upset about his behavior and wanting to call him out on it, but beating him up? What the fuck is wrong with you? Just ask him to reimburse you for the gas money and stop being friends with that guy. "
9tih57,"NTA.
You’ve got to look out for yourself now, and her lack of care for how this is hurting you is pretty crap. You shared a lot of time together, and I’m sure much of that was happy. Don’t let your memory of this relationship be soured by drawing it out even further and hurting yourself more."
9tinrp,"NTA. Alarm goes off, you get out of bed. Maybe let it snooze once. It would be better for them to get the extra hour sleep instead of an hour of hazy snoozing with the alarm anyway. You have a condition, that is more important than them wanting to snooze for an hour. Try getting one of these.

9tiu0h,You’re an asshole if you make a deal out of it. Or try and stress the difference between pink and fuchsia in any mundane conversation 
9tiybs,Tough one tbh but i would say no. If dudes a dick let him have it. You make your own bed type deal.
9tj2de,That's not even arguing with a political stance. He's embarrassed because he said something racist and you didn't let him get away with it. 
9tj844,"> What bothers me though is that it’s something based on slavic/europan folklore, which is a white culture, and I’m pretty sure that if it was a fantasy series based on african cuture people would get mad and say characters were being whitewashed if any white characters were cast. 

You're right in the sense that it wouldn't fit with ""history,"" but you'd be wrong to bitch about it. No offense, but a game centered around a magic dude fighting a bunch of mythical monsters doesn't exactly scream ""must stick to realism only."" I love the series, but the idea of whining about what color someone in the game is would make me laugh in someone's face."
9tji7a,NTA -  He is being an unsympathetic asshole and clearly has some control problems as well.

I dealt with judgement for wanting a vasectomy because I was so young.

Ya know what though? I know what’s right for me just like you know what’s right for you.

A year later and I’m still happy with my choice.

My wife and I had to talk about it a lot and it was certainly a big shift in her thoughts and everything but we’re both fine with it now.

If you know, you know."
9tlbw4,"lol no, you are not the asshole. Customer service is a legitimate thing on which to rate the quality of a business. By harassing you, the GM was providing poor customer service. This is relevant information which can justify an updated rating to reflect the GM's actions. People tend to forget that actions have consequence, and if you take actions that make you look like an idiot when you're at work, it reflects poorly upon your place of employment."
9tlex0,"I'm gonna say you are the asshole. 

It's true that she should have kept her word with the 12pm one. But in all honesty, she has a job as well and it goes far beyond dealing with your specific walk-in issue. Advising meetings usually take quite a bit of time, usually at *least* 10 minutes and can last up to an hour or more. 

If she's getting ready for lunch, getting ready for other duties, etc., then she had a good reason to ask you to come back later. Advisers aren't usually an hourly job that strictly follows the time. They're usually salaried jobs that have approximate timeframes so that people can know when to *approximately* come in.

Also, restaurants will be just as unhappy with you demanding food if you come in 10 minutes before closing. Set an appointment next time.

She was also respectful, apologizing and asking you to come back later. You couldn't take it for an answer though, then you had to insult her work ethic."
9tlj32,"Hmmmm...I'm going to disagree with the other comments, and say that you are being kind of an asshole.  The rules of the contest were straightforward: the winner of the raffle gets a room named after them. This woman donated $10 just like everyone else, and should be entitled to the same prize as anyone else.  If you think her last name is offensive or inappropriate, how about compromising and and naming the room after her first name? Or, full name? That way, the last name won't seem out of place (I think I can guess what the name is).  

On a separate note, if someone is ""scandalized"" because you named the boardroom after a name they don't like or seems inappropriate, that's their problem.  By the way, the scandalized is in quotes, because it's what I would call faux outrage.  Any jackass would know that you wouldn't name a room after a sex act. They know full well that it is a last name, and they simply don't like it.  Honestly, if someone thinks you intentionally named a room after a sex act, they are probably not the kind of people you want to do business with (unless you work for a porn website, I suppose). "
9tltzu,"YTA for how you spoke to her.  It sucks that your car was totaled and that you're concussed, but it's no excuse for being so rude to someone.  You obviously can't drive your car, but you could have not responded instead of being mean."
9tm00p,"NTA. 

When I read the title I was readying my pitchfork haha but you are definitely not the asshole. I will say that she is likely being defensive because she is insecure about her ability to train/socialize her dog, because I feel like that when my dog exhibits behaviours I wish I had been better at correcting. It makes me feel like I failed her. 

But from the very calm description I just read, you seem to have handled this very appropriately and she seems to be reacting in a very harsh and rude manner. 

If I were you, I wouldn’t worry too much now that the landlords already know- they will hopefully do something about it. 

If you did decide you wanted to try and work with her again, I would consider trying to come down to her level a bit. Not in terms of being rude like she was haha but consider how it could be intimidating for her that your family breeds and trains dogs, and your dog is so well behaved. It could be embarrassing for her. So I would wager that’s why she is lashing out. Hope that makes sense!"

It's pretty irrelevant that you're not transgender.  Trans people can date cis people, you don't have to be trans to date someone who is.  You sound pretty ignorant about sexual identity and orientation, but you're under no obligation to date or be touched by anyone if you don't want it."

9tn5is,"I'm betting we would get a WILDLY different description of events from your wife.  Out of the blue, she just comes home and wants a divorce from her perfect husband of three years who has done everything for her and been nothing but great?  She's on the mortgage, but the house belongs to you because you pay for it?  If you stop paying for it, whose credit gets ruined, just yours or both of you?  Who takes care of the kids while you're out paying for the house?   If she works also, does she keep her entire paycheck, or is her money expressly earmarked to not go toward the mortgage because only your dollars go toward the mortgage?  She makes zero contribution to making this household run?

If you're not legally separated with an agreement, there's a good chance she's right, that she should be allowed to stay in the house that is also hers.

You might be the asshole.

&#x200B;

Edit: And for the record, I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.  Maybe she does have some kind of mental problem, or maybe she's cheating with some other guy, who knows.  I'm just saying these things can be very complicated, and it can be hard to listen to the other side when you're hurt and feel like you did everything right."

9tnnbh,"So by your own admission, she told you about this trip well in advance and you chose to ignore it, saved up the funds from her ""fun money"" and kept up her contribution to your agreed savings, has a completely legitimate reason to go because she is going to be doing activities related to her job/interests with colleagues in her field, and you wouldn't even want to go with her because you think old stuff isn't fun.

Sorry, but you would be the asshole. It's not like she is going out on a booze cruise with her homie Donkey Doug. Also, Turkey has been deemed safe to visit in 2018. And for all your concerns of her being a female traveler, that seems like all the more reason to have a male travel companion, right? If you don't want that to be you, that's fine. But you should support her because she isn't doing anything wrong."
9tntwe,"Based on what you’ve told me I really think it was him who sent the message.

Reason B- maybe this is misandrist of me but I really can’t picture a woman saying to another woman “I’m gonna rape you”. It just seems pretty outlandish to me.  

I would stop talking to him whether he sent the message personally or not but I do think he sent it.  Nta "

9tr2y9,"NTA, but I don't think your boyfriend is in the wrong if it's part of his nightly routine and is something he enjoys. I think you two should compromise.

(She wouldn’t still be in contact with that flaming sack of dicks if she really hated him and she wouldn’t have have left you with a pedo if she was as caring as she claims.

I imagine when you grew up you weren't exposed to porn much and find it strange. That is 100% fine.

I imagine she was more exposed to it and enjoyed it. That is also 100% fine.

Sex is often like anything else and we make a big deal of it when we just need to work through it like any other relationship problem.

 Imagine if one of you tiedies the house 10 mins everyday and the other does an hour or so once a week but never does anything in between. The person who tidies everyday may well get annoyed as the house gets messy in the week. But as an outsider no one is wrong.

How would you solve the problem?
You need to sit down and have a frank discussion and hopefully reach a compromise. Talking about sex can be much scarier than talking about cleaning as we attach a lot of emotion to it.

Maybe you can replace the porn to some extent. Maybe you can sext and she can be imagining you instead? Or maybe she can cut down. But you do need to remember that as with most things porn in moderation is fine. And maybe you just agree it becomes one of the few things you never talk about. I.e. most people poop but most of us don't want long graphic discussions from our partner."

9ttnjb,Sounds like your cat has a urinary tract infection.  Time to see a vet.
9ttrzr,"Nta, but give him time. It’s awkward seeing your younger sibling in a relationship. Especially if you’ve never been in one. He just doesn’t know how to react. 

This might sound worse then I intend it to, so please be patient with me (I’m running on no sleep and a cranky toddler on me) but he also probably imagined the two of you bonding over girls, and you won’t be doing that. It’s probably hard for him, as much as he loves you, and as much as he accepts you. 

If he brings it up again try to remain calm. Say what may or may not happen in your bedroom is of no ones business and that it has no bearings on your standing in a relationship. 

Either way, I’m sorry that you had to have such an unpleasant conversation with your brother. "
9ttwhh,Not the asshole. It’s bad enough the employee has to touch it. Someone else’s cough hands or sneeze hands or whatever could be all over it. 
9tu9x1,"He's definitely the asshole for exploding at you, especially in front of your kid, but this is obviously after reaching a breaking point of not being taken seriously. How would you feel if he called you silly for something that mattered to you? I don't know why it wouldn't kill you just to unlock the screen door and close the door half an hour before he's set to come home or something. You need to reach a compromise somehow."
9tufjy,Asshole? No. Idiot? Yep.
9tuk0e,"NTA. If your BF wants a brand new car, let him pay for it. Both his insurance and his family have already offered him perfectly reasonable alternatives to replace his totaled vehicle.

9turr5,"Not the asshole! People get ideas of mental illnesses (whether its addiction, bpd, bipolar, etc) in their head and it becomes this huge stigma for them. That’s on them. You’re obviously working to be better and that’s something to be proud of! When someone says those hurtful things there’s nothing wrong with gently reminding them that you’ve worked through the issues that they say are irreparable. Destigmatize yourself to them, s it were."

9tuxa1,"Dude, you came across as a creeper. Relax. Start over. 

Life (and dates) don’t often go precisely as planned. Saying OUT LOUD to some young girl “this didn’t go as I expected” sounds bizarre and demanding — like, what DID you expect? Immediate sex? As a young woman I’d have been alarmed by your remark. 

You could have said, graciously, “oh, bummer, I’d hoped you’d want to go out for ice cream” (or a walk or for coffee or whatever) but not been pushy about it. "

While neither side may hold identical values to yours, I can guarantee that one will still align more with you on certain issues, and you must find that person/party and vote for it, sure, you may still be choosing an 'evil' but lets be honest they aren't actually evil, just hold some view you don't like, and still want the best for your community most likely, at least in some aspects. It is about being an active part of your community and making sure you are represented in government."

You couldn’t have predicted what happened and you aren’t an asshole for going over invited and running out when you heard her mum coming. I’m not advocating sneaking around but you she told you to leave quickly if her mum came back (I’m guessing this is what you meant) and that’s what you did. It’s a horrible situation but you are not at fault at all. Please don’t feel guilty for the actions of a monster.

9tydz7,"YTA for being so entitled.

>And I'm a little mad because even if I wanted to move my things out of there I couldn't. There's no one I know with the space, I sure as heck don't have the space, and I can't afford a storage unit.

You know what else you could do? Sell some of the stuff that you don't need so you can have it with you and not at your Ex's house.

> I also wasn't under the impression that he was going to be renting out part of the house to anyone once I moved out--it was never something that he talked to me about.

Why would your Ex ask for your opinion about renting out his own home? You don't live there, so you don't have a say in what your Ex does with his home.

"
9tyh8n,"NTA. It is challenging to find the right balance supporting a partner with depression. My boyfriend suffers from depression, which has at times in the past been severe, and there is no way to escape some level of stress and frustration when the person you love is suffering and there's no way for you to fix it. 

What helped me a lot was getting more into my own hobbies and always having a sort of wishful to do list that meant that if plans for a fun day together (even if it was just a fun lazy Netflix binge day) were spoiled, I had a backup plan for myself. It helped distract from my need to actively ""support"" - which helped boyfriend as he didn't want/ need me to be actively anything and just needed to do his own thing - and also meant he didn't have as much guilt about ruining the day for me, to add to whatever other feelings were bouncing around in his head.  It's not perfect but it improved things a lot for me. 

I have never however put up with being treated poorly, and he is accountable for his actions irrespective of his mood. I will tell him when something is not OK and he will tell me if he needs space or whatever he needs to get himself in order. 

I have bought small things to ease sources of frustration, much like your non- sticks, because those are easy fixes and why wouldn't I do something simple and nice that helps him out?

What's really concerning is what you describe about feeling like you're always running interference to keep him in a good mood. I completely get it, but it will burn you out. You need to learn that you are not responsible for his mental state. He must manage it himself, and you need to look out for your own wellbeing.  If you are on eggshells all the time in case you break his good mood, then he is not managing it properly and you are probably over compensating because you want to fix everything. 

Therapy for you might help, hobbies and having more you time might help, attending some joint therapy might help to agree an approach that works for you both. 

However, it's also OK to want to bow out of a relationship that is literally giving you panic attacks. There is no shame in putting your needs first. "

9tzui7,"Uh, how old are y'all? Your uncle sounds like a literal child. You're NTA. He said something you didn't like and asked him to stop. He refused so you blocked him.

9tzuwf,"NTA for being annoyed and wanting straightforward answers to direct questions. Possibly YTA for interupting them rudely. But you don't have to be rude when you intercept their tangential rant. A 'that sounds like something interesting but can you answer the question first?' would be more appropriate. (When they seem unable to answer, try: it's okay if you don't have an answer right now, we can revisit it at a later time if necessary.)

Kinda YTA for making it about old people. To be frank, people who talk like this generally have always talked like so. People who don't probably won't ever start. Sure there are cases of age affecting cognitive ability but that's not applicable to all old people."

You even said you felt the same just repressed it? You just put your own wants ahead of his feelings.

You've done a classic rebound and sounds like you're going to be back with your Ex. Just remember this time J won't be there to pickup the pieces when it goes wrong again.

9u2uv3,"YTA I don't think we should be looking down on obese people but rather inform them about the health risk of obesity. I DO agree that it is good for people to think it is NOT ok to be obese, but I DON'T think it is ok for your friends to be teasing him about weight. They should be encouraging him to lose weight out of health concerns, not by bullying him for the way he looks.  Even a joke can be extremely hurtful. I used to be pretty chubby and lost a lot of weight between middle school and high school. This is just my viewpoint. I don't think people should believe being obese is ok, but I also don't encourage negative comments of any kind for the way they look, including jokes. Looks have nothing to do with it, its all about the health factor. "

Yes, you should be happy he did anything for you. 

But.....

At the same time, it is YOUR birthday. It’s about YOU and not him. All you wanted was a scarf that was within reasonable price. Nothing wrong with that. I think him taking you out it sweet, even if you didn’t want to go. So I would appreciate that. However he really should have bought you the scarf instead of something you implied you didn’t want. It was probably more expensive than the scarf, too. But as long as you weren’t vocal about how you’re upset, I’d say NTA. "
9u6q4d,Could she have depression? Ofcourse you’re not wrong. Giving her 2 year guidelines seems a bit controlling and overbearing.  Could you be causing the her anxiety? Go to couples therapy 
9u7jxj,"NTA... Everyone is responsible for their actions and you were completely right that she was throwing red flags. It was his choice to go along with what she said. If you decide to change your mind and become his friend again, that would be fine but you cannot be expected to. In any case, neither you nor your sister ought to date someone who treats you as their secondary choice. Everyone deserves better than that.

All that said, he was far from the worst asshole around, people make mistakes. But nobody is obligated to forget every mistake. Just do what you feel is best, and avoid dating him."
9u7lgd,"NTA. But it's an issue roommates have had since rooms were invented. Lol.

I had a case like this with a friend of mine. He just kept taking pictures and one day sent it to the house master. So the guy got an official warning. Could you do something like that? Do you think it could work?

If yes, just take pics for a week or two and exaggerate if you hsve to. Then send the pics to the authorities.

Or maybe post the pics on social media and tag him if he's there. "

9u8313,"NTA, He seems more interested in video games than you, and that's a problem. If I only got to see my girlfriend once every few weeks she wouldn't even have to ask me to quit playing video games. 

Hell, I see her several times a week and she doesn't have to ask me to quit playing them. If I'm playing something when she comes over I get to a stopping point and stop. 

This guy seems like an asshole. "
9u868x,You need to confess to him and tell him you only did it to help him.  But I'd say your not the asshole just talk about it with him next time.
9u8bre,NTA.  You made it clear and communicated that it  wasn't something you were comfortable with and she ignored you. You're completely in the right. 
9u8kes,"You said he tried to stop you from being an idiot and you still did it anyways, and then he did stop the fight when you told him too. He did literally every thing you commanded him too, which he shouldn’t have cause you’re an asshole. And then you make up excuses about her being a pro fighter because you got your ass beat after you started a fight lol. Please do leave him though, you’ll be doing him a favor. "
9u8l28,"NTA you shouldn’t have to participate in a gift exchange if you don’t feel everyone is 100% on board with it.

The price of the gift shouldn’t matter, what should matter is the fact it seems your extended family doesn’t seem to be interested in participating 100%. Maybe suggest to your father that you’d be interested if the list of family members included changes?"
9u8qpq,Nta but you're not great at reading people lol
9u8uy4,Nah I wouldn't hang out with him either he sounds annoying asf 
9u8vbf,"NTA, this friend has taken far too many liberties and disrupted your home life. Ask for the key back, it’s your home your rules. "
9u92gz,"Nope, highly insensitive thing to say on her part. Not just that, but it tells you exactly what she is (or was - and which is it?) looking for in a relationship. And wanting good sex on her part is not wrong. But if it's not what you're dating her for then I would definitely be questioning whether you two have the right expectations about each other. I'm not really sure if you should dump her or talk to her about her expectations in a relationship. But definitely one of those two things is necessary. Probably the talking thing is a better place to start. Nothing's going to improve if you don't talk it out. But you have to choose your words carefully.

Bullshit @ the response telling you to let her talk about other guys dicks. That guy is probably just used to hearing that. It's become normal to him. (I kid, I kid)

Feeling insecure is one thing, but feeling like your expectations of a relationship don't match someone else's is another. But you should definitely try your best to talk it over before you get upset. (Or *more* upset, anyway!)"
9u945y,"Not the asshole. You are responsible for protecting the safety and security of your children and that's what you are doing, even though it's tough on you. That's respectable. Not just protecting them physically - also the safety and stability of the environment around them (for this will shape them mentally as they grow up) -  but from what you said, I would actually fear for their physical safety as well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRwuu0u3UFA - This guy's an electronics technician but I happened to watch this video of his recently and he's got a damn good explanation of why allowing children to be around conflict is absolutely horrible for them."
9u9660,"NTA, but I think some things need to be said.

1) You don't need to go around getting treatments to ""increase your libido"" just because your husband is sad.

2) I think the faked minor flirting needs to stop, it seems like a major reason why he gets disappointed is because he feels like he's being led on.

All in all, this needs to be a conversation between you and your husband. "
9u9bxe,"She sounds like she and her friends are consentually trading nudes. Most of what you hear are stories of things that have happened to men who did those things without consent, and I'm sorry but it is not ""scary to be a man these days"" as long as you get do not unconsentually harrass, sexually assault or rape women. Which, btw, being harrassed, sexually assaulted or raped sounds a lot scarier than being a victim of your own stupidity/lack of common sense/decency, so you might want to get a little perspective there. But yeah, YTA."
9u9by1,NTA. He's an asshole for staying with you knowing what you felt and that it differed from what he wanted- and assuming you weren't serious/would change your mind. This honestly seems incredibly disrespectful towards you.
9u9dm0,"NTA, but you have to accept this could be damaging to your relationship with your stepmother/her kids."
9u9gzo,"NTA. There's been sexual attraction between her and multiple friends in the group, despite claiming not having sex with them if she's over 18 it might be the case and she doesn't want you to think about that.
Others chances are she's still pursuing romantic/sexual relations with some of them and can't have you around doing so.
Best case scenario her friends don't like you, and have expressed so to her.

Not an easy sight friend, I'd be looking for another partner, plenty fish in the sea.

""We only accept the love we think we deserve"""
9u9s3s,"NTA

She sounds like a real piece of work, and she deserves less than what you've already given her."
9u9tlt,"NTA for telling her how you feel, buuut, didn’t you already do that and it made things very awkward?  If she felt the same way, she would’ve reciprocated at that time.   You can tell her how you feel, just be prepared for her to say she loves you like a brother or a friend.  She will have to tell her bf, and that will be the end of your friendship.  That being said, it’s the best thing for you.  You’ll never find someone if you stay in this situation.   Of course there’s always a chance she will reciprocate.  Either way, once you tell her, things will never be the same between you. But again, it’s for the best anyway. "
9u9ucl,"Okay, so forget the whole Daylight Savings thing, forget the whole clock thing. Let's break this down.

Your girlfriend, whom you talk to every single day (or nearly every day or whatever), got pissed that you called her an hour late ONE DAY.

Here's what you do. You give her a day or two to apologize for being a total bitch over the most goddamn fucking stupid reason.

If she's still a bitch, you break it off because, dude, she's totally insane. That is not a valid reason to be annoyed, let alone angry.

If she's angry about this, imagine how much she won't be able to handle a real mistake you'll make. And you will make a mistake because everyone makes mistakes."
9u9ugu,YTA.  You're not her dad. It's none of your business if she makes out with some dude.
9u9w64,"NTA. You were intimidated and panicked. I'm nearly the exact size as you are and would have probably reacted the same way. I'm slightly meeker than you and have a tendency to over apologize, but it's ten at night, dark, late and a strange, large man approaches you? Sorry, dude, get the fuck away from me."
9u9w8a,NTA- date who you want. And when it comes to academics they take priority but please let him know that. Make it clear why you can't give him as much time as he needs. You don't want him assuming you want nothing to do with him.
9ua5g2,"Yes. I get how you feel, I’m the same way, but relationships are about balance. You making her constantly make the trip and sleep elsewhere is not balance. In a mature relationship, sometimes you do things you don’t really like doing (like chores) because you love them and it strengthens the relationship. She’s meeting you 100% of the way and you’re refusing to even meet her half way *for three years*. It’s time to make a compromise."
9ua5na,You aren't the asshole.  Your parents and sister are. It sucks that your  parents have a favorite child and a scapegoat child.  The best you can do is keep your head down and protect yourself until you can get out of there.  Once you are an adult you can surround yourself with people who respect you and are fair to you.
9uaav4,It really depends *how* you tell them. Try talking to your boss. Tell him it interrupts your work.
9uanxe,"Given that stuff about the phone and especially you trying to call her again from your cell phone after using a work phone, she sounds like she's using you, probably laughing at you behind your back. If you had *not* tried again on the cell phone, then there would be a chance that she was able to reactivate her phone that day. But clearly that's not the case, and so I'd say you are not the asshole."

9uat10,NTA. You had a surgery. He could have helped you just this much.
9uav06,"Saved your friend from an embarrassing situation  but to do so you had to tell everyone the secret he had asked you to keep. YTA, but for the right reasons. Think I would have done the same"
9uazvw,Half of all humor is reading the room. You read it poorly. YTA...though I personally find it humorous. 
9ubl05,"NTA, you're not his mother."
9ubm8u,"Okay so at first when I saw the title my initial thought was that you were overreacting, but the fact that he was the cause of your pain for a lot of years deserves a much bigger apology. It seems as though he thought it was in the past and that ""it doesn't matter anymore"", but that's definitely not the case as the memories are still fresh in your mind. Definitely NTA, he should be a little more sensitive and understand why you want an apology "
9ucwiy,His need for sleep to function takes priority over your need for fuzzy kitty cuddles. How is that even a question? GF is TA. 
9ucxj9,"YTA. 

My grandmother has dementia and she's constantly calling my family's old phone number looking for my mom. We haven't lived there in over 5 years, but that number is fixed in her head.
I feel grateful that I grew up in a small town where the new family knew the situation and wouldn't treat her like you treated this individual. 

You should always treat the elderly how you would want your own grandparents treated when they get to that age. "
9ud0o2,"Bit of an asshole. You don’t need to outright tell her she’s not welcome. That’s rude and close to bullying, especially if you upset her to the point of tears. She’s new and trying to fit in. 

If you think she lied then take it up with HR. You don’t get to police everyone else. You say she’s egotistical, but you sound it too. You don’t have to like everyone you work with, but no need to be a dick. "
9ud0sk,YTA I think generally you don’t sleep with friends exes unless you don’t want to continue the friendship. Or let a ton of time pass before you do that. 
9ud2gy,"I know a lot of people are saying NTA because its unreasonable of her to continue to be friends with this guy but honestly I don't agree.

As a woman there's been plenty of times where male friends have been interested in me and I've turned them down and it honestly gets tiring to cut ties with every dude who says he's into you, especially if they're in a friend group or an extended circle (such as a university club or something) together. It makes it a whole big awkward thing that really sucks to deal with , I don't think it's suspicious of her to stay friends with this guy. She might really like him as a friend and tbh most women have developed the art of turning someone down while still being friends because that's the only way to keep male friends. If you suspect she's actually cheating (lying about where she is, other types of stuff like that) then I can understand a bit more but your post makes it seem like you don't suspect her of cheating, only that you don't like that she didn't cut a dude off for having feelings for her.

I don't think YTA but also I don't think she is either. She never asked for this dude to have feelings for her (as far as it seems from what you've said) and just wants to stay friends with someone who clearly means a lot to her as a friend. You say that you don't want to talk to her about it because you'll seem insecure but you clearly are insecure. Just tell her ""listen, this is upsetting me and I don't want to be overly controlling and I don't want to hurt your feelings but it bothers me because Y"" and let her tell you ""I understand that but I'm choosing to date you because I love you and I'm into you. I'm actively choosing to be with you because you're the person I love so you don't have any reason to be insecure"""
9udcrd,NTA as far as I'm concerned. If you're going to be annoying at least fucking own it.
9udd9g,"NTA. Although there are better ways to respond, they kept coming up to you and pestering you."
9uddar,"NTA. Leave her, this whole situation she has created is toxic. The other guy will always be in the background. You were upfront with the conditions you were prepared to be with her for and they have been breached. "
9udfnt,NTA: dude I slept in a single bed for all four years of school in residence. I couldn’t imagine sharing that tiny bed every night. She’s overreacting and kinda being mean by calling you names and manipulating you. 
9udmc6,"NTA. Sounds like you communicated just fine, updating her as new info came out. 

Also, her telling you that she's going to stay unhappy until you come back seems kind of manipulative..."
9udo6x,Yeah that’s kinda shitty. You’re intentions were good but why would you bring her to a public place to do this? Asshole move.
9udzsg,"NTA. They’re guests in your house, speaking an entirely different language you can’t even join in on. Why do they need you there for the conversation if you can’t join? They aren’t children."
9ue5e5,"Nope, NTA. Your body, your rules, period. I assume you (or rather, your insurance) *paid* the dental office, so you don't owe them anything else (although helping them with their marketing might be a nice thing to do). "
9ueexx,"NTA - you stumbled on a secret she tried to hide. keep walking, and don't look back."
9ueio5,"Your bigger cost is probably from the washer and dryer if they are on your apartment's meter as well. If it is just the bulbs, pop in some LEDbulbs. You can run those 24x7 and they may cost you a dollar in electricity. You would be an asshole to just take out the bulbs as that would likely cause serious bodily harm to someone coming down the stairs with arms full of laundry in the dark."
9uensh,"YWBTA. You would be asking someone to not come to a public dog park. I also have an aggressive dog but, I realize it’s my responsibility to control her. 
It’s a public place, you can’t ask other people to not go there due to your specific needs. "
9ueve1,You're not an asshole for not being into anal. You are an asshole for thinking less of him for doing it in the past. He's not a different person now that you know. 
9uf5y9,"Nah, if she wants to study in that horrible way then let her. You’re not her parent and she needs to be responsible for herself"
9uf740,"NTA, it's your job and the person should have respected that.

Now, I'm curious and have a few questions. Is the issue that staff where you work are using Airdrop when they shouldn't be, and thus making private data open for anyone to see, or is it the standard to use Airdrop, with the fact that students are expected not to use it?

Because if it's the latter, that's dumb as fuck."
9uf992,"YTA. You weren’t sure about the date /before/ the morning of, yet you cancelled the day of. That’s asshole behavior. "
9ufc52,"I think it’s a lil weird that he jumped right to you after being rejected by your sister, but if you have feelings for him & she doesn’t, NTA. "
9ufe2a,"NTA for asking, YTA if you made a big deal about it, which I don't think you did.

&#x200B;

The thing to recognize is that McDonald's isn't like a mom and pop business where they have a simple balance book. When you factor in national coupons and inventory it's probably pretty complicated. "
9ufjou,"So, the problem here is if we go with your answer, my wife is going to win the argument. Could you do me a solid and slip in a ninja edit to, like, the opposite answer?"
9ufvlz,"My opinion, NTA. You care about her, and a quick update or two isn't too much to ask for. Provided you aren't looking for conversations that are too long, wanting to be supportive, as well as making sure she's okay, isn't *too* much to ask for. Heck, even a small text now and then should suffice, right? "
9ug1rr,I think YTA. You bought these tickets so now they’re your problem. 
9ug4gj,"You don't sound like an asshole, you sound frustrated. Your parents are also certainly frustrated, I think bringing attention to the situation is definitely more helpful than sweeping it under the rug and walking on eggshells around your sister. We have a similar situation with my aunt at the center, getting everyone else to discuss it calmly is a nightmare. I try to say things like ""How can we help her without enabling this behavior? Can we encourage her to find healthier outlets for her frustration?"" I try to keep the conversation about my aunt so that my other family members don't feel attacked, since my aunt does plenty of attacking on her own. I'm sorry you guys are going through this, I hope you've got easier days ahead. "
9uga5q,"I get why you're frustrated but better to try talking to the prof one on one about it first. It's the professor's job to manage the classroom, not yours."
9uge92,"I can't tell if I'm just really tired or of this story is extremely confusing and poorly worded. So you found out all this through your sister in law, who is his coworker? Anyway, if your TLDR is accurate, no you're not the asshole. Bro code bullshit doesn't apply to trying to fuck someone's wife. "
9ugifd,"YNTA for feeling that way, but you would be if you started to protest your brother coming home. That’s still your parents child, regardless of age. If he needs a place to stay then let him come home. Let your parents see themselves how lazy he truly is and make up their mind. That said NTA right now."
9ugilx,"YTA

&#x200B;

Leave her alone. You're only doing this because you feel shitty, so you're willing to make her feel uncomfortable for your own sake. "
9ugish,"YTA, only because this is about your cat, not you, and ending his suffering.  But you have a good heart, and I’m so sorry for your loss.  ❤️

Edit to say I feel awful about calling you an asshole, but it’s the nature of the sub.  You sound like a very good human."
9ugkst,"YNTA. Unfortunately life gets in the way. It would be nice to make an effort to see your mother, but if it will hinder your future that drastically, then you’ll have to see her next Christmas. Maybe do a compromise? Like have a Christmas in July with her?"
9ugl44,NTA. You put her feelings and future first because you were unsure of yours. If she’s still hurt there’s not much you can do to fix that except apologize and let her know you’re sorry for having to hurt her like that.
9ugphr,"NTA. If a person had to maintain close, active friendships with literally every person they tried to date, they would have no free time."
9uh69o,"NTA. Though she doesn't sound like she's in a good place right now. Have you tried just sitting down with her and having a serious talk about all this? Tears or not, power through it. If she doesn't want to listen, you aren't responsible for how she wants to live her life. "
9uhpy4,"NTA.  It's an awful situation all around, but you sent a card and a thoughtful gift for their daughter.  You're not obligated to pay for their medical bills, and you offered them your condolences.

You don't need to approve of their decision, but you can support them as a friend.  I can't imagine how someone could let their spouse go through birthing a child that won't live, but you can support them as people who have suffered from a loss.  If you feel like you need to do more, you could make dinner for them in a month.  People get bombarded with food at funerals but may end up feeling forgotten and lonely after some time has passed.  "
9uhst1,"YTA for making me read this screed that boils down to, ""I armchair psychoanalyzed a friend and pinpointed his mother as the problem faster than you could say Sigmund Freud."" Your chain of reasoning: He is depressed > because he is lonely > because he can't hold a relationship > because he is to narcissistic > because of his mom. That is quite the chain. 

&#x200B;

I think you jumped the gun with the mom, I think you honestly believe you are helping, but at this point the best you can do is 1) be there for your friend if they need  you and 2) leave the diagnosis and analysis to the professionals. "
9uhwid,"You aren't the arsehole. Family is who acts like it, not who is blood related to you, and that dude hasn't acted like family. Fuck him, and focus what you need to live happily."
9uhxtg,"YNTA. Just because someone is old does not give them the right to be a dick to everyone else. Thinking ""I'm old, my time is more precious!"" Well, what if the 15 people you just cut were all off to do busy things? Maybe one of the men was about to go on a date and propose? Maybe one is a surgeon and gonna be late for surgery"
9uhy3g,"YTA not only for repeatedly expecting your girlfriend to be bit by an aggressive dog, but also prioritizing an aggressive dog over a human relationship and safety.

What you should do is show this post to your GF so she can know EXACTLY how little you think of or care for her safety, that way she can find someone who actually gives a shit.

You already knew this dog was aggressive and you continued to put her in harms way for an aggressive dog. 100% TA.

And everyone making excuses for and aggressive dog and blaming the GF is TA too. "
9ui1ge,"It sounds like you're experiencing some increased irritability. It happens, and can result from any number of things. Are you getting enough sleep? Are there any other stressors in your life right now that could be wearing down on you? Is it possible that you might be depressed (for which increased irritability is a symptom)?

Regardless, NTA. It doesn't matter that your brother is autistic here; anyone could have annoying behaviors that you might be locking on to, abnormal or not. Look up some coping mechanisms for general irritability. Take care of yourself, OP. "
9ui375,No... I AM THE ASSHOLE because despite my general tolerance for lifestyle choices I just want furries to get the fuck away from the rest of us.
9ui455,"NTA for making out with her. YTA for making out when she was too drunk to handle herself. 
"
9uif5p,"Depends. Do you all contribute for all food and drink? Do you pay rent? Help with utilities? 

Because if I was covering most big expenses for people and they decided to lay claim to something small like soda, I'd be pretty pissed at the sense of entitlement too."
9uiobt,"NTA. You're under no obligation to date anyone for any reason, and you are not responsible for another's mental health. "
9uiqgl,"Ynta I think, if what you say is true then she's harassing people,  homeless or not that's not okay,  people shouldn't have to feel unsafe in a shopping centre"
9uir9b,"Lol no. None of that is true. I wouldn’t just lie. Here’s verbatim what I said, “The last several times I've been there, they just leave the meat out, rather than refrigerating it. When I bit into my sandwich, it was warm. I ended up getting very sick. I won't go back.” 

Edited to include verbatim review. "
9uistd,"You're NTA for reacting angrily, definitely the asshole for jumping around a moving car going 70+mph with other cars around. "
9uj1ok,"NTA.

And I’m concerned that you think you might be in this situation, dude. You did absolutely nothing wrong. "
9uj2uq,"YTA for doing it because you wanted to hurt her. 

You got rejected. It happens. She didn't owe you a date. "
9uj3ei,"YTA. And you approached this all wrong. You should have started by asking him to just be careful, get on him for not being careful, sure. But it sounds like you CAN live with it and that you are being a bit selfish by asking him to just cut it out. "
9ujhtm,"NTA. I wouldn't say you're the asshole, but yeah man that's how depression works. You doubt everything in your dark moments then realize it's all irrational in your good moments. It's shitty but you shouldn't have to deal with someone flipping the switch on you like that. It is manipulative, even if it's not intentional. 

YTA for breaking up over the phone though. "
9uk845,NTA about the trip. Kicking you out is a dick move. You need to get used to everything else though. She's going to be family soon and kind of already is. Make an effort to politely ask her not to interrupt you.
9ukadj,"YTA, but not for the reason you think.

It's pretty clear that while the ceremony doesn't mean that much to you, it means something to your parents. 

You graduating is, for them, a big sign that they're helping you have a better life.

Honestly, I'd do it for them."
9ukagw,"NTA. This smells fishy, and was possibly some type of scam that would have ended up with you getting taken advantage of and/or robbed. 
"
9ukjhd,"Yeah, you're the asshole.

You signed the rest of your class's names to something without their consent. That's an asshole move."
9ul08r,"YTA. You make it very clear you don’t respect this girl, if you ever did before. You only ever talk about who she’s flirting with and a WHOLE lot of assumptions about what she’s feeling, thinking, or trying to accomplish every time she enters a room. You don’t like the way she treats people? Don’t associate with her. 

As far as I can tell, your every assumption about her wanting any sort of relationship past friendship is just that, an assumption. She talked loudly behind you.  She acted nice / pissy at different intervals. So what. 

Seems like every situation she’s in with you you assume 90% of her actions are revolving around you. Manipulating you, trying to spite you, trying to make you like her. 

Sounds like her life isn’t together. I’m sorry for her that you’re in it. There’s no ‘friend zone’ you denied. She opened up to you but didn’t want a relationship, and that makes you an ‘emotional tampon’? Must really suck, wow. 

Get over yourself. "
9ul17j,"NTA. I think you really need to sit your room mate down and have a chat. Let him know you're happy for him but you feel like you're a guest in your own home and that you'd like a few nights a week just to have some quiet, use the TV and relax. Ask of he minds maybe staying at his girlfriends house one or two nights a week.

If she's staying there all the time is she contributing to the house or at least making food for you as well? "
9ul86i,[deleted]
9ul8kg,"NTA, your sex life is between the two of you, and is not anyone else's business.  If you dont want to share details he should respect that."
9ulfm9,"I don’t think you’re the asshole but I could see how this could come off in a negative way to your professor. This question would more be geared towards admission counselors. So I guess it wouldn’t be the most helpful to other students. 

You could email your professor back with a new question and agree that you think the question wasn’t the best for a faculty panel. 

Many students do transfer after freshman year, and transferring schools does usually cause a drop in GPA for a while. You could say you were trying to better understand the negative effects of transferring. "
9ulivo,"NTA but tread carefully. You are living in their house and by the sounds of it if you decide to say no, which is your right, they may retaliate. Consider it your rent, even though you get it back. If they start to not pay you back then there’s a bigger issue"
9uln4y,"Yeah.
Your friend told you his idea and you gave it away. Possibly not on purpose, but you did.
Then when he was upset about it you told him his feelings didn't matter because he couldn't do it anyway. How shitty.

"
9ultb4,"Well I think it's fair to say that you are both assholes. He's an asshole because he seems to be bossing people about when he has no right.

You're an asshole for being arrogant as fuck. You seemed to forget how fortunate you are and how unfortunate he may have been. Even if he had the same oppurtunities it would still be an incredibly cruel thing to say. There's an argument that you were provoked, but to tell someone that you'll do much more with your life because you're going to college is a horrible thing to say, even if it's true. 

There are many better ways to deal with that situation. My suggestion would be to refuse everything he demands of you (unless it's very reasonable). You say he has no power... but if you're doing what he says then he obviously does have power. If you act like he has power then he will keep acting like he has power. You could decide to stop playing his games or keep playing along if it makes him happy. Maybe talk to the owner about it - ask him to clarify the hierarchy and peoples roles/responsibilities. If you know the owner is aware he has no real power then whenever he asks you to do something tell him if he has any complaints with the life guards he can contact the reception by phone.

If someone with no power was bossing me around at my job I wouldn't do a thing they said. Some people need to be kept in check and taken down a peg."
9um28m,"Probably yes.
I would have done the same though."

9uma3n,"I’d say no you’re not the asshole. She flaked on you basically. I think you prob should’ve told her beforehand “hey since I haven’t heard anything from you about this concert I’m making other plans for that night” but you’re still not the asshole. If she expects someone to pay for an event, she should’ve been on top of it and not blown you off. If we didn’t want to be responsible, she doesn’t get that money back. You did what you could in this situation, in my opinion. You were within your right to think she decided not to go through with it. It’s on her. Don’t pay her, and let her know it’s her fault for being so flakey. "

9ungp9,"She broke plans she had with you, so your not an asshole. But, your description of events and your situation make you sound needy and whiny. She chose to spend time with a happy friend in person, vs. talking on the phone to her anxious depressed boyfriend. I can see how that would be tempting. Get your head straight and don't put the responsibility of your mental health on her. I hope you get things straightened out. Good luck."

9uo9wy,"NTA. I live a university town and drive alongside bikes every day. Sometimes they do annoying and stupid things.

9uoc93,NTA. They are the assholes for not knowing boundaries between you and them.

Money was made to make trade easier so you don't have to go around trading some firewood for some eggs or beef.

All of that and building up your friend's hope and actually thinking she got the job is just cruel and not funny in the slightest."
9up0iu,"It sounds like you could have explained the situation without exploding on her like that. You held in the anger too long when a few calm words between would have been good enough to get your point across. Besides that YNTA, you handled it poorly though.

You're not wrong that it's spending taxpayer money in a way that doesn't exactly seek to get consensus for the cost. It's one of those things with no real right answer. 

You could fight for no taxpayer money to be spent on it. I'm not sure I'd pick that fight though - right or not, a great deal of people will see you as a jerk."

9upl8d,YTA dude. Totally. I mean you didn’t say how the person harassed you but from the info here you’re childish and petty and even more so you got someone in trouble for something they didn’t do. That’s some real shitty shit to do.
9upuqp,"You are NTA.

Some serious suggestions. Document her behavior in case you need to file a restraining order or in case she accuses you of a crime. Go to couples counseling with your spouse. Your wife grew up with this and will need help seeing the light. The counselor's visit notes also function as documentation. Immediately inform your daycare that your MIL is restricted from picking up or visiting your child. Do not compromise on this. Be aware that Florida is a two-party consent state for recording conversations. You should record any conversation you have with MIL, but you must inform her in order to avoid legal trouble. Recording texts/emails does not require consent, of course. Make sure MIL has no access to any of your financial accounts. If she does anything remotely criminal immediately file a police report. If she attempts to impersonate you or your wife, if she refuses to leave your property when asked, if she harassed you or threatens you, etc. Basically, imagine any way she can screw you over and protect yourself. Good luck. "
9uq04o,Sounds like some friendly banter you guys aren’t competing for a spot / scholarship right? If not then I wouldn’t be annoyed.

9uqcpp,">Why is weed not being legal racist? 

There's relatively little difference between marijuana use among races, but minorities are arrested or punished for it at a disproportionate rate.

I mean, even customer service tells you to wait at least 24 hours for a response and they're getting paid to answer your mail."

9us6p9,"You don't owe her shit. If she's faking depression then fuck her. She's insulting people with real diagnosed depression by doing that. 

That being said it's sometimes faking depression can ironically be a sign of real depression.

Side note though. People ""brag"" about being gay because they had to hide it throughout their whole lives. They were discriminated and insulted for being gay, and they had to deal with a lifetime of pretending to be straight. 

Now that LGBTQIA issues are being more accepted, let them celebrate. It's not pride in being gay. It's pride in being able to express and freely say that they're gay without negative connotations."

No! Why don't you just write out what you actually said to him instead if trying to make us do mental gymnastics.

Fucking - Just say it. It's just a word.

9usbee,"This isn't sex compatibility issue, It's you were moving/going too fast for relationship that's a month old and she was uncomfortable about it. So yeah, you are an asshole for being too physical in a short time/3-4 weeks."
9usdcy,"Honestly, I don’t think you’d be an asshole for going. Your mom might think you are, but I think most adults would go to the party and say, if your mom confronts you,” Mom, I know that you and Grandma don’t get along. I don’t think either of you are innocent. I still love Grandma and this is a milestone birthday for her. I love you both, but I want you to know that I’m not going to choose between the two of you.” 

I think you’re a rockstar for wanting to still go, but also caring about your mom’s feelings!"
9usgo0,"Erm. I'm probably going to be unpopular on this... But as a new dad who recently went through a pregnancy that wasn't smooth... NTA.

I get that she wants to do this for her friend. But holy hell pregnant women are the worst. And I say that with the best will in the world. But they have medical issues you wouldn't believe, they have to be careful and boring and their hormones are all crazy. It's not their fault. But when you're in public and your pregnant partner starts a fight over something stupid and you're tired because you were both up with her being sick in the night. You bet you'll look like the asshole arguing with a pregnant woman. Doesn't matter how right you are.

Plus... Childbirth is not as safe as we all think it is. 

My wife and baby both nearly died and it's not even like it's uncommon! Yes medicine has come a long way, but to be a surrogate, your gf is literally putting her life on the line for this guy. 

I was happy to be there for my wife when she was carrying my child... But I can't honestly say I'd be up for all that drama if it wasn't mine.

Also. This shit doesn't just all go away after the birth! Post natal depression is really really common. 

Jesus I could go on."
9uslfq,"Neither of you is the asshole. You're quite possibly incompatible.

A peck on the lips between close friends/family is *very* common in many cultures. It can be completely platonic.

"
9ut6ss,"NTA unless the way you phrased what you said was dramatically different than what you've said here.  It's unfortunate that she's stressing about it, but since you have experience in this area and were only offering to help, you were doing the best you could for her.  If she thinks she is stressed now, wait until she has to put a plan into motion that hasn't been well thought out."
9ut8nu,[deleted]
9utm00,"NTA in my books.  You're not the one that's causing her to be cut out of your life, she is.  Despite the love you say she has for you, she still acts in such a way as to continually remove herself from your life.  Getting arrested right in front of you should be the last straw.  Unless she can prove to you that's she really, truly changed, I don't consider you under any obligation to hold on to a relationship that she's destroying."

Even if it shows as deleted client-side, it's highly likely that on the server side it still exists *especially* in a chat room service where potential sexual predators can use it to groom for sexual abuse as this lecturer seems to be doing.

9uyha1,No you're not the asshole. This is a hard situation for you but you're not the parent you're the child. You have to live your life and be happy. I get the guilt though I'd feel it too but you can't spend the rest of your life looking after your mother. When do you get to live? 
9uyjla,NTA. You obviously care about him and are watching for the warning signs of alcoholism. Chances are if he grew up amongst alcoholics he has no real idea what a healthy relationship with alcohol is like.

>I love my life and I feel that either candidate will not affect me in the slightest.

The decisions of who wins *will* affect people.  Possibly people you love or care about.  Definitely people who live in your community.  Your stance is essentially saying, ""I only care about how my decisions affect *me*, and screw everyone else.""

You aren't entitled to help people, but make it clear if that's the last time you are going to help them if they skip frequently. If he fails it's his fault and his fault alone though, Im not saying any blame is on you. "
9uzg28,Yes you are. You smacked the shit out of him over Pokemon cards. You're an adult. He's 8. Do you not see the gravity of the situation? 
9uzjzd,"Yes YTA for 2 reasons.

First reason, if a customer came back trying to find their lost money and go to managers about it, the managers will see you picking up the lost cash and pocketing it on the security camaeras, then fire you for not turning in lost money.

Second reason, the money isn't yours and you should had turned it in incase the person who lost it came back looking for it.

9v080s,"NTA. I’m an artist so I have a bit of opposite perspective on this. The artist should cater to you, you should not have to cater to them. They’re the ones selling a product, they should be responsible enough to not take on a commission if they’re too busy to handle it. They also need to tell you if something’s come up and give you an estimate of about how long it’ll take to get your piece done. You’re totally innocent here."
9v088t,"Nta. I feel like a lot of commenters here are missing that this is your kids birthday party that your in laws just kind of took over.

I'd agree that you cant make these requests at a normal party, but I think it's fair to have a say in your own kids birthday guest list "
9v0mvl,"NTA, you’ve gave them numerous chances to correct their dog’s barking. They just don’t care.

You’ve been fairly reasonable and they’re continuing to break their lease by having a noise nuisance. You’re not “getting them evicted”, they’re getting themselves evicted for repeatedly ignoring the request from the landlord to correct the issue. "
9v0tg7,"NTA, not in the slightest.

It’s generally rude to have a second baby shower, but it’s ESPECIALLY rude to be thrusted into the role of hostess. That’s something people volunteer for, not the parents-to-be assign to others.

If it’s his first child, I can get some of his excitement over it and wanting to have a shower, but you still don’t throw people into the role who never asked to be there. If it’s not his first child, that just layers on the tackiness.

I don’t blame you in the slightest for not wanting to do something you were thrusted in to doing. Just gracefully bow out. "
9v0v1g,YTA. If you’re an atheist just be an atheist. If you feel the need to lie about your religion to win an argument you seriously need to rethink if you should even be arguing the point in the first place.

9v1mzg,"That seems strange to me, I would never assume that me going travelling for a month would exempt me from paying the costs of my rental property while I was away.  Here at least, many utilities have a base charge (like a service fee), and stuff like internet is a fixed monthly charge irrespective of how many people use it.  Realistically, one person being away doesn’t reduce the costs proportionally, and if you are a tenant, you shouldn’t leave your housemates with a higher bill than they expected when they moved in, just because you’re off on holiday for a month or whatever.

9v2qo1,"You've already gotten your answer, but a little tip for the future is to avoid assessing amounts to owed favors. For example, since he paid for your drink, you should agree that you owe him ""a drink"". If you buy someone a meal at a restaurant, they owe you a meal at that restaurant or another restaurant at a similar price. In high school, my friends and I would keep track of our dues with restaurant terms ""I owe you Taco Bell"" ""You owe me Starbucks"" and in college, it's more vague, ""I owe you a drink"" ""You owe me dinner.""

&#x200B;

The specifics are up to you, but keeping numbers out of favors helps way more than it sounds. "

9v3aot,"Ummmmm, absolutely fucking not. She sounds like a raging cunt, and I'm sorry that you even had to ask that question, because that is so ridiculously unfair. The whole ""rape makes women stronger"" should have shown everyone what a raging cunt she is. People are entitled to shitty opinions I suppose, but you're also entitled to decide who you want to surround yourself with. I hope you and your husband get it figured out! ❤️ "
9v3drw,"NTA, how would he even know if you were or weren't there (at the time I mean)?  He's under anesthesia the whole time.  You being there wouldn't have made any practical difference.  He can be angry all he wants, that's his prerogative, but it's your choice whether you want to be there or not."
9v3du4,"Yes, you'd be the asshole at this point. You had plenty of good reasons to say no in the first place, but this isn't the first place. You also had ample opportunity to ask where the wedding would be when you first heard about it. Only finding out now is on you and your wife, not anyone else.

I wouldn't want strangers' kids in my wedding either, but these are a family friend's grandkids and they're probably pretty cute. It's not up to you or me, and *these* people want your MIL's grandkids to take part. You could have politely and respectfully said no before now, but five days before the wedding is way too late not to be an asshole. Sorry. Maybe MIL can take the kids to the rehearsal."
9v3nkc,"YTA. that's super fucked up. You went around spreading personal information about her that she told you in confidence because she didn't want to be your friend anymore. Sounds like she felt you were juding her and from the tone of this post, I bet she was right. If she was such a train wreck you didn't need to drag her through the mud. If your friends have two eyes they'll see the situation for what it is, didn't need you bad mouthing her as well. "

9v43bs,"NTA, but next time tell them in advance. I’ve done this before by accident and had to be like “Hey, just so you know I’m not exactly in a place for commitment right now.

Best of luck!"
9v4byn,"> she owes me the communication of whether or not she’s coming home and when she expects to be home (AITA there?).

Your house, your rules. NTA.

If you change the locks, NTA towards your ex, but YTA towards the son who is unfortunately in the middle of this situation. This would be easy if not for her son because as you said, her son did nothing wrong and makes it a difficult decision. It sounds like you're expected to be his daycare. You have to find a safe way to offload your responsibility for the kid. I don't personally have experience with CPS but maybe that is an option?"

9v4dhf,"You are 100% the asshole here. Your teacher is just trying to do her job and you are, quite frankly, a little bitch. You’re incredibly obnoxious, disrespectful and I wouldn’t be surprised to find out you had a real superiority complex. Your behavior in her class is disgusting. You don’t have to like your teachers but you do need to show them the *bare minimum* of respect. 

You sound like the poster child for ‘kids that would be done a world of good if they were thrown into boot camp for a week’. Learn that sometimes you just have to suck it up and pretend you’re having fun, or you’re going to sink like a stone in the real world. All the knowledge in the world won’t do you any good if you can’t function like a mature adult when you’re with people you don’t like.

I recommend apologizing again. Write a note to show that you really do care. It’s likely that with the way you’ve been acting, you’ve already burned all your bridges with her, but you should at least make an effort to lesson the discord between you two. In the end, this will be a regrettable period in your life for you, and she’ll at least have a cautionary tale to tell her future students about"

To add, if you’re looking for employment in the same field you’ll need this family as a good reference.

Thus, just becausd you have problems understanding her now does *not* mean it would be a problem in a long term relationship.- So, while your reason is understandable, if you like the girl otherwise you may end up throwing away a chance for somwthing good based on a percieved problem which could turn out to be trivial in the long run."

9v8odj,Take a hint buddy
9v8umv,"Yes, you are.  

Your son is as much yours as he is your boyfriend’s

You and your boyfriend grew up in different households with different rules , under different  circumstances.  Doesn’t mean your way was better than his. You’re forcing your boyfriend to abide by all of your rules while not letting your boyfriend add anything to the parenting choices.  

You seem controlling and convinced that your way is the only way. 


There are millions of ways to raise children.  Kids will get hurt, they’ll bump their heads, chip their teeth...   grandparents will spoil them.  They’ll grab stuff off the floor they aren’t supposed to, etc etc.  

Trust that your boyfriend and his family love your son, and that everything will be ok.    Don’t be so controlling. You’re not giving anyone any favours doing so (as much as you mean well. 

I’m not saying you should let him do whatever he wants.  But try to bend a little, and he should do the same.  Meet somewhere half way. 

Lastly, what would your response be if roles were reversed? If you wanted to go away for the day with your son and he refused? Would you be pissed?  Would his opinion even matter?   

"

9v9fl7,"NTA what he's doing is pretty damn weird. But his reaction is warranted **from his perspective**, not any normal person's. He still shouldn't be dating a 15 year old. If he doesn't forgive you, fuck it.

9vb76o,"YNTA - you were honest with him about how you orgasm even before you got together, as long as you were honest and not cruel which it doesn’t sound like you were, you can’t help if his ego is hurt.  You were trying to make sex better and because he has a fragile ego he instead lashed out at you.  "
9vbgqo,"YNTA. What you're asking is totally reasonable.  


 But here's the thing, you're also probably not going to win this one. She's suffering from an eating disorder and alcoholism, and in treatment 10 hours a day... I'd imagine she has no scope of focus outside of that.   


It's admirable what you're doing, and it's also admirable that you married someone that you knew was an alcoholic/had an eating disorder.

9vc3t0,Nta. Last year our company was bought out and we knew there would cut backs. Its a fight corporation. Everyone in my facility was very nervous. We employee about 3000 employees where im at. The one thing this new corruption did was postpone all admin bonuses and throw a huge employee party. They also made sure we all knew the truth; the cut backs and lay off were a possibility but employee moral was of utmost importance and theyve stood true to that. Thats one one of the key reasons ive stayed
9vcdjk,"I’m not sure I understand the problem - they’re multiple choice questions, but you’re writing in the answer instead of picking one of the choices?

Part of the ease of multiple choice is that the professor can quickly and easily asses if you have the correct answer or not - a major advantage of you have hundreds of students. It may seem petty, but if you aren’t doing the assignment correctly, then you might be the asshole.  That 5% is likely your professor’s way of asking you to pay attention to what you’re doing. "
9vci7z,">So when i had my phone back i checked it, no missed calls or anything just some texts and snaps, one of the texts being from her at 2pm: ""When are you coming?"". So i thought like if she’s not calling or anything although we said that or to ask why i didn’t text i just thought i‘m just gonna finish my assignments and study some more. 

She texts asking when you're coming and you choose to ignore her because she didn't start pestering you for an answer? Were you butt hurt that she only texted you the one time? O.o"
9vcpvv,"NTA. Not only is that friend disrespecting the relationship, but your girlfriend seems to be disrespecting your boundaries to follow her own interest (making friends.) 

I would try to talk about it with her before you do anything. Unfortunately, you can’t really control what she does but if she decides to go after something that makes her partner genuinely upset and uncomfortable, it says something about her... "

9vdnx4,"You describe yourself as explosive. You're only 18, and apparently you were ""incredibly difficult"" up until age 15. You also describe how you cussed at your sister and aggressively grabbed something back from her over something you weren't even correct about, as she wasn't in your room.

> I believe my family knows I like to lash out a little bit and they should accept that. If I do lash out, they can just tell me because I don't have bad intentions and id appreciate them stopping me right away.  

This is really sad. ""I suck, and I know I suck, but since we all know it, they need to get over it."" Also, what do you mean you don't have ""bad intentions."" No, you just acted on those bad intentions unconsciously. It's natural to you, so you don't see it as purposefully doing something bad. You just do it out of instinct.

9ve1hr,"YTA. Anytime you have sex, you run the risk of an unplanned pregnancy. Anytime you pressure someone into altering their body, you're being an asshole.

I don't blame you for being frightened of parenthood, but if she was clearly ready for motherhood, you had no business using guilt, shame, or coercion in order to manipulate her.

She doesn't want to talk about it with you because you were the partial cause of her depression. I wouldn't want to discuss my pain with the person who caused it either, not when there is nothing to be done to make it right again. "
9vef9l,"NTA. BUT, instead of lashing out at the guy himself you should turn your attention to your sister and comforting her. You calling him out on the obvious ain't really gonna fix anything. I am not saying you don't have a right to be angry and confront him, I am saying that energy could be better spent elsewhere. But the ""I was drunk"" excuse is a classic bullshit excuse. But take comfort in the thought that so many others are giving him shit for it as well and still are. The confrontation was unnecessary, but you weren't in the wrong here.

>I'd like it to be 2-3 each week and think it's just a matter of effort; if she loved me it'd come naturally. 

That statement is fucked up on several levels. 

>She also has issues with anxiety and depression. I've been depressed too and I think she just needs to get outside and do things more often to get better, but she says she's comfortable at the computer, knitting (what 20 year old knits?) or drawing/colouring in (which is childish and needs to stop). 

You're condescending of her hobbies and you OBVIOUSLY don't understand depression, or if you do you just don't give a fuck about hers. 

>I suggested smiling more and sending me photos and texts of her doing happy things. 

She's supposed to fake being happy? 

>Honestly though, I'm not sure if this relationship is a good idea. I don't know if I fear being stuck with her or losing her more. She's been crying that I've been killing her and need to make a decision, but I think shes overreacting to the situation and doesn't seem that worried about losing me or she'd have put in more effort. 

You're right it's not a good idea and you should end it. Or at least let her end it, without all the guilt like she wants too anyway."

9vf6kc,"Possibly unpopular opinion and I'm going to say you ATA... we (I'm 22) grew up with technology/internet in ways our parents didn't. As much as my mother loves her Facebook and internet, she (50) cannot grasp basic concepts no matter how many times my sister and I explain to her. My dad on the other hand is 55 and learns these things VERY quickly. We all get annoyed at having to explain and repeat ourselves constantly to my mother....but you can't expect her to grasp everything as easily as you. It's like being angry at someone learning a foreign language or something. 

As someone else said, encourage her to take notes and remind her you won't always be around to help when she needs it. But for the time being, just remember many of these things are still new to her just like many things will be new to you and you may still find yourself asking her for help from time to time. "

The idea itself was just sick and twisted.

AND he pushed you, which made you fall on the kitten. So you didn’t purposefully kill it, it was an accident, and the blame is more on your friend.

9vk240,"You're not the asshole, and if your friend doesn't change course, you might want to re-think the word ""friend."" Let's re-frame what he's doing. He can't get laid, which is at least partially his fault in some way, because it always is, so instead of trying to improve himself so he can attract actual women, he's going for an 18 year old kid. This is because 18 year olds are very impressionable, and his age and experience allow him to exert a manipulative influence over her that simply doesn't fly with real women his age. It's predatory no matter what anyone tells you. Really, if he's truly unable to attract a woman unless she's basically a high schooler, it says a lot about his overall capabilities as an adult man."

In my opinion they're looking for a cheap part time worker who works more than fulltime (Not in hours but in tasks) and gets close to no hours payment.
Try to find a better job where you don't have to beg for the appropiate time/ amount of work and stop them from exploiting your diligent working attitude to save money on hours. "

9vkvq9,"ABSOLUTELY NOT! They are breaking the rules of the road doing that. It's not reckless driving that causes the most accidents, it's people behaving erratically like this. It's when people start making small little changes to the flow of traffic... that's when shit gets super dangerous. You always want to make sure that people know or can easily guess exactly what's going to happen before it happens. Then when super polite Susan starts changing things on the fly, even if it's to be a good neighbor, that's when sketchy shit starts to go down. Even if it's just enough to make people stop and go ""something's not right"" that's enough of a delay for shit to go down. Pedestrians might give a pause. The guy behind you might not be ready. 

Sure, in this exact scenario, it'd be rare for things to go disastrously wrong, but this kind of thinking on the road or the highway is really bad. Waiting overly long to yield... forcibly slowing your lane down, even if everyone is speeding... letting that guy do a last minute hail mary merge when he shouldn't... these cause accidents!"
9vl2bs,YTA. Leave the girl alone. You broke up a long relationship with her over a **text message**. She was probably pissed at you and lost all respect for you. Then you come back later and she tells you to leave her alone. So leave her alone. Doing it again will just be harassment. 
9vl3ac,"NTA. This is just a genuine conflict of views. 

Assuming you are in the US and believe that your relationship will continue for the foreseeable future, there are 2 reasons to get married. First is that marriage conveys important legal rights and privileges on the couple. The second is that marriage had important financial and tax benefits. "
9vlb6p,"Not the asshole. But in this situation you should have given her an ultimatum beforehand instead of cutting her off right before a big test without warning her that you would cut her off. That's only if you care to not appear as the bad guy to a bunch of selfish high schoolers. If you don't care, then you made the right choice. 

I had a friend like her. I warned him that ""this is the last time I'm helping you out"". He took my help that time and really put in work after that because he didn't want to fail. I would have never just cut him off with no warning, as he was my friend. "
9vll0v,Not the asshole. You're not getting paid for almost hour long conversations. You have a job and so does he. But perhaps he's a little miffed and maybe needs someone to tell him that personal chats should be kept to break time.

Plenty of people have chronic illnesses and still make an income, others adapt their work to their lives. They still contribute despite feeling like death and having a mind/body that malfunctions without warning.

It sounds like she's gotten cushy with being supported and doesn't realise/care that it's a problem. She needs a wake up call.


*A.N: I have a bunch of chronic issues I just don't talk about because it gets old to complain about things that don't change.

Even I don't believe you were just buying the condom just to possess it. And no, you were not being tested. She straight up told you she wasn't interested. I'd suggest moving on. I'll post a few unethical tips to avoid awardness around school now. 

1. Turn the condom into a water ballon and throw it at James. 
2. Buy another condom from flynn, just keep buying them, take the heat off.

9vvdns,"If none of the things she's making an effort to change affect you, then YTA. All your examples of her trying to improve herself are things that only impact her life while you seem to think her getting mad at you for dropping plates is ridiculous."
9vvrya,NTA at all. Some people don't react well to growing apart. 
9vvskq,"NTA, she broke your trust. It’ll take work to get it back "
9vvuav,"NTA, but I’m conflicted. If this is the path he chose in life, well 🤷‍♀️ He made his decision. I think you refusing to find his employment complaints valid isn’t cool, because of the whole “my situation is worse so you have nothing to complain about argument” but overall, you can choose to avoid someone, it’s fine."
9vwino,Not even a little bit.
9vwq77,"NTA.

The other guy’s the asshole. I mean really, who kicks up a stink over someone saying hello? An asshole, thats who. "
9vx36l,"You're both assholes. They should have paid you and you shouldn't have gone into their space without their knowledge. I would be super freaked out if my roommate was snooping around my room.

I do think your compromise was good. They pretty much dismissed your apology and saying you wouldn't go into their room like that again, though. "
9vxd1t,"You sound complacent, you wanna try his food then ask. Don’t expect anything, especially when food is imvolved"
9vxedc,YTA. How much effort does it take to say hi???
9vxr9a,"I don't let randoms take pictures of me for any reason

NTA."
9vxroq,Why can't they just smoke outside?
9vy4z5,"NTA. Let her know your plans, explain that you want spend time with her but also have plans to hang out with friends, if she is planning on sleeping and you are planning on not sleeping then I don't see the problem. You do have to be careful though, some ladies might be offended by this if you had previously planned to spend the WHOLE night together. Honesty is always the best policy."
9vyaoq,"Not the asshole - and perhaps naive for thinking he’ll respect your position on this, given his past behavior. 


But - given that you have *repeatedly* attempted to resolve this through honest and direct communication with your roommate - there’s another approach that might solve the problem. **This approach would be a total asshole move if you hadn’t already made multiple attempts to resolve this maturely.** 


Your problem exists because you are being persistently respectful towards someone who is being persistently disrespectful towards you. 


The next time you walk in on them having sex *solely because he didn’t have the decency to text you as agreed*, **don’t leave**. Assume that they are cool with you being there and proceed as normal. That includes making phone calls, eating, cleaning, listening to music, even having friends over - pretend that they simply aren’t there. 


You are in this mess because you’re being more concerned about their privacy than *they* are. Cut that out - if they refuse to let you know that they need or want privacy when they have sex, assume they don’t need or want privacy.


As for their having sex while you’re there ... FFS, don’t close your eyes and try to imagine you’re somewhere else. Get up, turn on some lights, and grab some snacks. Heck, offer suggestions and encouragement. 


> Roomie, you need to spend sufficient time on foreplay - more time above the belt before going for the finish line. I can set a timer for you? We don’t want you to neglect anything. 


> Good work, guys, but you might find the reverse cowgirl a more enjoyable position - and it’ll give you a chance to catch your breath! Roomie, some regular cardio will improve your stamina - want to hit the gym with me tomorrow? 



You’ll find that they get better manners *very* quickly. "
9vybej,"NTA. Definitely DO NOT cut contact with your friends because your bf says so. I did it when i was 17 and stupid, and I still regret it.
Instead, maybe set some very clear boundaries with your ex and maybe sometimes include your boyfriend in your hangouts? My current bf was a bit jealous of this close male friend of mine, but hasn't been since he met him."
9vybrh,"YTA for telling someone on crutches to hurry up (could've said excuse me) and the kid is an asshole for hitting you with crutches.

You're not the asshole for defending yourself"
9vyfdn,NTA - youth sport aggro nutjobs are a special category of crazy and must be treated as such. reffing hockey sounds like fun though.
9vyht2,"I don’t think you’re the asshole for being fed up, but I think you are if you take it out on her. Remaining empathetic and communicative is probably the best thing that the two of you can continue to do for each other. "
9vyi45,NTA; she should have just accepted you for your beliefs and if she did that than why would you want to speak to her?
9vyiov,Why would you need to be babysat just from smoking weed? 
9vz510,"NTA. Sounds like an immature jackass. Even so, next time, just confront the issue head on rather than semi-ghosting him. Just better for everyone all around."
9vzhsd,"YTA. You badgered them into playing the lottery with you and when they won, you got upset. Why do you feel as though you are you entitled to the money? Is it because you introduced them to gambling? 

Let me ask you this: if they did NOT win, would you feel responsible to help pay for their lottery tickets/lost money? 

If that's your personality, so be it. But to avoid this situation in the future, I would recommend a lottery pool. That way nobody wins more than their friends and you won't feel envious."
9vzhvf,"You can’t be an asshole for trying to help out a friend. She may not like receiving what she perceived as charity, but regardless it’s a nice gesture. "
9vzxwo,YTA for wasting other people's money on an idiot who isn't going to get a vasectomy.
9w098x,"NTA, he should have asked. You might have decided to do it anyway, but it was YOUR decision to make, not his. You sound perfectly reasonable in your thoughts here. I think that your dad needs to realize that you are a separate autonomous being who is in charge of making their own decisions."
9w0eho,Nta your baby your rules.
9w0i7c,"NTA if you privately approch the friend tomorrow and wish them a happy birthday, thank them for the invite to the party, and then apologize and explain that you simply could not afford a gift. Any reasonable friend should understand as long as you are upfront and honest about it."
9w0k1o,"I fuckin hate the dude for so many reasons, but I agree with you. It's like when Obama got all that flak for wearing that one suit, or eating his hotdog (burger?) wrong or whatever.

That's the news of gossip columns and those trashy grocery store magazines. Do **not** elect a goddamn president based on their method of hotdog consumption, **do** get outraged at putting children into concentration camps.

  


NTA."
9w0nuj,"NTA. Make a complaint. Almost every community prohibits excessive, unnecessary, and unreasonable noise. The police will enforce these laws. "
9w0vxs,"I mean obviously it is really terrible for her, but I feel like the other commenters conveniently forgot the part where she was frequently violent towards you. You even specified that she had lapsed back into that behaviour after you took her back. Do they think you should just put up with that shit because you’re a man or something? I wouldn’t want to stay with somebody who did that to me, and I would feel uncomfortable having them around my child as well. It’s a very difficult situation for everyone involved so I’m going to say NTA."

"
9w1am2,">  I guess I was just raised to believe mental illness is something people  held in internally and weren’t “supposed” to be vocal about. 

This is why you're the asshole. This is SPECIFICALLY why you're the asshole. Personally, I think the girl is a tool. i know everyone handles trauma differently but her poem sounds reeeally pretentious. But yeah. You're the asshole and there's why."

9w1fcc,"Nah, same here. Driver gets music privilege, if they have a problem tell them to drive themselves."
9w1hxl,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

So basically a little while ago I found my father did some illegal things then divorced my mother then got sent to jail while i was about 2-3, I didn’t find out anything until I was 18.

 Before I found out I would call him/text him daily and try and fix our relationship, but ever since I found out I just can’t think of him without getting mad. And now he won’t call/text me (I don’t even know if he knows that I know about his past) 

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
9w1n8t,"Yes, you are the asshole for using gay slurs, both in a general sense, and against your brother. 

The fact that you feel it is ok in any context should trigger some self-evaluation. "
9w1nv7,"Wtf lol, NTA they left the lid off and you tried to clean it and he got mad."
9w1s1z,"I don't think it makes a difference that its a girl, but I guess I'll go with NTA because play stupid games, win stupid prizes

edit: removed all the edits. Fuck that girl, if she won't apologize to you then you shouldn't apologize, her friends are dicks for coming up to you later and beating you up when she was clearly in the wrong as well, final judgement, NTA"
9w2cyt,"I mean on one hand he could have used the other bathroom, but on the other hand you don't physically have to be in the bathroom to brush your teeth.  Like just turn your back to the bathroom for 30 seconds.  You're acting like you're chained to the sink for the duration of brushing your teeth.

I think you're both assholes for being this impatient over something so minor after 8 years together.  "
9w2nlw,"Nah, that's pretty normal and healthy. These days if I do get depressed the last thing in the world I would want us to be surrounded by more depressed people.

You sought help because you wanted to live a better life. Associating with people who run the risk of validating your negative thoughts can put you back a few steps."
9w2qjy,"Agreeing to disagree is one thing, but insulting is another.

If you don't feel good in someone's company, totally not the NTA to want to cut the friendship."
9w2sl1,Your last paragraph (after edit) sounds like you are wanting advice more than judgement. I an sure there is a sub for this. Maybe a pregnancy one? I will not pass judgement and have no advice that hasn't already been given. 
9w341r,Sounds like she has a yeast infection
9w3bq4,"NTA, She is a horrible person. You have the right of not seeing  her and she deserve that."
9w3fv4,And as harsh and crazy as this may sound. Don’t be a huge fucking asshole and stop speaking to your friend and then off yourself. It will make it worse for them. Cutting people off like that makes you a horrible person. Keep reaching out to get more of what you need. If you stopped speaking to your friend you’re just making it worse. 
9w3n49,"Are you seriously asking? Like, are you genuinely conflicted about whether you're an asshole are not, and you need the help of others to pick apart and weigh the morality of your actions in this situation? 

If so, you're an asshole of the highest order.

I sincerely doubt that you're at all confused about if you're an asshole or not. I think you're guilty and your conscience is telling you to be punished. The fact, if you made this post, it tells me you're at least not a psychopath, and because you're not, there's no way you don't know you're the asshole. 

I'm not going to take part in wholloping you. You need to deal with your feelings professionally and take better care of yourself. Cut a check to a domestic violence shelter and do some volunteer work there. It's a way better use of your time than looking to an internet forum to lynch you."
9w3o4k,NTA he hurt you and seeing him would make you feel terrible. It makes sense to cut him away from your life
9w3ont,NTA. friend one sounds kinda dumb for dating this guy but ultimately not a bad person. Friend two seems crazy overreactive about stuff. If she would cut ties w you over asking her a question then I would just let it go 
9w3uw2,NTA. Imo you pushed through longer then needed. It's suppose to be a temporary place for the dog half a year is more then enough time for them to find a replacement temp housing or someone to adopt. 
9w3x72,"Not the asshole for getting it towed since it was illegally parked, but definitely the asshole for posting it on Facebook for the entire student body to see instead of just simply reporting straight to higher up. You fuck up when you did that and now they know you're an nosy busybody snitch, and to be honest, you do kinda deserve some blowback for not bothering to realize that it was better to keep it anonymous than telling the whole school. "
9w4srd,"Nope! NTA. Regardless of your reason for reporting, yards are not meant to be driven through. So if you want to report, do it. "
9w4t6v,"NTA.   
$20 is plenty adequate for a student who took three times longer than necessary and cut it too short to boot.  "
9w4xhj,"I think I’m the odd one out saying yes you are. But I also think most people would agree that you need to cut him out entirely. Youre not good for each other, and he at least needs to work on himself a lot, which it sounds like he can’t do while he’s still hung up on you. "
9w4xiq,"You wouldn't be the asshole, but make your expectations reasonable. Not bad to get on record I guess but they cant really act on an almost-crime.

It is something you should share when you give the insurance companies your recorded statement."
9w50g6,[deleted]
9w539i,"You're not the asshole in my book. You can't help what triggers you, and your driver should be aware that his audio book might offend people. I mean, if his role is to shuttle people with mental health issues... Then he should be more considerate of what he has playing in The car. I mean, you have ptsd from abuse... And he's listening to an audio book that contains abuse as a big part of the book... Seems very unprofessional on his end. I think you did the right thing, as he could have triggered someone else. 

So, imo, you're not an asshole, and you should have reported him. At the least, he gets a warning. At the most, he gets fired but maybe learns something important when being a driver."
9w5brq,"NTA. He took advantage of your kindness while also being an asshole for not correctly providing the service that he agreed to get paid for. Cut this person out of your lives. 

"
9w5gna,"NTA for not wanting to pay. They should have said something straight up. Plus you smoked them up. And why wait 2 weeks to ask for the money?? NTA if you don’t want to pay/don’t pay them. I would though just to get that over with, then cut connections with them.

"
9w5gzs,"NTA. She is endangering those animals by working while not sober (you should edit your post to include this) and you don't owe her anything. 

Honestly you wouldn't even be the asshole for snitching for juuling. People don't snitch on each other for victimless stuff because of a sense of camaraderie and stuff. If someone snitches on you first for something victimless (and allowed by the rules) and lies on top of that, it's open season. Just make sure you cover your ass."
9w5hmr,"You're not the asshole for wanting him gone. It sounds like your parents aren't really doing their jobs though? They should be supervising, and there should be some kind of regulatory body overseeing this program to which they can report problems. "
9w5k8p,"This is one of those things where it doesn't really matter what we say. If the guy thinks you are, we're not a court of appeal that overrides him. "
9w5ki2,"Tbh if you can't even share food why are you together? This sounds so weird, for a couple living together to owe eachother money and all that, so weird."
9w64ua,"NTA, don’t get married so soon"
9w6gyj,"That's a pretty shit gift tbh. NTA for feeling ungrateful. There are decent gifts and then there's an 8-year-old laptop that's going to be pretty trash, that's just regifting."
9w6i8t,">She told me that it’s my fault for getting pissed off and doing that because she never asked me to and she called me the asshole for trying to put this on her

I'd say she nailed it.  Yta."
9w6yni,"Everyone an asshole. He almost hit you, your dad was understandably angry. The driver just endangered his child and his dog. But he didn't need to provoke a swearing match. Your dad wasn't wrong in telling him to get his son to behave, but unfortunately, the kid had a disability you didn't notice. The 17-year-old taking photos were most likely in case anything happened. Still not cool. All around a shit situation where everyone's an asshole. Except you, you kinda just almost got hit by a car and then got yelled at."
9w7385,"Nta. She was a pretentious, hypocritical bitch. "
9w7hkz,"You’re the absolute opposite of an asshole. You feel sorry that you’re inadvertently taking advantage of a system rigged in your favor. That’s not AH behavior. NTA friend. Anything but.

10 hours later, and my karma is sixfold. Thanks

23 hours later, and my karma is 11 times higher. Thanks"
9w7olq,"NTA he sounds rather annoying, his habits should change but sounds like they wont"
9w7rbc,"NTA

It’s perfectly reasonable for people to steer clear of drug addicts, ‘reformed’ or otherwise. 

But wondering why Uncle (in title) changed to brother (in TL;DR)?"
9w84ep,"NTA 

You made a good faith attempt to return it and were ignored. Let him do the legwork. "
9w84v9,"They have no idea why they weren't tipped. A ""sorry, I thought I ordered it for 915 when we would be already back"" let's him know he was wrong and there was a communication error somewhere in the chain of you telling the person on the phone telling him it was a time-specific order. My opinion,  NTA, but won't help further mistakes like this."
9w88on,"I would say your NTA, but you should probably explain your reaction to him. Not that you owe him that, he wronged you, but he might honestly have not understood what you meant & why exactly. It would be worth discussing it in my opinion though. "
9w8988,"No.  You could just say that you were not anticipating that, and have already made other plans.  Short notice isn't really your responsibility.  Just say that you wish you could come and are sad that it worked out this way."
9w8jbi,YTA. Stop having sex with her. You're giving her hope for reconciliation. 
9w8kyl,[deleted]
9w8l9c,"NTA for not wanting to, but as someone who's done theatre for a long time, if you want to get more (and larger) parts, you have to deal with not liking the people you're acting with."
9w8y6y,NTA. He is a leech and you dodged a bullet. 
9w8z55,NTA. That’s your place of work and you have a right to tell him to stop visiting multiple times a week.
9w98j0,"Yea, because now, you’ve wasted both his time and you’re own damn time. Def. TA"
9w9a2i,"I might get downvotes, but the way you describe this situation makes you kinda seem like the asshole. In general - yes, if she is constantly not telling you about plans until the last minute that’s kinda shit. But it seems like you just need to chill out and not be so controlling. One hour is still an okay amount of notice, particularly if you’re not actually going out anywhere they’re just calling round to the house. 

Your language and the way you describe your wife, and they way she ‘should have’ responded to you were kinda stuck ups Relax and appreciate that life isn’t always planned. "
9w9bgg,NTA but still technically a criminal. 
9w9gc9,"Maybe you did not handle the situation perfectly, but I truly believe that we need to start holding one another to some standard of decency. People behave so poorly while others stand by and tolerate it. The fact is that people behave so poorly BECAUSE others tolerate it. Enough is enough. When someone fails to exhibit manners or fails to treat another person with respect, we should all be politely (or sometimes directly) letting them know their behavior is unacceptable.

NTA."
9wa0yc,"NTA, but just a few points:

- I assume your parents were the ones that bought the piano? If so, they can do whatever they want with it

- You have no obligation to help them fix this piano

I have no idea what you should do at this point, but a good place to start is probably considering alternative options so you can practice, even if that means using this ""terrible"" piano. After all, practice on a shitty piano is still better than no practice at all, right?"
9wa4hq,The one thing that I don't understand is how come she wants to get a cat or kitten if she's not going to be able to stay there and take care of it. That would be my main objection
9wa761,"I don’t think you’re the asshole. Seems like he was being insensitive. I can get where he’s coming from feeling uncomfortable that you were on his phone without permission but at the same time, it was pretty disrespectful of him to keep and laugh at something that you told him made you feel bad. "
9waeno,NTA
9wafyp,"NTA at all. Some people with authority over kids use that power negatively and this is a great example of that. I mean, really? Telling kids they can’t talk about something that’s perfectly appropriate? That’s so ridiculous. That’s some Grade A bullshit right there. And I’m sure the kids do despise him and have every right to."
9wagq1,"NTA, I've commented a lot on this subreddit and I most commonly advocate for open communication (which is what you did here)"
9wapkw,Absolutely NTA. True friends know that dating and ex is a no-no unless you have given the okay. I've been in a similar situation myself with someone who I thought was really close to me. I gave him an ultimatum and he didn't chose me. I dodged a massive bullet there and haven't looked back since. They didn't work out either and he's tried coming back into my life. Don't bother with fake friends like that. Definitely NTA
9way2r,"NTA, what her and her friends are doing is way across the line for what a family needs to deal with internally."
9wb2qf,I would say you are NTA. Your work space is being disrupted by something that is preventable and non work related. You could try bringing up your concerns to a supervisor and the suggestion that people who want to show off babies do so in that other space. 
9wbqco,"You have the right to say no, you're the one paying after for the cars maintenance, fuel and what not. "
9wd4ww,NTA but I feel like you're trying to validate yourself in this sub. Sorry that he's a dick though.
9wdh49,"Dating is how you figure out whether you're into someone.  It's not a commitment to just go out a few times and spend some time getting to know her.  Being 100% into someone before you dated would be weird and probably a delusion.  Nta, try dating."
9wdyhs,NTA
9wdyqf,"There are definitly some whiny assholes in that story, but you aren't one. At least you didn't get upset about not being let into a party you didn't have the tickets for and then wanted to hit your friend for not being depressed."
9we4rj,I’d get it to him. As much as he’s an asshole that was something from his mom. 
9we6a2,"NTA at all and if you know any of her friends or relatives, I’d call them or message them and tell them what she did.  This will have a two fold effect. Number 1, she will receive attention and help from loved ones. Number 2, she’ll probably stop sending you shit like that. "
9we6yu,"NTA. Though your workplace had been good to you.  You shouldn't have to lose money to convenience them. Explain your situation and any reasonable person would understand, and if they don't, even more reason to not accommodate for them.  "
9wecxu,"You're NTA for asking, but you will be if they say no for literally any reason and you make an issue of it. Welcome to the part of living with a roommate that sucks the high hard one. "
9wef7o,"Your mom seems like a psycho, if there was ever an easier way to get courts to rule against you it’s to act like she did. "
9wf8re,"this is a hard one, but... NTA. You have your own life, very few vacation days available, and you've got a BIG change in your life heading your way. If your family wants to see you, they're welcome to visit YOU.

Also, just 12 vacation days a year? WTF??? Do yourself a favor and find a better job. Twelve days of vacation per year; that oughta be a crime. One month MINIMUM!!!!!"
9wffzo,"This depends entirely where you are throwing them out. What grass are you throwing this on? Its it someones lawn? Its it the towns lawn? If its any space that people use/mow, then yea, YTA. I wouldn't want apple cores in my mower, or enjoy a walk when suddenly I'm stepping on someones trash. If you're tossing it in the woods or something, then no problem."
9wfnty,You’re a huge fucking asshole. That’s one of the most painful conditions known to man. Try googling it.

9wh7x3,"You’re really not the asshole but the situation you’ve described, she’s legally a tenant and has rights there too which include inviting people over.

Yes you’re doing her a solid and it’s impacting on your enjoyment of your own house, so I will never call you the asshole in that situation, but her social life doesn’t end because of that.

You need to negotiate this with your sister, and simply being “my house my rules” won’t cut it.

Set agreed boundaries, eg certain times of day, certain activities that are out of bounds, etc.

Like, from the sounds of it no actual problem exists except for the presumptiveness of it, and maybe drinking.

It would be easy to set some agreed rules: notice before guests come over and don’t get drunk?

Or maybe ask to be invited too? So it’s not *your sister partying at your house*, but you having a party *with* your sister?"
9whhpy,Not the asshole but as a mechanic I can tell you not all are the same. One guy in the shop my inspect your car much better than another. And brake lines are tricky they really ought to be replaced on old vehicles. But sometimes they can look ok and be ready to fail. If they are a decent shop they will cut you a deal to get it fixed and I would be looking at replacing the rubber lines going to the front as well. And have the hardlines inspected for corrosion 
9whk5y,"NTA. At all. As a pianist who has accompanied singers, it's the responsibility of the accompist to know they're music like the back of their hand, or atleast well enough that you could go through a rehearsal without causing any issue. I would NEVER depend on sight-reading for a performance, unless you're literally franz liszt (in which case you can do whatever you want). 

It'd be one thing if he just didn't respond well, but had his music down-packed. But in this case, he didn't respond well AND he didn't know is music well. He had it coming.

9wi1vx,Just don't run for political office and everything will be fine.
9wi322,NTA. Idk why people have it in their heads that ‘open until 5 means I just need one foot in the door by then’ when it actually means you need to get out by then. 
9wi8vm,"You wouldn't be an asshole, but a gift wouldn't hurt"
9wi9zo,"NTA, of course. You don’t need to have boyfriends/girlfriends if you don’t want them. Who you date is your decision, and being choosy with your partners is better than settling for anyone who asks you. Plus, you’re only 19. You have years yet to start thinking about that sort of thing. "
9wigsd,NTA - people should really stick to ‘social rules’ even though it is a virtual thing and not face-to-face. Some people just blurt out stuff without ever thinking...or contemplating who will receive a notification to only see some unimportant comment. I am in a simular situation when it comes to our safe-community-app. It is supposed to be used only for important safety issues concerning our street but people use it to talk about stupid crap. I have that group chat muted which makes the whole goal of the app (getting notified straight away when there is a safety related issue going on) pointless.

9wirca,You are definitely not the asshole for inquiring. That seems weird and fishy and like you wouldn't want to work for them anyway if they're gonna be like that
9wiu1j,"NTA 

But does she understand the exact reasons for you stopping by “just to get money”? Like the reason with the bank and paying things on time so your credit score won’t be hurt? It could just be a misunderstanding "
9wivpw,Asshole? No. Tacky as fuck? Yes.
9wiy1p,"NTA, this sounds like the start of a horror film."
9wj0vy,"NTA. I am not sure if you have to give written notices, sometimes it seems to depend on the place, but even at that point still not the asshole. 

Notices in general are not required, usually they are more of a customary/nice/friendly thing to do for the business and allows you to have a reference if you decide to put them down for future jobs."
9wj1yp,"You’re not the asshole. You are taking care of your girlfriend, which is rightly your first priority, and obviously you’re not actually killing your cats. 

Your “friend” who is making your choice to rehome your cats seem so ugly *is* the asshole. I suspect she has a crush on you, but regardless she is clearly not a kind person. 

"
9wj2m0,"Yes, YTA and sound really manipulative."
9wj5o9,"Yes. Never do that again. Get the fuck out of that relationship too. I’m no fortune teller, but bad shit is headed your way if you stay. "
9wjgp7,"You asked them to do something very simple and gave them more than enough reason for why you were asking. For them to just ignore you is a little disrespectful to say the least, regardless of the outcome.

I don't think you're the asshole in this situation in the slightest."
9wjh7k,"YNTA, but damn your BF is so goddamn dense lol."
9wjifg,"NTA, but your friend is."
9wjki0,"Ok a few things:

Regarding how you feel about your friend's girlfriend, NTA. Until you act on it, NTA.

Now about this line:

> my thoughts as to why she's being this way is because she's not getting this attention from my best friend

People have different levels of comfort when it comes to physicality, the fact that you would think it means that your friend is being a bad boyfriend is just delusional.

If you act on this, you will be a monumental, delusional asshole."

9wjsu6,"Definitely NTA... she needs to grow up and cook for herself. Like you said, you aren't her dad. Also, maybe she should be contributing to the mortgage and other costs of living there...but that's a separate issue. "
9wjtnr,"Nopenopenope. Don’t play with toxic people, and overwatch has way too many, my cousins the same way, she dies once and blames the team then gives up and plays a character shes awful as."
9wjtyp,"NTA. As long as doing this isn't somehow ruining her financially, you're within your right to make your own life choices. That said, offering support through frequent communication and helping her get a hobby of some sort would go a long way."
9wk1hm,YTA. What's the point? You must be fun at parties. 
9wkbc6,I’ve dealt with assholes like you my whole life. If it’s public parking than deal with it. You’re nobody to reserve common parking on the street grow the fuck up
9wkih8, NTA for telling someone off who is being hateful. Good for you for standing up. 
9wkkk0,"NTA. Its birthday, not week. If ur getting screamed at for tolerating all that BS its time for upgrade the squaw."

9wkvxe,"It's always good to be realistic but don't go around crushing people's hopes and dreams. Doesn't matter how unrealistic it may seem to you. Let them figure that out on their own. 

And aren't you too young to be on reddit? Lol"
9wl3jb,"Yes. You gave him a verbal contract when you agreed to pay $2000 for the car, with a promissory note to boot.

If he fudged the price on the title, that may be an issue for him.

If you can prove that the car was misrepresented when you agreed to the sale, you might be able to sue to cancel the promise. But do not just stop paying, since it puts you on the defensive in any lawsuit."
9wl51e,"Maybe talk to her about it before completely writing her off. She could be going through a lot and doesn't want to be a bother to people by complaining. So far, NTA. Friendship is a 2 way street. You aren't obligated to be friends with someone who doesn't wanna hang out with you. "
9wlajj,NTA 
9wlm4e,"Sigh. Same age and same boat. 
For wanting it? Nope, not the asshole. But I also know that you have to be very careful how you approach this with your friends. 

My method has been making new friends. People who do not have children or who have older children. 

Keep in touch with these friends, and when they are ready, try again. "
9wloyt,Yta for assuming that job security is the only valuable aspect of such an education.
9wluls,"NTA, the parading around with a rope around his neck proves he was being an attention whore.  "
9wmast,"Imo Not the asshole, if she can’t be trusted to stay clean then how can she be trusted to be with the kids if that makes sense."
9wmtow,"Nothing wrong with having a preference, it's the same as liking a different body type over another. Racism is when hate comes into the equation, but as you said, no hate involved :) "
9wn1mn,"nta. you did the right thing by telling your teachers and they did nothing.

full marks for creativity "
9wn5an,"No. Fuck “saving seats” this isn’t kindergarten lunch time, you paid for your ticket and waited in line before them, you should get the rewards for that. "
9wn6pp,"Nope. Seems like you reacted as good as anyone could expect. 

Personally, I'd have pulled the same joke AFTER making the pasta, so you come home and see the raw pasta, get pissed, then get relived once I bust out the cooked stuff.

I mean, he knew you were hungry, wtf."
9wnb7w,"NTA for telling her how you feel, YTA for telling her you couldn't get over it. You have to get over it, that's really your problem, not hers. This really feels like you tried to make her feel guilty for not sharing your feelings and that's not ok. "
9wndzk,"From the way you describe it, you guys seem like major fukken assholes.  It doesnt sound like he has an annoying personality or anything.  just rearrange the script.  


""My friends and I are all big into partying, sports and outdoors, except this one weeb who follows us around.  He watches anime, goes to conventions, and doesn't even care about football. He's quiet, doesn't talk to girls, and doesn't get invited to parties. He seems like a great dude and he's super nice and he even brings us food. He's learning about basketball and always wants to join our pickup games even though he's not any good.  We tried ignoring him but he won't leave. How do we let him know he's not cool or popular enough for our group?"" 


I'm not saying that you are obligated to be anyone's friend but it seems you are ostracising someone because they don't fit the mold.  If the only reason you won't hang out with this guy is because he doesnt have enough Otaku points, maybe you guys are the narrow minded ones.  "
9wntwi,No you're not the asshole. Can you speak to her or a director privately about the chatting? 
9wnye2,"NTA, but also that does not sound like a very healthy friendship. "
9woh4x,You were not asked for an explanation because you knowingly acted unprofessional and childish in front of a group of colleagues. Yes YTA. 
9woig5,"NTA as long as you politely asked, this happens quite often and it can't be helped sometimes. The guy probably was just having a bad day/running late himself."
9wojw3,"If you didn’t make things clear that it was platonic and there is no chance of a future... YTA. 

If I was in her position, I’d be so confused. You want to hang out... for dinner... which you’re paying for... on your own birthday? Seems like something you’d want to do with very close friends or someone you’d want to datd"
9wonc9,IMO NTA everyone needs there own time for there own sanity! Yes you can help but don’t feel burdened and weighed down by There problems!
9wopg0,"In my country (italy) there is a commission when you pay with a card, and most stores don't let you pay with the card for less than X euros (as they would essentially lose money for that). Maybe it's the same? I wouldn't be surprises if taxes took away most of the revenue from your little pirchase. Try paying with coins instead? Overall i'd say NTA. It's his duty to deny the card if he has this problem, you are just honestly purchasing meat. "
9wp3r7,NTA.  An 8 year old running around a gym is a liability and he as well as others could get hurt.  They offer a designated area so there is no reason the child is in the gym unsupervised.
9wp8p2,"Yes. If you realize you shouldn't have slapped him, you already know you are the asshole. I don't get it. You're both the asshole here, you're just the bigger one. "
9wpa9m,"YTA - The baby is both of your responsibilities even though she is a stay at home mom. She's not ""Choosing"" to do the house work when she sleeps, she can't do it while the baby is up and needs to be looked after. 

Taking care of a baby and a house is not ""easier"". It's frustrating and lonely, and exasperating."
9wpbsf,"Yeah your the asshole, but in your defense it sounds like you might have been drunk and unintentionally rude. So it sounds like neighbors sister was fishing for compliments, something that really annoys me when people do that, but I don't think her fishing for compliments was insulting to LLF probably more funny to her. Then YOU insulted LLF by saying this lady talking about losing weight is rude to LLF because obviously LLF is the fat one and is the one who needs to loose weight. I'm sure that's not what you said verbage wise, but that's how that comes across. I would apologize and hope it blows over and maybe rethink getting really drunk when your trying to make good impressions. "
9wprhq,"NO assholes here.

We will never truly know his motive. That being said just because YOU feel unattractive doesn't mean you are. My lady i would compliment all the time and she would call herself a potato so i started calling her one hot potato and other stuff.

People see beauty differently and every single person has a different picture of beauty about the same person. "
9wq2oy,Yeah yta. This was a very Childish and immature hung to do which is why the adults around you thought it was awful and the kids thought it was funny. No offense but are you 11 op?? 
9wq3hk,"NTA. Tell him politely you feel uncomfortable by the way she acts in your home, that you're always there for him and his daughter and they're welcome any time, but Jane is not.

Your house, your rules. In fact, I think allowing her in your home may enable her behavior. "
9wq5zu,You just sound really bored.
9wqcva,NTA he didn’t even care enough to wash it
9wqdte,NTA sad that YOU have to tell adults how to behave these days
9wqh38,"You’ll be the asshole if you keep doing it now that you know it makes people uncomfortable. And I can easily see how it would - it’s unnerving to have someone right behind you, not to mention that if they need to brake suddenly, you’ll likely crash into them."
9wqom9,"YTA You saw what the employee did and said nothing.  They don't know you live in an apartment,  they aren't psychic.  If you had asked them to put it in a box they would have.  "
9wqqss,"YTA but with good intentions. It’s not your decision and not your body, and if you are on his back about it, you become irritating and (although I am not implying that smoking is fun) a killjoy.
I know a group that had a friend like this, always disapproving of what they did and being vocal about it. That group split apart from her as she became annoying and too much of a mum friend but it could’ve been avoided if she just kept herself out of it. "
9wqwlk,"$300 is nothing for a chair you're sitting on 40 or more hours a week... heck, I would've spent more."
9wr46l,"You are NTA, it's hard to hear that you're seeing things through a negative filter and that probably hurt her feelings but she needed to hear it.  Maybe she'd benefit from seeing a therapist who can help her explore it in a safe environment."
9wr5a5,"So... a few things:

A) Is it your house or your boyfriends? As in, who ultimately is responsible for the care/condition/well-being of the house? That answer plays a huge role in my feelings on who is or isn't the AH here.

B) This is his son... if he is the way he is and your BF hasn't done anything to try and change him, you're NEVER going to win that battle... so either accept it or move on

C) While I understand your angst at lack of intimacy... is it really fair to compare your situation with his?

Ultimately, you're TA for being mad at him for getting laid... but he and your BF are ALSO TA for the entirety of the situation."
9wr73c,"You can only do one thing. Establish your dominance, wave your tail as a symbol of power, and watch at they cower in fear. They'll never meow in your vicinity ever again"
9wr7wi,"You're not an asshole for not wanting to patch things up. He agreed to your request to not talk to her, and he betrayed that agreement. 

Now. There's a lot to this story. I'll make a judgment on each one: 

You ARE an asshole for asking him to not talk to her in the first place. I understand you had feelings for her. But you weren't dating. You have no right and no position to demand or guilt someone into not pursuing a relationship they want. If Mike had feelings for Monica, and Monica didn't have feelings for you at the time, then you shouldn't have interfered. If you had an issue with it, then you should have just left Mike and Monica alone. It's one of those ""you can't have your cake and eat it too"" situations. 

You are also an asshole for cursing him out and telling him to go to hell. There are WAY better ways to handle that situation. I get you were reacting emotionally, but asshole nonetheless. He betrayed you, you retaliated in anger. It's a bit justified, but at the same time you were essentially guilting him into avoiding Monica which, if he had true feelings for her, you completely disregarded his feelings in support of your own. 

So long story short, you're not really an asshole, except for being selfish about Monica. Even then, I can understand why you did what you did... but it wasn't a good thing. 

Now, if you don't want to patch things up, that's okay. But believe me... this is a controversial topic and letting a close friendship die for that reason is dumb. Sure your friendship was growing apart but every friendship changes over time. This will eat at you forever until something is resolved."

9ws2fa,"It doesn't seem like she made a deal out of it, just made plans to stay with your brother instead. Unless she starts making comments let it go, you got what you wanted and she has a place to stay. "
9ws5uv,"Definitely NTA for not wanting him to come. You WBTA, however, if you were the only one to say no, and expect her not to bring him. Speak to your parents and tell them how you feel, maybe even share what she's told you about his behavior. If they change their minds, you aren't an asshole for having convinced them."
9wsas1,"NTA.  The situation sucks and I'm sorry your brother is terminally ill, but it's not your responsibility to be his healthcare assistant.  Your brother's illness doesn't mean you should uproot your entire life. "
9wsbli,You're the asshole. People are allowed to change their mind without owing you an explanation if they don't want to give you one.
9wsc1f,"As a veteran (30+ years) D&D player... I'm going to withhold judgement, as I've known campaigns to go both ways... and it's always difficult when you have multiple DM-worthy folks in any group and the campaigns/meeting times crossover with each other.

What I would suggest is this - dumb down the description so that the ""average"" user can accurately interpret what is going on here. You are WAY too deep into game mechanics/details that truly bring no useful information to the core question.

Most folks who have little to no knowledge of D&D will read this and go, ""Huh?"" and will be incapable of providing a legitimate ruling on your subjective asshole-ness."
9wt4tt,Talk to your old bandmates about it.
9wt6uj,"I have no advice but definitely NTA. I hear two often how these ""it's just a month"" become a couple months. Hope you and you boyfriend can come to seeing eye to eye! "
9wt806,You're not the asshole and your former friends are scrubs if that's how they treated your financial generosity 
9wtdkc,"YTA.

First of all, learning a second language isn't easy for everyone, especially older people.  Secondly, like your friends said, English isn't our national language.  There is no onus on anyone to speak English just because *you* think it's important to our culture."
9wtim7,"In my opinion you are NTA.  Cockroaches are definitely not something that can just be swept to the side.  They're considered pests for a reason and carry some serious diseases. 

I would usually consider something like this as nosiness but this is a legit health issue that's possibly going to affect a wide range of people.  I think it's right to point out where the source of the infestation could be coming from.  That being said, it's possible that they're in a different apartment completely so there's a chance that everyone's living area could be checked.

Edit: Grammar"
9wto4z,"She enjoys spending time with you or otherwise she wouldn't have done that so much while running. As long as too don't take too much of her time, something like 5 minutes should be okay. She obviously knows how to plan her activities very well, and if she doesn't have time for you, I'm sure she just say it. Also a factor of minor importance, do you like her as a friend or as something more?"
9wtr96,"Your frustration is understandable, but it sounds like your husband needs some real help, and the hero-woship veterans must endure (particularly in the us) could be torturous to one who has seen and done what they may have.
Please get him to a doctor or therapist asap, and good luck!"
9wtsn2,"NTA, bill the company for the original price, pay Greg the price he agreed to and you're done."
9wu12j,"Let me understand, She hands you the card to keep her from using it. A couple hours later she wants to use it. You don't let her use it. Then she blows up and you give her card back. Yeah definitely NTA and definitely keep your finances separate and don't buy her stuff she can't afford because she didn't budget or save for it. Keep your spending on her to gifts on special occasions."
9wu45i,"YTA, sorry the schools attempt to better prepare for a worst case scenario inconvenienced you or made you feel like a child. I’m sure that if god forbid something does happen, lack of training and practice for them and you will keep everyone safe.

By being a brat and not participating, you effectively broke the immersion that the drill should have instilled in all participants.

I hope to god you don’t ever have to live the real scenario down. Although, there’s an increasing possibility you may given the worlds state. "
9wu7ih,"Hell no you're not the asshole, your dad is. What kind of shitty person doesn't talk to their kid for 6 years and then calls up looking for a favor? You're absolutely in the right for saying no, and don't let anyone guilt you otherwise. He screwed up by drinking and driving, not you."
9wu851,"YTA

&#x200B;

Obviously, calling someone dumb in a public video makes you an asshole. Frankly I'm unsure why you need that explained.

> Finally I’d like to add that the teacher is loud, and she even points it out. 

Very obviously not the thing she doesn't like.

&#x200B;"
9wu9r2,"Nope. I think you'd be more of an asshole if you weren't honest, actually. Don't embellish or exaggerate obviously, just tell it like it is."
9wueck,"YTA

It would be one thing if you were just upset about her not saying hi, but the fact you're connecting that to her sex life is extremely strange and creepy. "
9wuffq,"NTA, she wanted to make a remark about how you were playing and you made one back, if she can’t handle the backlash for a comment she made she shouldn’t have made it in the first place

Plus it wasn’t your intention to make her go off like she did it just happened"
9wuhpm,You are supposed to run against traffic.  Otherwise you can't see if a car is going to hit you.
9wurf4,"Definitely NTA. What your father is doing to you is messed up. The fact that you're even wondering if you're the asshole or not - when you absolutely totally are not - is indicative of some serious issues coming up for you. It means that right now your focus needs to be on taking care of yourself and not your dad. 

You should look into Al-Anon or ACA (Adult Children of Alcoholics, not sure your age) or other peer-support groups for family of addicts. Do this sooner rather than later, like ASAP. They'll have the resources and experience you need to get through these feelings."
9wusfp,NTA. She wants to bang on about her personal life she should expect others to have opinions on it.
9wuu93,[deleted]
9wuv9u,"NTA. If it's your private discord server, then your friends should ask first before adding random people. It sounds to me like they're the assholes for ignoring you and not asking you before adding him."
9wv1n8,I'm probably in the minority here but I think YTA. Yeah you and L are getting close but you're not dating and you didn't describe it as such. The good morning texts are a bit weird but you don't have the right to dictate who he can and can't text. It's not like L lied about it or tried to hide it even if his non-decision left a lot to be desired.
9wv2b7,"oooh this all depends on how you word it. Be nice and either ask her to drop a few decibels or explain you go to bed early. then you NTA.

If you go over all demanding and aggressive... definitely YTA"
9wv8xq,"NTA -- Your friends are acting immature.  Which, being 14, is kind of to be expected, but you don't have to like it."
9wv9hi,"Definitely NTA. And I’d have a very, very, VERY serious convo with your wife ASAP about standing up to her mother. This behavior is just beginning. 
The absolute worst character came out in my MIL when planning our wedding, so much so to the point where she offered to give us a certain amount of money to help out with the wedding, demanded we change our venue to accommodate her extended family, and then literally the day before the wedding, fully knowing we had expected a certain $ amount from her, blindsided my husband and myself by saying that she wouldn’t be giving us as much as she offered initially because of the fact that we refused to invite 2 infants under the age of 2. Which caused us to have to come up with over $1000 more than we’d expected.... 
to say it was upsetting is an understatement, but we should have expected it. If she’s continuing this behavior after the wedding, it absolutely warrants a conversation as soon as fucking possible so you and your wife have HARD boundaries that are not to be crossed where MIL is concerned. "
9wve19,"NTA. You made your wishes clear and your friend knowingly agreed, then proceeded to violate your trust."
9wvfhy,NTA. It's your choice to do it. You don't have to be one. She's the asshole. 
9wvq5u,"YTA because you're basically wishing harm on people for your amusement.

You want to see those things, become a storm chaser or something. "
9wvqju,"NTA. You’re protecting your children from someone who isn’t a good role model for your children and might bring harm to them from not taking medication. You’ve given her an ultimatum, and she’s chosen her path. It’s in her hands to change, not yours to cave in. "
9wvsel,NTA. You just used some strong language and a raised voice AFTER trying to protect your wife from HIS dogs. His negligence could have had far worse consequences. 
9wvx2x,"NTA. If you had shared the bed with her, you'd be TA. You slept on the floor and let her avoid driving home drunk. You're a decent guy, OP, and it sounds like your girlfriend doesn't appreciate you being conscientious of other women, no matter how harmless. "
9ww26q,"NTA, you can't be her perpetual sounding board.  She's calling you to vent, not to talk, why do you need that?  You're not her therapist, you aren't responsible for her mental health.  "
9wwg34,"Angry is a strange choice of words, because it implies this person is doing something on purpose. There's no evil intent with coughing.

Yes, it's annoying. You can choose workarounds, like music or white noise or earplugs, but there is no way for this person to stop coughing. You can talk to your landlord about moving to a different unit, or soundproofing. You can move out. But yes, it's weird and inappropriate to complain about coughing."
9wwgji,"Not at all. She can’t even put herself into her daughters shoes to see how it might effect her in the long run. Hell my daughter points out a stupid ass sticker stuck to the ground in the store and I act just as excited as her. Our kids are so pure and innocent when they’re young, we need to try not to break their hearts. 

It’s kind of inconsiderate also that your wife won’t even listen and learn about the topic. Tell her to download Pokémon go and get some basic knowledge from there lmao "
9wwrxr,"NTA, you don't need that drama. You were polite, she wasn't, so that's that."
9wws2y,"Neither one my friend.  Sounds like she has a lot going on in her world and I'm sure you do as well.

Give her the time she needs to mellow out and talk.  It's excellent that you held your tongue when you were obviously frustrated.  I'm 29 and I still can't keep my mouth shut when I should.

I love my mother dearly but I know what it's like to just not want to talk to her.

You're not an asshole and neither is she.  

There's a lot of parent hating on Reddit.  It sounds to me like a little soda favor or a reassurance that you know how much she's struggling would do some good."
9wxkqq,"Making other drivers panic = you're an asshole.  

Get off the road until you're an adult."
9wxl6i,"No and it's disturbing that he's lying to you and ignoring your wishes. These do not a healthy relationship make, even without the drugs. But considering the drugs, he's likely to end up in jail and won't be there for your kid anyways."
9wy8ap,"NTA but when someone refuses an offer accept it the first time. Insisting wasn't necessary and many people will get frustrated with you when you don't hear them saying no. Even if she wasn't disabled, listen and respect when people say no to you. 

If you kept insisting then you would be the asshole. "
9wybck,"Oh jeez, definitely NTA. "
9wydb8,"As long as you’re not leading any of those girls on to believe that you want a relationship with them, I’d say NTA. Nothing wrong with being single and flirting around. Not sure about your friend, maybe she’s into you "
9wz2x5,"Well what makes her the non consenting one as opposed to him? If they were both under the influence then they should both be to blame. Just because he is bigger and stronger doesn’t mean he was any more consenting than her. So no, you aren’t the asshole here"
9wz6jv,NTA. It looks like you dodged a bullet there 
9wziv6,"YTA. Her job requires that she check ID. She's a bitch about it, but it's her job. The paper ID can definitely be declined since there is no photo. It should accompany your expired photo ID. "
9wzlmd,Nta as long as your gf can do the same 
9wzmtq,"YTA. She is obviously an ass hole too, but you actually intentionally hit her vehicle. How old are you? It's McDonald's drive through. Sure we all get pissed at jerks and the injustice when first come first serve isn't honored, but what the actual fuck.... Did you gain anything? Did you get your food any faster? Do you think she learned a lesson? "
9wzv0h,Nta for the 15min yta for cheating  you made your bed now you get to lay in it
9wzwcr,"Why would you be an asshole for this? He's upset because you're depressed. The best thing you can do for yourself right now is realize that a two year relationship when you're in high school or college is pretty much just that. It's only as big as you make it. You broke up, so obviously you weren't right for each other. Now, imagine what's out there. Imagine your options if you work hard to present the best version of yourself.

NTA, just depressed."
9x0225,He is the asshole for sure but maybe just stay in your room out of sight and not in the common area? My sister vapes and I HATE when she does it in her room because it is attached to my room so my room gets smoky  and my walls have gotten sticky from it and I hate the smell and breathing it in. I grew up with parents that openly smoked weed and cigarettes and I just really hate the smell so I spend a lot of time in my room away from them. My roommate in college used to hot box our dorm room as well so I just have a problem with people that are inconsiderate of others. He shouldn't be so rude about it since it's for a medical reason (also I'm glad you've found relief!) but maybe you can compromise and only do it in your room. 
9x0jqz,"I should also add they never thank us for cooking, cleaning, or watching their kids. And they don't give us a gift that hasn't come from a Chinese dollar store (litteraly worse then garbage)"
9x0lpt,"Yes, YATA.
That’s rude. Keep your negative judgements to yourself."
9x0szw,"Definitely NTA if what you're saying is 100% how it happened. If she said from then on out, ask consent, that's fine. But she basically was a complete hypocrite and called you a molester for the last 8 months and said it's fine for her to not ask your consent. 

Though I don't think requiring consent every time is too crazy. Its just pretty weird for a long term relationship. People should learn how to tell someone they aren't in the mood if that person initiates. "
9x0yob,"YTA

A dude took a one week vacation 7 months ago and you're still upset, despite the fact that the issues have been fixed. You should chill.   
"
9x10ik,Did she catch it from you? I’m not a doctor but I think your antibodies are still active from your past cold plus I assume you’re on antibiotics for your nose thing. YTA dude she wants you with her 
9x175w,"NTA, she rejects mental healthcare and these trust issues aren't going to work going forward.  If she wanted the best for the two of you, she would be putting effort into her mental healthcare. Sometimes, it's better to start anew than try to fix things with someone who refuses help.  "
9x1hvi,"YTA, your son wants to go on this trip and his mother has paid for him to go. The least you can do is get the kid to some meetings so he can do something he wants to. 

You don’t want to be the only reason your son doesn’t get to go on a trip. "
9x1pnb,NTA you did the right thing regardless.
9x22w7,"NTA! This is a safety matter that could involve everyone in the building, including your elderly neighbor. He could have difficulty taking care of himself, and maybe he needs a caretaker to assist him. Moving into a nursing home might be the best course of action, for his own safety and everyone else’s. This could set that ball rolling, if necessary."
9x2d0q,"Depends on how the house is situated. Are there things in the garage worth stealing, and does closing the garage protect them? Does your putting an item there so that the garage door doesn't close have a chance of damaging the garage door? Or, do you mean ""garage door"" as in the door leading to the garage? Does leaving this door open leak air and possibly increase costs from the AC having to keep up? 

Either way, if the answer to any of these questions is yes, YTA. Grab a drink before people go to bed, or get a mini fridge that you can access from inside. There are simple things you can do to avoid the garage and keep quiet at night.

No matter what, you're defeating the entire point of the alarm by propping it open, too. YTA. "
9x2tdc,"Just as a general rule, no one is ever an asshole for turning down sex they don’t want to have. "
9x33ll,"Mmmmmmmmm. I wouldn't call you an asshole, but for a partners birthday, personally, I'd do it and just be tired the next day. In six months you won't regret feeling tired that day, but she'll remember you put the effort in."
9x35py,You told her you'll give it to her at the same price you paid for it. That's already a friendly gesture. Her wanting you to reduce the cost and make you lose money makes her the asshole in this case. 
9x37lg,"Well if she's going with just the dude, considering they've swapped nudes and probably talked sexually (whatever ""talked"" means to you), I'd say NTA.

9x3fg0,"YTA. It doesn't matter that you didn't know who he was. If people are sad over a person's death you need to respect that. I don't tend to get caught up in celebrity deaths either, but there are real emotions attached to creators and what they make. And I'm not going to mess with that."
9x3g6g,"Nope. Not a fucking chance. You're good man, don't worry about it."

But not vaccinating their kid? And he almost died to the flu? That sounds like a big red flag.

Go to r/legaladvice to get help with what to do, because you could save the kid's life.

Ps: Make sure you include your location, down to your state (if in the USA) is the most you need."

9x5lbd,NTA. P was hurtin for a beatin and he got it.
9x5pc7,"YTA  I understand that you feel it is over board but this is their love language.  This is how they show their appreciation for you.  I get it that you feel like the shower is for her but she is wanting to celebrate you and your next child.  If you have too many toys or items recycle them and give them to those with less fortune than you.  

I may be biased in my opinion because my husband and I are both remarried, his family shuns us.  I would be grateful to have dinner with them or be acknowledged, let alone celebrated.  

These days as I get older I realize more, that everyone seems to want things on their terms.  You can love me but only if you do it the way I want.  Life doesn't always work out that way.  Your relatives seem like good people, well intentioned.  They respect you and love you, please overlook the overabundance.  It is a small price to pay to be so cherished."
9x5xkv,NTA given the fact that your brother is an asshole and the fact that he did that to your mom made me laugh so fucking hard

9x6gqs,"NTA

Unless you're a toddler with no concept of object permanence, you don't have to see your friends every day.

Also, there's nothing wrong with alone time! After all, it is YOUR time, and you can choose to do what you want with it.

Your friend needs to back off, and realize that being passive aggressive and manipulative aren't the traits of a good friend."
9x6ma5,No. You are not obligated to change your seat.
9x6mha,"Nah, I don’t think you’re an asshole for having thoughts. You would be an asshole (and a creep) if you were telling her all about them and how you want to pursue these fantasies...

But just having thoughts about someone doesn’t make you an asshole. You would only be one if you acted on them."
9x6mlq,"Yes, you are a ignorant asshole. He paid to quickly remove the tree that fell on your property (as you said, it’s your responsibility).  Then when the same thing happens with your tree, you have excuse after excuse and he was very polite. You said yourself that you’re lazy, so he took care of it himself. You seem to think that your token offer to pay for it makes up for you being an asshole, it does not. He did all the work getting quote after quote and finally fixed the problem that you should of reciprocated. I’ll bet the next time his tree falls in your yard you’re shit out of luck and will need to deal with it. "
9x6s8h,"NTA, but it does sound like you're responsible for her dependence on you. If you're not happy you need to figure that out, but you need to be open about your feelings with her and give her a chance to change. Good luck"

9x6waq,YTA. Those conditions aren't bad at all. This is simply called WINTER for many people. Grow a pair and go to work. Take the bus or an uber if your car sucks.
9x6yrg,NTA for not enjoying the friendship.  You don't dislike his company because he's disabled.  You dislike his company because you have nothing in common and feel forced into the friendship by your parents.  
9x6zz1,NTA. He did terrible things. It’s a bit disturbing that your friends aren’t alarmed by his behavior. 
9x7a0e,"Dude, no. 
Tell her that she makes you uncomfortable. Don't lie. 
You are hurting her in the long run by lying. Tell her the truth about how her actions make you feel uncomfortable, so she can learn from this experience and not repeat it in the future. 

By lying to her, you deprive her of the chance to learn and grow. "
9x7avb,"Okay, there's a few different things going on here and it's important to deal with each of them.


1) You gave up your seat for someone you felt could use it more. Good on you! That is polite and conscientious. Your boyfriend is an asshole to complain about you *doing something good* for someone else. But I'm not sure that's really what got his goat here.


2) You didn't just stand up where you were, but moved away from where you'd been sitting and where your boyfriend was still sitting. Not an asshole move by any means, but a little inconsiderate to him. You say you moved to a part of the car with more room. That definitely happens, but...when you're riding somewhere with another person, it's kind of dickish to move away from them. Stand up where you are, next to them. If there really wasn't room for that, maybe *consider* just keeping your seat next time? A woman in her 50s probably isn't in dire straits for a seat. Your boyfriend may have felt hurt you moved away from him.


3) You claim you would have been fine with him staying put... but you describe motioning to him to join you in your new spot. That's not fine. Where's the fine in you *telling him* (nonverbally) to move to where you're at? It's an asshole move to pretend you would have felt X way about something when your actions in the moment clearly demonstrated the opposite. If you were telling your boyfriend that bull before he said his piece, you may have escalated the conflict here.

Without further information, I'm inclined to call both you and your boyfriend slight assholes for being dishonest and weird about your feelings and communication in general."
9x7fzh,"YTA. You weren't the asshole the first time, but she's clearly not into it and you have to respect that."
9x7hau,"NTA.  If it were ideal weather, maybe it would be less of an issue, but they're repeatedly being a nuisance.  It's better to be a snitch than have someone require stitches because of an icy accident."
9x7qzn,"NTA - I get it, you’re worried. But instead of berating your parents (which doesn’t seem to work) I think you should have a heart to heart with your sister. 

Honestly, she sounds like a normal 13 yr old girl. I remember doing all of that. And my parents were very trusting. But because I had an amazing support system, and I KNEW I could turn to people if I ever felt uncomfortable anywhere, I always chose being safe over putting myself in dangerous situations. Let her know you’re there for her - believe me, she’ll think of you when she’s unsure of her surroundings. You don’t have to act like her parent, you just have to let her know you’ve got her back. "
9x7xsm,[deleted]
9x81lu,"YTA

From how I read it, it sounds like they were doing what they thought was the best thing to do. They had a child attempt *suicide* and the options they saw were either stop you from texting the person that led to the suicide or bring you home to keep a closer eye on you. They did what was reasonable as parents because they love you and don’t want their child to attempt suicide again. Sure, going through your texts and threatening to take away your stuff or education wasn’t the most ethical thing, but they did it to protect you. You could always enroll in another semester, granted it would be. with your own money (or loans), but it still wouldn’t be the end of the world.

You have a right to be mad at how they handled it, but at the core of the issue, they did what was best. They did what parents do: protect their children. "
9x83rw,"NTA for wanting some down time to yourself, but your mom is just trying to spend some time with you.  You probably could have been 
more kind in the way you asked her to leave.  In the future, you could let her know that you'd like some alone time to unwind but you'll have a cup of tea or something with her later so you can spend some time before bed.  "
9x85j9,"YTA.

They're not your kids. You don't get to raise them. If you're worried about them getting bullied, you should've spoken to your brother. 

'Destroy his life'??? The bully, I'm assuming, is close to your nephews age? You're talking about a kid here. If you're so worried, go talk to the bullies' parents. It's usually the parents fault anyway.

 Don't be responsible for a kid getting pepper sprayed dude. "
9x8bd8,NTA he didn't have to come up to you just to be grumpy lol
9x8dfv,YTA. You yelled in a guy’s face for breathing heavy *at the gym* where literally everyone is breathing heavy. 
9x8eic,"NTA for not being attracted to her, but YTA if you tell her it's because of her eye because she can't control that, but you should tell her that you're going to have to cancel so you wish her luck.  Don't blame it on her looks."
9x8evd,"You're dating a loser. You're not the asshole, but you are an idiot for trying to mend things."
9x8l28,"NTA. When you steal somebody's smoke, everything escalates to prison rules."
9x8l8g,"Well, yes and no. I can see both sides of this because everyone needs a ""me"" time and this is clearly something you and your friend have been doing for ages now, way before you met her so in your mind its not like she has any right to be hurt over it, after all it preceeeds her.

&#x200B;

In her mind however, she feels like you don't want her company and she probably feels jealous that your friend gets something from you that she doesn't, which feels absurb for her because she's your girlfriend so she should get everything of what your friends can get! Honestly OP you wouldn't be able to talk her out of it so just take her with you one time then act normally. She'll probably see what it really is and will get bored because your attention will be mostly on your friend.

&#x200B;

If not, well it's a relationship, and part of making it last long term is accomodating your SO into your own life.

&#x200B;"
9x8n29,"NTA unless you RSVP'd ""yes"" and are bailing last minute.  A button down, pants nicer than khakis if you have them, and a blazer are perfect semi-formal attire.  Reach out to her and let her know that you don't have anything to wear but want to respect the dress code.  I'd bet she'd rather have you a little underdressed than MIA."
9x8xn8,NTA for protecting your children. 
9x8xoh,sometimes its okay to be selfish when its for your own good. I dont know if shes actually on drugs or not which could make a huge difference but distancing yourself from her because you don't want to see her in that state isn't wrong. YNTA for taking care of yourself and trying to build towards a future you are proud of. before you are her son you're a human being and you need to take care of yourself. 
9x905y,"Oh honey you're not the a-hole here by far. This is a hard decision you'll have to make but you gotta be strong about it. You had a fear response and it's nothing to be ashamed about, and you trusted this guy and he was an absolute creep and dirtbag who misused your trust. I feel like their marriage is already in shambles if they're both willing to cheat, and honestly that's just as damaging if not more than a divorce would be on the family. I've been in your situation before more or less. I found it much easier to just cut ties than to deal with the creep who broke my trust, and people ended up coming to their own conclusions because I didn't register the full extent of the situation until it had become public knowledge.. But you need to do what you think is the right thing for this situation. If you do tell your friend, do it in private and tell them the whole story with no interruptions, explain why it took a while for you to come out about it. Just be prepared for there to be backlash from the friend group. Also you should tell your BF what happened. Either way stay far way from that creep."
9x90c0,"I don't think you are being an ass if he is not contributing to the shared expenses due to his gaming habit.

But it really does sound like you two should set clear guidelines or budgeting for the mutual expenses. As long as those things are funded he should be able to spend every cent on whatever he wants. 

I won't get into the relationship strain of not being a subject of those purchases , that's for another subreddit. 

He is kind of right though, a lot of good games were dropped this quarter of the year..."
9x9eht,"YTA. To be clear, River is also an asshole, but you should hold yourself to a higher standard. You don't get to ""punish"" people when they don't behave as you like... and do you really think using this person's non-preferred pronouns is going to get them to respect you? It would be better for you (better for your character, and better for River to be polite to you) to be polite to them. What sort of person would you rather be, petty or overcoming? You might consider getting a new DM though, River sounds like a drag.

P.S. this isn't about the pronouns, it's about being polite more broadly even in the face of rudeness... so I would say this if you said you were deliberately antagonizing River in any other way."
9x9eli,NTA but you can give her a chance to explain. You friend sounds hurt and lonely. :(
9x9jsz,NTA. Every one can be racist no matter their race. It’s racist to say only white people can be racist.
9x9k7a,"NTA, you can't control your allergies and moving to grandparents isn't huge deal and completely logical"
9xa6nv,"Not the asshole, as a teacher kids always want to push the test back and have more time to “study” "
9xab4x,"You're certainly an asshole for that formatting.

Jokes aside, I think both parties are assholes. I get it, you want to be queen bee- but next time try explaining how things work. *Calmly*. You also might want to keep in mind that you don't own the damn washers.

As for the other lady, she needs to chill. Badly."
9xak66,"Some people are asshats. That’s life and that’s business. Your behaviour seems totally reasonable so don’t worry. 

If they want you they’ll ring. "
9xalns,"Eh NTA.

This sounds like it was really shitty for them but you needed to know for your job and it was hard to hear there.

So definitely sucks, but good on you for trying to be discreet."

9xawux,[deleted]
9xaxrw,"YTA. They could try to evict you, but it would take time. By then the dog would be safe. I wouldn't be able to live with myself.  I'd think about the dog safe and warm and relieved, then tossed right back out like he did something wrong. 
At the very very least, you could have left him outside one of the rescues that was full. He'd be safe."
9xazdo,"NTA, but neither are they. You made a genuine mistake, but for all those guys know you were trying to cut in front and then attempted at bullshitting your way out of it."
9xb5ng,"Wow.

She went to the gym and was trying very hard and was excited and was doing exactly what you wanted - then she went to you for encouragement and support and approval and you were like “you’re still fat, babe”

You’re an asshole.

You can be honest while still being kind and tactful. You can also be honest and be an asshole, and that’s what you are.

The fact that she’s hurt should be enough reason for you to apologize. You devestated her and you don’t even care. You just care about being right."
9xbfcf,YTA. They're also assholes. No one here looks good.
9xbji6,Nta for asking her to pick a different subject with you. You would be if you gave her shit over talking with the friend at the dog park. 
9xbp4a,"NTA for wanting it but maybe the asshole if you push your own agenda and prioritize it over his.   

Marriage is a team situation that requires lots of discussion, compromise, and giving what your partner wants equal consideration as that of your own wants.  

Discuss. Agree on something. Then abide by that."
9xbt3g,"NTA because he didn't get your permission, YTA because you called him a cunt over it while his intentions were good, although the actions were not."
9xburf,"NTA. She asked a question and you gave an honest answer. You tried to explain your position, and she still was focused on herself. You can do your best to communicate, but that doesn't always mean some people will hear you.

Additionally, if she is calling you for several hours a day, she's transferring a lot of stress to you, and likely wearing you down. It's hard to carry a burden for someone else. You're only human."
9xbwhr,"Do you guys HAVE to have matching rings? When my friend's ex proposed to him, he requested a totally different ring than his man proposed to him with. His ex wasn't happy at first, but accepted it. "
9xc2my,"YTA. It's 33 degrees outside, your child should be wearing a coat."
9xc4os,No its a horrible problem with people nowdays. There is one thing being 10 or maybe even 30 min late to stuff but by hours is a real dick move. I can't tell you how many dinner parties I've had ruined by the guest being super late and the food just sitting waiting. I've learned if I'm making food for people to make like a stew or something can it sit on low waiting for people to show up. 
9xcin3,"NTA. Kind of obvious. At least you talked to him like a real person, and didn't just ignore him while using your phone"
9xcu6q,"I don't think you are the asshole, it's just a misunderstanding. But next time put it in the fridge maybe? And definitely get some cockroach traps and poison. "
9xcutm,"NTA, but her going hunting with her father is a good thing. It's a bonding time thing that's important to her and her father.

Just see her another time."
9xcws9,"NTA, but sort of a dick.  You never discussed exclusivity and it doesn't sound like she was actually your girlfriend.  You did put her sexual health at risk by not letting her know you were non-monogamous, but you didn't actually cheat because there were no agreed upon boundaries to violate."
9xcxs5,"Nta, it wasn’t her position to go searching. But is it possible your brother was actually ok with it or gave her what she thought was permission?"
9xd67u,"Yes, you're an asshole. He lives a BLOCK away from you. What are you so worried about? Why would it be awkward talking to your friend and girlfriend? Isn't that fairly normal stuff to do? You know, introducing your friends to your girlfriend and vice versa. 

If you're not willing to drive a block over but you'll go out of your way to pick her up just because you think it'll be awkward, then yeah, you're kind of an asshole.

Not a glaring, major asshole, but that's a bit of an asshole thing to do."
9xd6h2,Not the asshole. Keep him far far far far away. 
9xd8as,You nailed unique. 
9xd9l0,"NTA!
She’s rude, overbearing, and she’s lying and too much!

9xehm6,"NTA, he shoved something in your mouth and you tried to spit it out.  You had a normal reflex.  Carl got what he deserved."
9xeoez,"Nope, I'd be pissed too."
9xer2e,NTA you left specific instructions to give you a call. He didn’t and it could have all been avoided had he just called you. 
9xev8q,"YTA. You expect this man to marry you and trust you, but you won't tell him this story while you'll tell the internet without issue - just to make sure you're not in the wrong. You're in the wrong. 

Man up and explain to him that they're shit people and you're both better off without them in your life.

You're not ""protecting him"", you're protecting yourself. You're hurting him by keeping secrets, especially since they're so important to the way you live. Explain why you don't want to see them."
9xf3bg,[deleted]
9xfivd,"I'm divided on this one. On one hand, he clearly wanted to receive anonymous advice which you will now monitor. That reeks of spying. On the other, he's posting publicly; you've just become aware that a particular account is associated with him.

Overall, I'm going to lean towards YTA. I could see it either way though."
9xfu94,">Now me being the good friend likes to make jokes to them at times. Things like ""persons name, get your dick out of her etc"".

Aren't jokes supposed to be funny? O.o 

And you're saying this stupid shit in a college class, where the lecturer - the professor? - can *hear* you? Yeah YTA. "
9xfw0u,"I feel like YTA. This seems like the equivalent of asking to be venmo'd money back for buying a girl a drink and she happens to not be into you. I don't know what her reasons are (I mean, maybe you could elaborate and change my mind), but I'll be honest, I myself have been really seemingly into a girl, then kinda woke up and admitted to myself that it wasn't for me, and I've had the same stuff happen to me. So even if they are invalid to you, they still may be valid to her."
9xg0bm,"YTA

You live in a gated community and you're upset that people aren't letting rando's into the gate. That's literally the point."
9xg1q3,"YTA, but you're not the worst person who ever lived.

She was moving far away and you both agreed that it was a short term thing.  That's fine.  But then you spend months (?) talking non-stop, sending dirty pictures, etc.  That behavior isn't really casual.

You can't have one ""It's not serious"" conversation and expect that to be bulletproof, your actions have to match your words.  Yours didn't.

Meanwhile, does Nicole know about Laura?  Because it seems like she could easily find out and that could cause real problems for you."
9xg445,"Yta, there’s no need to tell people directly, just be “busy” a few times that they make plans.  Telling them that you don’t want to be friends and that you want more from their friendship makes you seem very selfish and “to good “ for them. "

It's legally yours or their breaking the lease. Ask for a break on rent or refuse. "
9xgcdm,"NTA, it's good for him to know for future cases, shes the asshole imo"

9xgo3u,"NTA, they probably got it out of the lake so someone could use it again. If they really want one they’ll buy one. Or they would’ve thrown it right in their vehicle. "
9xgpkf,"YTA for agreeing and not doing it.

NTA if you say no to things."
9xgppt,"Definitely not the asshole and you shouldn’t be guilted into being someone’s friend or talking to them.

She sounds like she has a lot of insecurities. That’s a her problem, not a you problem. Anyone would get burned out with that level of communication. I talk to a couple people regularly throughout the day but none of us freak when one of us goes MIA. People do things sometimes. "
9xgqh9,"NTA for not wanting to be around him and besides, do you want your current boyfriend to be attack by him on Thanksgiving weekend?  "
9xgwet,"NTA, no. You've done more than enough and it's their responsibility."
9xgwjx,"Not the asshole, but you probably should give a second thought to a comment like ""He is no way appeared outwardly homosexual, and was quite muscular."" "
9xgxc4,"NTA- (or possibly YTA to everyone involved) 
Nobody likes group projects but let this be a life lesson on how to communicate and delegate which will equip you for any managerial/corporate position in the workplace. This situation is a direct result of poor communication skills of the entire group. Outlines should have been agreed from the outset with deadlines & agreed method of contact. This would have avoided the situation. 

They took it upon themselves to do all the work (the shouldn’t have) but you had the responsibility to realize your workload didn’t match the project and you didn’t communicate with your group. 
As for the email... Any time an email with vital information is sent for ANY project, be it for work or school, it should be sent with a confirmation receipt. It’s basic stuff really. Always check in and ask how everyone is else is going every once in a while to avoid these situations that could end up with your grades being penalized. 

Edit- on mobile (formatting)"

9xh9oo,Nah. Id be uncomfortable too.
9xhfjb,"Nta for refusing, but kinda an asshole for missing the point.  It’s not about helping him financially, or creating an obligation for return favors.  It’s just an easy and professional way to get together and say congrats.  

Depending on how much everyone was throwing in,  and how many of you’re peers are contributing, you could definitely be perceived as an asshole, especially if you’re the only one not pitching in. "
9xi24g,"NTA, you’re warning them out of good interest (you don’t want them to lose a job opportunity bc of a post)

**You are absolutely an asshole... but in this case, you shouldn’t give a damn.**

Never cool to read someone’s private shit. Asshole. This is a horrible invasion of privacy and breach of trust, and finding something “bad” on your SO never justifies your action. 

That said, thank goodness you did this, you asshole. You married a guy who is deeply emotionally invested in someone else, and apparently has been for your entire relationship. This, simply put, is “need to know” information - you’re committing your *life* to someone who would rather be with someone else (at the very least, isn’t happy enough with you to stop pining over someone else).

He’s an asshole for letting you think he’s as in love with you as you are with him. Totally fucking wrong to marry someone while you still harbor *intense* romantic feelings/longing for someone else. 


Being an asshole, in this instance, saved years or decades of life that you otherwise would have wasted on him (assuming you do the right thing and leave him). The only truly wrong move now is to stay with him despite knowing what his feelings are - and have been for your *entire* relationship.

9xj17o,You're all assholes. Have fun in law school. :)
9xj4az,"You're *both* dumb teens, you are *not* an asshole, he is a tremendous gaping asshole.

 I'm not going to shame you, but I don't view it as very wise to take care of someone's life at such a young age when you're still struggling with AP classes, nor is it smart to just ignore the feelings you are fairly certain someone has for you. That kind of stuff needs to be addressed. I'm not perfect, I've scrapped my knees and burnt fingers, mark this mistake as a lesson learned.

 Also, other kid sounds like a shithead with problems. Don't give him a pass on what he did. I'd feel like reporting it to a staff member of the school, though I'm experienced in the ""it's been too long, let us know if it happens again so we can give him a warning"" maneuver."

Why bother asking what he wanted if you're just going to pooh pooh his list and get him what you want anyway? "
9xlf39,"This is hard to read and follow because of the initials you are using, it would be easier if you just made up names.  But it looks like you took someone who said she might commit suicide seriously while this other girl didn't?  If so then no, you are not the asshole."

9xn5oi,"You're too nice, I would had left them both there if they pulled that kind of bullshit, if your BF and his friend want to have a date night let them.

NTA at all."
9xnfa3,"Yes, you're the asshole but only because you agreed to and failed to honor the expressed terms of the gift.  It's a weird thing for him to ask, and if he just sprung this on you weeks later, I'd say he was crazy for even thinking of it, but he was up front about it, and you should have said you had no use for a couch you couldn't smoke on.    Sorry, this is your fault."
9xnmfm,NTA. If you guys planned something out like that and he went and worked out instead he's a prick. Tell him so. 
9xnzal,NTA - you just suffered a loss. If people cannot understand why you have little patience during this time - they’re the assholes.
9xo93w,NTA. Stay away from her because shes a huge cunt for that. Dont let her back into your life anymore than she already is and cut her off. 
9xoev1,NTA. He doesn't sound like a friend. 
9xoie8,That girl is such an asshole you are by no means an asshole. Ignore the shit out of her.
9xolpn,"NTA. Ed sounds really insensitive. He's only in it for his own happiness and he doesn't care about anyone else's. Sounds like you did your part. If he contacts you, be straight up with him. But if you're okay with drifting away at this point I don't see why you shouldn't let it happen."
9xom6n,"Not the asshole. He is. If you can find that post, put a review on it. Let everyone know how he dicked you around and used you for publicity. I’m actually pretty ticked on your behalf right now. The dude was king of assholes. "
9xop5r,You’re not the asshole. The transportation issue alone would keep me home
9xoya4,"I think you need to work to find something you can do that lets you feel accomplished. NTA for your feelings, but if Pokémon Go is this important in your life, you need to get into some other things."
9xp2kx,"Not the asshole. I think some people will believe you are an asshole for butting into someone else's business, but I think major life-threatening decisions makes a pretty damn good reason to butt into someone's life. 

I don't know how bad sniffing lighter fluid is, but it sounds extremely dangerous. Do a bit more research on it, confirm the dangers, and confront him first. Then, if he refuses to budge, maybe consider confronting the mother. "
9xqf4g,"If he'll pay for the shipping, just do it. It's not your stuff. He's being immature but that's... not surprising considering how he left? If you give him his stuff back you might never need to deal with that foolishness again. If he makes you pay for it, YNTA"
9xqfj1,"No, you're NTA at all. This is a touchy subject that they're trying to creep around to get the answer. They want the answer they're actually looking for, they have to ask the question. They don't want to say what's your ethnicity, but they want to know what it is."
9xqfyh,"Yeah kind of.  If she is part of the group then she is part of the group. 

On a different note. I went to a similar type of HS. "
9xqggc,"I'm wavering on this one. But I'm leaning towards not the asshole.

Your brother is an adult, obviously. With a fiancee. The fact that she was even okay going on your parents plan is pathetic to me. If it was just him, you, and your parents that is one thing because you're all family and it might make sense so the bill is cheaper. 

But adding her into that? That's just stupid. I get that she ""will be"" family. But they're adults and should be paying their own way. Not draining data on your family plan like inconsiderate assholes. It's clear she is the one using lots of data if it only happened once she was added.

You're not wrong in saying they should have their own plan. But you are slightly, just a tiny bit of an asshole for suggesting that when you don't pay for the plan either.

You didn't say how old you are so I can't really get a better grasp on it. If you're over 18 then I'll stick to what I said but if you are a minor then I wouldn't give you shit (or as much) for not paying some of the bill. 

You were **real** with him and he didn't like it.

""You're an adult and have a fiancee maybe it's time you get your own phone plan.""

That's literally something your parents should be telling him."
9xqhit,You gave them a bad review for bad advertising and bad service..... how would anybody think you’re an asshole for that?
9xqkoy,You are not the asshole. Your parents sound like wonderful hard working-people. If it were my parents I would ask them to consider if taking in these kids would make them to tired to enjoy any potential future grandchildren. Also they are starting there later years and headed towards golden years. They deserve a chance to enjoy themselves and the family they raised for once. It’s tough though I have taken in family and families children sometimes you just can’t help but love. There came a time when I had to love myself first. It was a hard transition but well worth in the end. My heart goes out to your parents.
9xqp3b,"NTA.  I cut off my grandmother before she died.  She was always very mean to me, when I was young.  

Her whole family, including my father, are judgmental and gossipy.  I don't do the gossipy southern BS.  

My father is constantly verbally abusing my almost 80 year old mother. 

My older brothers are all adults but they still mooch off my parents.  It is ridiculous!  

I cut them all out of my life, except for my mom.  Life is too short to deal with assholes-even when they are related to you.

"
9xquf0,"**Edit**: After talking with OP in other comments, he told me that he did not actually say ""jerked around"" to her. More along the lines of ""I'm fine waiting until you're up for things again, but its tough on me when it really gets my hopes up for things and they aren't going to happen.""

That being said, he is NOT an asshole. I based a lot of my judgement on him saying that he told her he felt ""jerked around"" which I felt was a shitty way to communicate his frustration.

She's trying to feel sexy now. For herself. So she can get into the mood. For you.

~~Yeah. You're an asshole here.~~ She's doing her best to get ""back to normal"" in your eyes. Sure, as a dude I totally understand how you feel. 

You need to put your feelings aside though. Your wife is on medication which is making her life difficult in some areas. Be a fucking teammate. Don't bitch when you don't get sex because you felt led on when she was simply trying to feel sexy in a situation where she hasn't felt that way recently. 

I don't think you had any ill intentions to begin with but telling her you felt jerked around is a fucking moron move. 

Do you not understand what it's like for people who are on anti depressants? I gather she is probably seeing someone in order to get those, probably not just a general doctor. If she has a therapist or psychologist maybe you BOTH need to go in for a visit and talk about some shit so you can understand what your life partner is going through.

Your post doesn't make it sound like you give a shit that this is really difficult for her.


"
9xqxxe,"NTA. You stood up for what you believe in, didn't get taken advantage of, and gave them the opportunity to work it out on their own. Pretty damn diplomatic. "
9xr7yc,NTA. Your manager is weird. And also sounds like a poor manager. 
9xrdac,"Traditionally the host provides the main meat. BUT that doesn’t mean it has to be that way. If your mom isn’t complaining then you shouldn’t either. It IS a lot of work just having a group over. Tons of cleaning and preparing tables/chairs. Plus tons of cleanup/dishes or cost if purchasing heavy paper plates/silverware etc. decorations. 

I would urge you to find things to be grateful for with this aunt. After all, it’s THANKS giving 

Edit-NTA but in need of attitude improvement "
9xrhe9,"You aren't the asshole here at all, no way.

For starters you shouldn't have been told anything, you should have  been asked.

Next, your boyfriend should have considered how you felt about this whole thing. Completely disregarding how you feel and calling you a asshole is completely unacceptable.

If he's living *with you* and you guys aren't sharing the place, I would consider telling him he doesn't get to make decisions like that without consulting you and in the future if he does it again he can find somewhere else to live."
9xrhrc,"NTA

S925 could also stand for Scandinavian Silver but since it feels thin and ""painted"", it is probably chinese silver. But you could do the test: Heat it up or treat it with chemicals, if the ring turns somewhat greenish with a bit of orange its fake.

If the turns black its real silver.

By trying to buy you something as a gift or as a surprise, there is always the chance that you won't like it. You should have been upfront with her but that is really the only ""fault"" you did.

As you said go to an event together for that money or just find a pair of rings together that you both like.

&#x200B;

For a ring she has paid over 50 Buchs on it definitely should not feel the way you are describing it.

Its not your fault for not liking the ring.

And its really not her fault when she was tricked into buying fake jewellery her intentions clearly were nice."
9xrl0e,NTA... you don't need that negativity in your life.
9xrqv9,"NTA, having an operation is not a free pass to walk all over you. "

9xruay,NTA. Nobody else was affected and you still got a good grade. 
9xrwu1,100 percent NTA. Kids can be vicious and theres nothing wrong with not wanting kids you don't like anyways to come over.
9xsj4z,"Yes yta, she did it to you so she's an ass as well. Sending that message probably gave her a sense os satisfaction that you still haven't gotten over it and think about her enough to even bother. "
9xsqjr,"Yta, not your house. It’s your moms house, they are your moms dogs. You brought up your concerns once, that’s enough now. Regardless of how you feel, she loves those dogs. She doesn’t view them to be as much of a hassle as you seem to. They are her pets. Drop it and move on. "
9xssts,"Hell no. If that's the type of person she is, you have no obligation to stay with her. I mean you have no obligations in general, but especially not here"
9xsybc,Your friend is a huge asshole. Get rid of them. The fact you are even considering paying for her ticket is absurd. 
9xt3kh,"NTA for not wanting to be physical. Hopefully that'll turn around for you if you can get a workable treatment for PCOS.

NTA for dumping him. He has an addiction and, like most addicts, lied about being willing to be treated. At that point it's not on you to stay with someone you can't trust.

YTA for being upset about porn in general. People watch porn. Men and women. It doesn't make people dirty to want to have a visual, or a audio, or written stimulous while getting off. As long as they're not addicted, and most porn consumers are not, there's no harm in it.

Remember, you've been dealing with a low sex drive. Your ex was dealing with an addiction. Neither is the norm for relationships. Someone with a normal sex drive, and no addiction, can watch porn to get off. It's a release, a way to relax, and even a way to keep from having premarital sex. It's not cool to be down on people for doing something alone, in private, that is hurting no one."
9xt3tq,"If you basically escalated to that without first trying to persuade him, as a friend to a friend would, then YTA. 

&#x200B;

Shitty situation though and he's definitely an asshole though for doing that, especially without consulting you first."
9xt71z,"Probably yes, YTA. 

Did you pay attention to who got them.  Give sour candies to 13 years olds - fun, not an asshole. 

Give them to 3 or 4 years olds who cant read and wont know what they are, yes, huge asshole move. 

Also selfish asshole move for doing it motivated by wanting to eat the good candy yourself and pawn off the sour stuff on unsuspecting children. "
9xtkun,"If its hazardous to be outside then the asshole move would be subjecting your dog to such conditions. 

They may not like it, but it's for their own good. Just be sure to poop your dog and maybe go out extra long when the air cleans up. 

NTA"
9xtn2r,"Oh poor you, you had to wash the dishes after saying you would wash them. YTA."
9xtni2,"YTA. People like you are why fathers are afraid of being alone with their child in public and probably why he looked so nervous. There's nothing wrong with a parent being affectionate with their kid. 

0% chance you would have done the same if it was a mother with their daughter. You made them both feel shitty and delayed the schedules of about 40 people because you made up a scenario in your imagination that obviously the man has to have evil intentions. "
9xto3m,Nope. NTA. 
9xtv5y,Absolutely. Pets sleeping on you > literally anything else. They're too pure
9xtxs6,"yes yta for not tipping, unless the service was exceptionally bad, or if u live in a place where waitresses dont rely on tips. "
9xu5cv,"NTA. Fuck that dude for using ""depression"" as an excuse. He clearly doesnt WANT to get better and will only continue to be a shitty person and hide behind it. "
9xuld9,NTA. You did what you had to for your own well-being. 
9xum6w,NTA Especially since you only asked them to pitch in what they'd normally have paid for the bus.

9xv50x,You obviously know you are not. 
9xvaz0,"NTA. If it makes you feel safer, do it! There's nothing weird about it at all, don't know why your boyfriend is giving you such a hard time about it. It's really not a big deal.

You're not on your phone or anything. You're not distracted. You're simply glancing at other drivers around you, and you say it's saved you from 3 collisions already? No asshole here."
9xvgp9,I mean I agree he’s NTA but it’s his brother’s birthday. To me that’s more important than a party if you’re just looking at it without the other details. In this situation he already paid for stuff so there’s really nothing OP can do without losing money I assume
9xvk7x,"Idk I’ve been in this situation before and his friend is kind of the asshole. He know OP couldn’t afford it and still pressured him to order something. Saying “don’t order anything” is easier said than done because then you’re drawing attention to the fact that you can’t afford it. I agree his friend shouldn’t have to pay for OPs food, but he also shouldn’t put (or let his wife put) OP in the position where he’s uncomfortable"
9xvkfa,"Depends on how long the queue for the girls bathroom was. If hers was like an hour and yours was 10 minutes using the other bathroom is something completely normal. At least here in Germany, no matter your gender."

9xvvbc,"Take the better job, without regrets but possibly a mild apology.  You owe your future to you."
9xvvdk,Ur NTA for worrying about the high likelihood that a couple breaking up after moving in together and the potential financial implications there are for ALL of you
9xvyt6,"NTA. As a female I can understand why your SO might feel insecure about this but you are definitely NTA. This is just one of those situations where you know you're wrong for feeling some kinda way about something so you have to rationalise it with yourself. Honestly I do it all the time. Talk to her and have her understand that you aren't trying to invalidate her feelings but she has to know that you wasn't trying to be disloyal to her in any way. If you had hidden it she'd have more grounds for being upset but you were upfront and honest.

Sometimes I feel intimidated by guys who stop me and display an interest in me. If other methods of getting away from them fail, I just take their number and say I'll call them. I always tell my boyfriend that I've taken some random dude's number just to get rid of them and he is ok with this. Any understanding partner will make allowances for things you do to make situations easier for yourself, such as getting a ride when it's cold. "
9xw1a0,"Not the asshole.  And your title is wrong.  Your wife (and dog) are your family, your parents are the family you came from.  You would  be a super asshole if you choose to make your family unhappy simply to make some one else happy.  If anyone gives you static just remember that your wife is your family, period."
9xw2wr,"NTA. Its a request, not a demand or anything you're not an asshole for politely asking something. 

I would suggest being prepared with alternative methods for keeping warm, actually demonstrating the temperature in your room, and explaining that you have to cool the room .down with whatever methods in order to sleep   
Consider also of you would accept a room switch. Maybe heat just gathers there and it's genuinely much cooler in another bedroom, so maybe there's a roomie who would love the temp you're sleeping in while you'd love the one he's got. "
9xwabq,"A. Your formatting is weird. FYI

B. NTA
"
9xwclr,"NTA , but I think you know that in all honesty. What that guy did was beyond me wrong and although some could argue violence is never the answer this dude deserved it. You should have told the principal though"
9xwgfj,"NTA, she needs to live alone"
9xwkwv,"NTA in the slightest, I think you handled it with a good sense of humor. "
9xwnsl,"Nta, go spend time with your family "
9xwtjs,"You’re not obliged to be in a relationship and you can break it off for whatever you want.

But the issue here is not her sexual history, it’s your own insecurities."
9xx6og,Is your boyfriend the president by chance?
9xx80j,You’re NTA but damn dude. You know you don’t get along with your dad - he gave you a nice gift and a few months you give it away? That’s literally the exact opposite of what you ought to do. You’ve gotta use a little more emotional intelligence than that!
9xxpis,"NTA. You’re being a good person, your friend is an asshole. "
9xxvz8,"NTA for being annoyed and getting the drunk strangers out of your home to catch some sleep.

YTA for taking the bed sheets off your GF and putting them in another room. That's just being petty."
9xy4ei,"You're kind of an asshole. To be frank, you come across as clingy, whiny, and immature in this post. Good news: it's fixable.

>i have managed to call her every night even when she was 3 hours away. and that really meant a lot to me. the being able to say goodnight every night.

Then, you say:

>this morning she told me she doesn't want to wait for me after my shift at work ... i put so much effort into doing that for her for so long.

So which is it? Either the nightly phone call was for her benefit, and she gets to call the shots regarding the phone call... or it's for you, and you're butt-hurt that your girlfriend wants to switch up the routine so she can be mentally and physically healthy.

It's called compromise. Find another time to get together, if you can. If it really is that important to you, communicate that respectfully to your girlfriend. Just don't discount her wants/needs when you have that talk, though."
9xy7z8,NTA. He's toxic and he has no problems lying and cheating. Cut him loose.
9xy8lj,"NTA, but it sounds like your misinterpreting why your friend was annoyed. You think it’s because you didn’t show up, but reading this it sounds like  they where annoyed that you didn’t seem to deem it important to let your friend, who was expecting you, know you wouldn’t be there. "
9xyq06,NTA. She sounds like a terrible person. 
9xzera,"YTA.

I know parents dating can be hard an uncomfortable, but you would be the asshole if you asked her to stop dating him for the reasons you've mentioned.  Your mom is an adult, and she almost certainly knows better than you what's good for her right now.  Definitely talk to her about why you might be uncomfortable, but don't presume to tell her that you know her needs better than she does."
9xzjle,"YNTA. You need to look out for yourself in this situation. Regardless of whether the owner is a good guy or not, it's not your responsibility to be worrying about the success or failure of his business. "
9xzl3i,NTA. First of all you can’t tell your pregnant at one week. There’s no way. Secondly a pregnancy has nothing to do with being on your phone and not getting your work done. You’re at work and a job needs to get done.
9xzm2a,"NTA, it sounds to me like your feelings are legitimate and justified. "
9xzmlx,"YTA. Not a terrible person but you should do research on places before making a reservation. Surely they had a website with the menu and prices. Or a yelp page.

And if they don’t have the prices up don’t go"
9xzumi,"I'd have to say YTA if you go through with it, at least right away. She's clearly not in a healthy state of mind to be giving consent, and if she's relying on you for housing that introduces a very significant power imbalance to the relationship, even if you would never knowingly use it to manipulate her. It just sounds like a dangerous situation for both of you, emotionally and potentially legally. Let her regain some stability before pursuing anything."
9y06hb,NTA. He's already 21 and isn't taking responsibility for his own life and well being. I understand why you feel bad but what you did was justified. 
9y0gpm,As long as you don't yell at them and keep it civil when you tell them your NTA. I understand the feeling and slowly thought that I didn't matter. When I figured it out I realised that I did matter just not as much as I thought. 
9y0h0x,"If you take her virginity knowing she wants something more then you would be an asshole. So I think it's right you haven't. 

However, I don't think you need to tell her that you aren't attracted to her, just say you're not looking for something serious so you feel it's better if she waited for someone on the same page."
9y0kp9,"You are not an asshole, but you should find some coping mechanisms. Don't say that you are ok when you aren't. Don't be afraid to say ""I need to be alone for 15, I'll be right back"" or to go to the bathroom or something. Therapy would probably do you good. "
9y0lc3,You’re both assholes. 
9y0mw2,"YTA. You clearly don’t care enough about these people to do things normal friends do, like respond to their messages without being forced. It doesn’t have to be immediate. It doesn’t seem like it has anything to do with proximity, because you’re talking about online messaging. It’s not wrong when it’s actually about distance, but if you’re going to add people online and say you’re their friend, distance is no longer an issue and they deserve a response."

If you're freeloading off your friend, YTA."
9y1mkr,"Your not the asshole for not telling your girlfriend about your babysitter. However you are the asshole for stalking your girlfriend. 

It’s harsh to say this, but this relationship and how you were kind of obsessed with her because she resembled your former babysitter who rape you is not healthy. "
9y1nua,"NTA Even if it didn't really affect you it wouldn't make you an asshole. I've seen people use different stuff like this (a classmate used the a death by cancer as her topic) multiple times and they're in their right to use it. 

There is nothing wrong with using it as your topic or main focus "
9y1suz,"NTA, but bruh will all do respect you have to have some respect for yourself here. She’s not even “letting” you eat breakfast, shower OR accompany your roommate to the fucking HOSPITAL cause you wouldn’t go along with a childish prank, and she’s doing so by holding your relationship hostage. That sounds incredibly manipulative, and I’m not telling you to dump her, but you can’t tolerate that shit, for your own good."
9y1ymm,"A is the asshole here. 

Being a DM requires a lot of planning and thinking and overall effort to try to make things work even when the party members are being silly or just plain dumb. He did not only appreciate the time and effort you put into being the DM even when it wasn't your turn (specially under such short notice) but he's also acting like a baby.

Props to you for making a campaign under an hour. "
9y202b,"Asshole.  Cleaning the hair out of the shower is a common courtesy when you share a shower.  Yes, it takes time, but it's not a waste of time.  It's gross, even if it's not technically ""dirty.""  "
9y2111,"Yeah I’d say YTA

Relationships are mutual and this is for her and you seem to be worried about how what she wants will ruin what you want. 

Other than the fertility issue most of your reasons seem really selfish "
9y269x,"NTA. Though, grandparents are tricky. I stopped talking to my Grandfather when i was a teenager, it's tough, but I also wasn't the only person to do so. Have you talked to other family members, one who agrees/ one you trust? "
9y29rw,NTA. Doesn't sound like a friend to me either.
9y2alh,"Eh I don't know if you're an asshole but I think as you grow older a part of maintaining friendships is being okay with people outside your group that they date.

It can be very hurtful if it feels like your friends don't like your SO.

If their behavior is truly making you all uncomfortable maybe address the behavior directly rather than saying he shouldn't bring her.

Last point is if they just started dating they're in the honey moon phase which will not last forever"
9y2bfd,"You're not in a place to take vacations yet you don't get why your wife is upset your dad pays to fly *you* down while she stays home? Yeah, you're the asshole. 

It sound like your wife resents that you get free vacations while she works. I don't blame her."
9y2c3p,"YTA. Dont do it. If she's willing to cheat on him, you'll be next."
9y2das,"NTA and it's clear his friend thinks so, too, if he's suggesting your bf take you out. Dude is clearly not aware at all. You need to have a conversation with him, especially as he lied about the hotel stay."
9y2fla,"NTA, I understand that you were excited and wanted to spend this occasion with them, and they have a reputation to miss events, but are you looking into the big picture? 

What are they missing the events for?
Do they have enough funds to attend these events or to pay for their cut?
Do they have other friend groups? 

I don't think going off on them was the best option, and I think you should apologise. But actually get answers as well, explain that your sad that you don't get to spend time with them, or you really wanted them there for these events. 
"
9y2h10,"Is she TA for caring about his health?

[IK this is a long shot, but hear me out] What if he was a drug user, and at first they both used drugs recreationally, like they just smoked weed or did cocaine together on occasion and it was fun and it’s a way they bonded in their relationship. 

But upon moving in with him, she learned that not only does he do drugs everyday, but it’s way harder stuff than she was expecting. Would she be the asshole for trying to get him off drugs? Or at least use less drugs? 


It just comes down to health, and yeah it his health and his choice to eat like shit, but is she TA for taking his best interests to heart? That’s what girlfriends/partners are supposed to do. 

"
9y2j0i,Are you seriously asking if you can be friends with girls lol
9y2uwb,"NTA. Your abusive dad and enabling mom are the assholes here. You should never have to be surprised by a chat with your abuser, but your mom keeps doing it to you. "
9y2x5t,"Sounds like both of you were assholes in that situation.

The woman, for intentionally bumping into you multiple times

It was nice of you to actually give the money back though, although it is kind of understandable that he would be mad that he needed some money back and you initially refused. However, I don't know what he needed the money for, if it was for something he needed like to help pay for groceries or something it was a bit mean of you to refuse.

Never mess with people’s food at a restaurant. 

He said he’d look the other way. He would have if nothing happened.

If something had seriously gone wrong (allergic reaction, provable food poisoning, someone ratted you out, etc) he would’ve thrown you under the bus. If he (the customer) was a good man or a horrible man, you would suffer the consequences. The public will believe the manager over you by default.

 You volunteered. Did she know you came straight from work? Did she ask you to volunteer? Did you thank her for working when she has stuff on in the morning? Why do you think you were helping her out when you volunteered to be a bartender at social club? Why should the person carrying you have to pat you on the back and say thank you for it? 

You aren't entitled to others appreciation just because you want it. Especially when they have no say in you doing the thing in the first place. 

A thank you would be nice, sure. But it seems you are after this girls affection and want her attention. Something you aren't entitled too and unless you say she probably isn't going to be aware of.

9y6gav,"NTA, not sure if the hitler quote was called for, but whatever, let me break it down.

Your relationship is clearly a funnel, where everything goes to jake side, he’s the kind of person who loves the banter but can’t take the heat, and because everything within your relationship has been always on his favor he reacted that way when you stopped putting up with it

The first red flag should have been him purposely “forgetting” the metal detector, although, may I dare to ask what ages were you two when you were attending school? I can picture this “ass-pranking” in tweens and below, but in late high schoolers seems pretty weird.

I think everything boils down to a question: how are you benefiting from this friendship with jake? From how you are describing it, it seems like he is more of a liability than friend, and he doesn’t seem to care about it as you keep enabling his behavior.

So if the effort of putting up with him surpasses the joy of spending time with him, I suggest to move on, when that line is crossed the friend status isn’t valid anymore, just stick with people you enjoy being around of"

Having said that, you are basically saying that you want some of your friends to give up their annual party because you’d rather have pizza and play games the only night that everyone is available. I know it’s your 30th birthday, and everyone else has been able to have theirs celebrated how they want, but it doesn’t sound like any of them happened to have a conflict like this arise (I assume you’d have mentioned it if they did). And it sounds like you’ve built up this low key birthday idea into something really important. But at the end of the day, it seems a little unfair to ask people to give up an annual tradition that can only be had one night because you want to do pizza and game night, which can usually be arranged pretty easily.

I guess what I’m saying is that it seems like you’re putting your desire for the day over the desires of several of your friends (or to put it a little more harshly, saying you think you’re more important than they are). And again, I know it’s your birthday, and I can understand feeling like your desires should be afforded a little more importance on that day, but I think part of growing up kind of means accepting that a birthday is really just another day and doesn’t make us more important than others.

I’m curious where you’re going- why don’t you look up things to do there (besides the typical touristy stuff), I’m sure you can find something you’d enjoy doing there. Try to make an effort to actively participate in family time. Just my 2 cents! "

9ymnk9,"As long as you don't invalidate your family's feelings, NTA. You don't know her, of course you aren't distraught. "
9ymok6,"NTA for being annoyed, potentially the asshole depending on how you yelled at her over this mildly annoying thing. "
9ymw9k,"NTA

You needed to get yourself out of a dangerous situation. It’s really unfortunate about your mom, but you staying there isn’t going to help and it’s just going to endanger you and your sister. Be ready to help if your mom asks for it, but you can’t make her ask or want it, unfortunately. "
9yn1tf,"NTA. Also, you're not her therapist. It's completely inappropriate for her to treat you like one, especially if what you say is true about how she's treated you in the past."

9yo4g1,"NTA. She clearly stole it and is trying to defuse the situation by saying she’ll repay what you “think” she stole, rather than just admit to the whole thing and say sorry. That’s some manipulation right there, to make you feel bad for wanting repayment. I’d seriously make her repay you though, regardless of how she phrased it. "
9yocgn,"You're not the asshole. People who change plans and conveniently ""forget"" to mention that to all parties annoy me to death.

Long post short, you may have behaved inappropriately in destroying his stuff (demonstrating that, when mad, it's appropriate to display your anger through destruction) but you had a *damn* good reason. Being a dad is tough, being a *single dad and widower* is unspeakably difficult. What you do from here on out with him could prove to shape his future, just stay strong man. "
9ypsdp,Asshole. Get better at the class or fail. Don't push that onto someone you apparently care for.

9yq9ej,"NTA, I'm surprised you even stayed with him after that, especially since you seem to be still effected by what he's done. If he's done it to you once, he'll probably do it to you again. What you did was an honest mistake, but he has no excuse for getting so shitfaced that he got lost in a park then beat you. Inexcusable. "
9yqwfm,"Your friend is allowed to be upset and offended.  You might not be TA for making the joke originally, but YTA for continuing to make the joke after she asked you to stop. Also, YTA for saying it's not a big deal, when it's obviously a big deal to the person who is the butt of your joke. 

Your friend could be privately struggling with her sexuality and you making it into a joke could be making things more confusing for her.

9ys3jj,"Not an asshole for wanting to break up. You're an asshole for the way you did it. Even a ""I can't be with you anymore, please don't contact me"" and then blocking her would have been better. "

However, YTA for not thinking she’s your equal. She is going to school. Assuming she will graduate and get a job when she does, she will be bringing in money. Your relationship is a partnership and sometimes one person takes on more of a burden for a time for a better payoff. You’re not looking to the future and it’s kinda messed up to see her not as equal to you.

Your brother seems to be going on the wrong path and it doesnt seem like homeschool is the best idea, especially since your mom has a past of being abusive. 

Honestly it really seems like shes trying to manipulate you so if you say no, your the big bad guy that wouldn't help her poor mom. Your mom is an adult and should've prepared for this type of thing in advanced. A retirement should've been established if she could afford multiple vacations. "

9yxja0,"YTA imo, gossip is quite normal for humans, and this was completely harmless. Why did you tell her this? Was it really that big of an issue, worth fucking over your friend for?"

9yxpa9,">My mother was to give some of his estate to me, according to my grandfather’s intentions.

Was that actually specified in his will?

>I do not come first in her eyes.

Considering the fact that ""she lives in a motel with two kids and her husband"", I honestly don't blame her.  The kids living with her should come first in her eyes, because she's still 100% responsible for providing for them.

>So AITA for expecting my family to help out?

Mildly, yes.  You're not the asshole for *hoping* for her to help out, but it's not something that you should *expect* (unless it was clearly specified in your grandfather's will).  She has her own situation to contend with, after all.  And frankly, it's bad form to ever ""expect"" an inheritance."

9yxpy1,Why is Starbucks even open on Thanksgiving? Call in sick bro it's not worth it
9yxsu9,"1) If your mother decided to host thanksgiving at her house after you invited her, NTA. I don't blame your mother either, as it's probably a strong part of her at this point to host thanksgiving.

2) YTA for inviting your aunts and cousins. I know it probably wasn't your intention, but it makes it seem (to your aunts and cousins) like you don't care that your mother would be having thanksgiving alone, had they accepted your invitation."
9yy6go,"No one looks great here, but what it comes down to is you shouldn’t ever expect a free service out of someone. If you want to pay for a sitter or daycare and cut your mom out, that’s in your right to do. But have you talked to her about this at all? “Hey, Mom, I’ve noticed you never want to see son unless you’re getting paid to babysit. I’m feeling hurt by this. Can we talk about it?”"
9yy9a2,"Either way, she was driving recklessly and potentially putting others at risk.

And you legitimately thought the other driver was under the influence of alchohol, so no, you are in no way the asshole."
9yyb5u,"First, never lend money to friends or family unless you're prepared to never see that money again.

Second, you're under no obligation to lend money if it would hurt you to not have that money, as in not being able to eat or make rent.

9yyl92,"It's completely normal to think about other people when you're in a relationship, so YTA if you expect him to never do that.

As far as him thinking about other women *while* you're having sex, that's actually fairly fucked up. He's the asshole, there."
9yynbe,"I don’t think you’re an asshole, but you can’t force him to communicate if he doesn’t want too. Maybe the best course of action is to take a step back, put your efforts towards some other friends that will reciprocate. "
9yyrrn,Sounds to me like he was trying to do this in the kindest way he possibly could. Your vagina should not have a strong odor and if it does hes not un the wrong for being concerned about your health. Breaking things off over this is absolutely immature. I wouldnt say you're an asshole persay; but learn to take some criticism. You're not perfect and hes allowed to be uncomfortable with your scent if it's that strong and off putting that he things theres something wrong. See a dr first; then maybe do some introspective thought and grow up a hair.

9yyw8w,"NTA, can’t choose your family but you sure as hell can choose what to do about them "
9yz78c,"NTA... your sister has no nuance and is overreacting imo. It’s perfectly reasonable to offer people their money back , like you said, the original cause is gone and they might not want to donate to the new one. I’m sorry she’s treating you so rough. This really didn’t need to be such a big deal "
9yz9k8,"Some people just care more about that shit. I had a friend refuse to do any part of the driving on a road trip bc her name wasn't on the insurance for the rental, and while it didn't feel like a big deal to me and I thought it was dumb, she wasn't being an asshole, she was conforming to the law at her level of comfort. And so were you. 
I feel like there's a few options here. Your girlfriend probably should've been aware that you're that kind of person already (in which case YNTA and either she is, or you guys just didn't know each other well enough), OR you're not usually that kind of person and it's just that you used that as an excuse bc you didn't want her driving your car (in which case YTA). "
9yzjsq,"I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA, as long as you refused in a polite manner.

Of course, your parents might regrettably not give you a choice in the matter.

You might need to endure it for your parents' sake, and I suggest you try and seeing their side of things, but I don't think you're an asshole for being bothered by it. Even if your parents bought the bed, ""your bed"" is still understandably something intimate to you."
9yzkes,"NTA, this sounds some petty shit.  Your neighbor did a nice thing for yall and you are doing one back.  Your roommate should be happy that you actually went out of the way to get your neighbor a gift.  Getting a gift for your neighbor should not make her feel insignificant(thats her own fault I literally so no way it can make her feel like that).  Thanks for being a nice person though!  It feels great when someone does something good for  you back when you helped them out!"
9yzoqd,"NTA. Heck, she wanted you to move out, she was a sneaky little asshole about it, what did she think was going to happen?"
9yzsvb,"YTA for making her feel shitty about herself in the beginning, but for this specific instance I think you’re just clueless. NTA, but maybe unintentionally callous. 

She didn’t show you some random girl, this was a friend of hers on Facebook. She is obviously someone your girlfriend feels less than and is an object of comparison for her. To you this girl means nothing, but to your girlfriend she is significant. I mean, she keeps bringing her up. And by you looking her up, your girlfriend had some confirmation that you find this other girl pretty, and based on her own comparisons against this girl, it confirms that she is not as good as this girl in your eyes. You were a dick in the beginning with your girlfriend, but completely accepting and praising of this girl you’ve never even seen in real life. 

Idk how to fix it but having an open convo with your girlfriend could be helpful. "
9yzxw7,"She was drunk, and just sat there frozen? That doesn't sound like cheating, that sounds like she was assaulted. Jesus. Freezing is a really common reaction to high stress situations. You should talk to her about how she feels about what happened."

9z0omk,NTA. You're just *doing you* and being very respectful about it
9z0qqn,Because it's a lot to suddenly pile onto a 13 year old and will destabilize her life. Suddenly her extended blood family who are practically strangers no doubt wanting to know about her and pry into her life which she might not be comfortable with. It's really her secret to tell when she see's fit as she is the one most effected by this.
9z0zen,NTA - it’s not like you’re on holiday you’re ill. Also leaving a woman with gastroenteritis to cook and wash dishes is how everyone gets gastroenteritis... 
9z12m6,"first I want to  clarify, Tim did not want to sleep with me. or at least he did but he canceled it a day later before anything happened. I think he canceled specifically because he wanted to date sally. If you are referring to the possibility then yeh you are right I should do that. Overall thank for the thoughtful advice! I think im homoflexible but who knows honestly. As for the kiss thing... at the time im pretty sure I did not want to push it, but I did think I brought it up. I also waited until she approached me and then I made another push to set the date. And thank you for the go ahead now, I just would really feel weird if I did end up dating her though, like I betrayed the bro code or something because im basically rubbing it in his face or something. I also do want to stay friends with him but if he isn't reaching out back... well that's when I stop. I will reach him in the middle but I wont walk the whole football field for him. Thank you for the reminder of safe sex. duly noted. overall thank you again, though."

If your FIL had a problem with the money he shouldn't have given it to you in the first place. 

That said, you didn't handle it the best way possible, so I would say you're a little bit the asshole for the reaction. "
9z25yr,"NTA 

Even if she had MS, how she treated your still emotionally, financially and physically scarred you. If it is true, it's an explaination but it's not an excuse. Her actions, though she may not have been in control, still fucked you up.

You don't owe your ex girlfriend anything. You are not responsible for her.  In fact, her apologising to you is still selfish because she's breaking a boundary that you've established when you blocked her on everything.

It's time to put your needs first and consider what you need to heal for your own mental health. Do not reply. Do not feel bad. She can take care of herself.  "
9z29hx,YTA. Destroying someone’s car can never be justified. 
9z2ldr,"She's an asshole and needs to piss or get off the pot.

9z49po,"Dude, seriously. A firm “hey, you aren’t someone I want to be married to. This is over.” is all you owe her. It does make you an asshole (and a flake) to ghost someone you were engaged to. 

Edited to add: it’s okay and totally healthy to realize you aren’t equipped to deal with her. You do owe her a breakup, but how you choose to do it is up to you."
9z4f5q,NTA. Everybody else involved in convo ITA. What does your weight have to do with video game character discussion?

Don't talk to her if you dont like it. "
9z5kiv,"You’re not necessarily an asshole for thinking that privately to yourself or even confiding with your friends or strangers. But as soon as you say that to someone who loves the kid, (like your dad,) then YTA. "
9z5x2m,"Yta, but not for the reason you think. The whole “I support all human rights” thing in response to someone posting about trans people can come across similar to “All lives matter” in response to BLM. Like, obviously all people matter. But in this case it’s referring to a specific issue affecting a specific group. 

Also... don’t use furries as a group to support when talking about people’s gender identities. Sexuality and gender are very different beasts. "
9z60jg,"NTA. You have plans with your dad which she knows, and if she wanted to see you more she could call or visit whenever since she's so close. "
9z613a,"NTA for the things you felt/feel and the meaning behind the words. Y sorta TA for saying it the way you did. 

As frustrating as she was being, she feels responsible for you now because of your dad. She thought she'd already failed, and something happened to you. 

You need to have a nice sit down with her and explain things like this to her. That her worrying is great, but there's going to be times you don't reply immediately. 

Your dad kinda seems like an asshole for what he said, though. "
9z61yl,YTA. I pretty much agree with your friends.
9z6307,"YTA because you are holding something against her that happened when you were not together. She was a single woman, which was a direct result of a choice you made, and therefore you cannot view it as some way of cheating. You can't have your cake and eat it to you. 

Also, to date someone with the intention of one day ending it (ie: ""you would not want to marry her some day"") means you are just using her right now. Which makes you a very big asshole. Especially knowing she does see herself marrying you one day. 

Having said all that, you breaking up with her because of how you feel about this would make you NTA, it would be the right thing to do because its something you can't get over. I and others may not agree with it, but that doesn't matter, its what you do knowing how you feel about it that determines if you are the asshole or not. Don't string her a long just cause you enjoy her company now but know you are going to eventually end it one day. She does not deserve that just because she did something you didn't like when ya weren't together. "
9z637x,"NTA. she was using you as a shoulder to cry on when she needed one. as soon as she didn't need you, she completely pushed you out of her life until she needed a shoulder to cry on again. you tried to cry on her shoulder and she walked away. this is not a reciprocal relationship and thats not how functioning relationships work"
9z63bv,"Honestly, no, you are not. The guy is clearly in the wrong for bailing on the group. However, I do believe you might of have confronted him about it earlier on (if it had been possible). "
9z6dp1,"No, you're good. Ignore and move on. He knows where the game is and where it can be picked up."
9z6ehy,"I think you WBTA, but a justified one.

Is the parking restriction enforceable in any way? If so I suggest you go through the proper avenues to deal with this situation."
9z6j3i,"Being a bit cocky about your promotion means that you already know that you're a bit of an asshole.  I think your coworker is probably  jealous and I understand her reaction.  Being her supervisor now, I'd say your cockiness is also a bit unprofessional."
9z6qdv,"NTA, she is. I have insomnia too and that’s no reason to act like that. You dodged a bad one there. Not a great choice breaking up over text but that’s not what you’re asking about and you already know it was a bad choice. "
9z79jd,"NTA. It sounds like your girlfriend is watching too many rom-coms, and it’s really immature that she finds the notion of two guys fighting over her appealing. If you really love your partner, you wouldn’t fall in love with someone else. Why should you fight for someone who doesn’t truly love you?"
9z7cpg,"Oh god you are so NOT the Asshole and I only read the first few paragraphs.  This is literally NOT a LGBTQA issue.  It's about lying.  
  
>  some of the stuff I said, like **I couldn't wait to taste her pussy**, etc. it was pretty clear what my expectations were at this point.  
  
> As we were getting naked, she unzips her dress and I see she's wearing pads on her hips, a waist cincher, and when she takes off her panties, **she has a penis**.
  
She lied.  
  
> she's partially right  
  
No she's not.  She lied.  Just because her excuses for the lie are factual statements (""I'm trans, you're not, blah blah blah"") does not justify the lie.  
  
> She accused me of lying... ...when I said I was excited to go down on her earlier that night  
  
Oh, so she heard that?  While she was dancing around with a penis?  And then she let you walk all the way back to her place, back upstairs, get naked, and then BOOM penis time?!  
  
It's like a guy saying ""I'm excited to take it slow with you tonight"" and then getting home and stripping naked and saying ""well if you actually loved me you'd be willing to fuck me!!""  
  
It's guilt tripping you.  It's manipulation.  It's a lie.  
  
>  She said she's sorry, that she overreacted, should have said something, etc. and that she wanted a second date to make it up to me. The thing is, I wasn't interested anymore as I felt like I couldn't trust her. I declined, and she called me a transphobic piece of shit  
  
LOL it's like the fucking script of /r/niceguys.  
  
""Oh I'm so sorry baby I love you let's try again""  
""ehhh idk ""  
""FUCK YOU STUPID WHORE""   
  
This is absurd!  LGBTQA people want to be treated as normal people because they're normal people.  Just like any population, some of them are overly dramatic attention-seeking assholes.  You met one.  Don't let this person abuse the movement for equal rights as leverage to manipulate you.  This person is a shithead and a giant asshole, and you don't owe her anything. 
  
You're not the Asshole.  "
9z7kjt,NTA. Fuck all that noise.
9z7pmz,"NTA.  The desires of your teenage daughter do not decide your actions.  Your Ex is of course going to seize whatever opportunity she is given to vilify you.  Together, they create a feedback loop that makes it sound like you're an asshole (but you're NOT).  That sucks.  
  
You got a ride for her but you couldn't have done it yourself.  It simply wasn't possible.  Driving 1hr20min is not feasible.  You had food on the stove.    It also seems like it was the mother's night, and therefore the mother's responsibility to collect the daughter.  
  
Your kid is going to look for any opportunity to claim you ""don't love them as much"" and they will use that excuse to get out of all kinds of parenting opportunities.  You shouldn't buy into it just to get your kids to like you.  You're their father, not their friend.  "
9z7uld,"NTA 

Nothing wrong with asking for compensation but I wouldn't push to hard for it if they say no. Might come off as your parents seeing it inconsiderate that you wouldn't want to watch him."
9z7vwk,"In that case, I'll reverse my decision.  I grew up with a family who all took care of some portion of the meal, so I kind of thought that was the norm.  If everyone is just leaving it to you to do all of the work, that makes *them* the assholes, not you."
9z7xes,"Yta. Even if she doesn't have anxiety, she certainly feels as though she needs to see a therapist. So there's some issues there, even if it's just trouble dealing with life. Which could develop into disorders. So yeah, either support her and encourage her to get help, or she needs better than you."
9z7ztl,"I certainly don’t think you’re an asshole or would be for asking the gift to be returned. There’s never a scenario that warrants someone being an asshole for not wanting to accept a gift. Especially something expensive like jewel wary that you don’t like. Just because your husband spent time and money finding one he likes doesn’t mean you should feel obligated to keep it. Sit him down and be honest with him that you don’t like jewelry and he shouldn’t pick those gifts out for you anymore. Return the gift for money or exchange it to buy something you like. What a waste if someone keeps something they don’t even like. Even if his ego gets bruised, it’s better for him to learn this instead of having your money in jewelry you don’t like. "
9z82nd,[deleted]
9z86hp,NTA for taking money gifted to you; YTA for expecting it as compensation 
9z8gbq,"NTA. If you dont want to be friends with someone, that's not a crime. Maybe just nicely let him know you already have plans on your birthday and cant see him that day. "
9z8ggo,"The real AITA would of been if you left the dog whit her 
You made some kids cry but you made a beautiful dog very happy 
Hopefully she doesn’t pay the 100$, it sounds like your family really cares about the dog 
In two or three weeks those kids won’t even remember they had a dog, seems like not even the woman remembered 
IMO you did the right thing 👍🏻"
9z8ivm,"YTA. If the smell of your feet is *that* strong that it's very noticeable, you need to find some sort of solution. "
9z8l75,I work in dementia care. You're doing the right thing. You are NTA.
9z8rf3,"Yes. 1000% yes. You should not be a medical professional. If you can’t bring yourself to treat someone properly, recuse yourself. "
9z8w5r,"Theres no asshole in this situation imo, you did something wrong, and it was an asshole move, but you're not an asshole for doing it because you didnt mean for everything to turn out the way it did "
9z92uz,"Nah, don't feel bad. $30 is a lot. It was nice you asked, but no one should be expected to keep on with that kind of thing."
9z9edf,"Are you the asshole for being pissed off at her comments and her failure to acknowledge how her words are impacting those around her? No, absolutely NTA. Depression is the asshole in this scenario. 

I think this is great opportunity for you and your friends to support this person who claims to be having a challenging time.  While someone else’s mental wellness isn’t your responsibility (assuming you aren’t actively trying to sabotage them), having a dialogue with your friend about her coping skills and self-regulation could be incredibly helpful her. She may not have the vocabulary, for example, to accurately describe or assess her emotions. 

It can be difficult to watch someone who outwardly appears to be “better off” than you as they complain or argue about how they’re struggling with the very same things you’re struggling with. The trouble is that you are both walking on different paths and have different life experiences. What might be a “level 6” pain for you could be a “level 10” pain for them because they’ve never experienced anything worse. And who knows, maybe she is experiencing a severe depressive episode and requires serious support. Imagine how it would feel if your friends/ peers dismissed your symptoms while you were being diagnosed. Depression is a lonely, fickle beast which is only worsened when  ignored or dismissed by others. 

Lastly, AND THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT, mental health and mental wellness aren’t the same thing. A person can have poor mental health as result of a disorder, but can enact habits and coping strategies to maintain strong mental wellness. Conversely (and this could possibly be happening with your friend) a person can have no metal conditions or disorders, but can experience feelings of anxiety and depression and have poor mental wellness. Think of it like a four quadrant graph with mental health as the X axis and mental wellness as the Y axis. (+,+) is someone with no mental health conditions or well treated conditions and strong wellness, (-,+) is someone with untreated or ineffectively treated mental health conditions and strong wellness, and so on. 

Be pissed. Feel unacknowledged. Roll your eyes on the inside. Then make sure your friend is safe and has the support of her peers. "
9z9jo4,"NTA, PETA is an awful organization and I wouldn't want people close to me supporting it"
9z9k0y,YTA because while you have 100% a right to not be ok with the situation you needed to make it clear to your girlfriend that it wasn't ok and she needed to do more to deal with it or that's the end of the relationship. Letting the cat get lost and punishing the animal was not an ok option.
9z9kff,Nta. Everyone needs space. She should respect that.
9z9n8z,"Well you were awkward but definitely not an asshole. It seems to me that from the beginning she was trying to let you down gently, when she should have been straight forward and said no to begin with. It's difficult for women to do that sometimes because some men don't take rejection well and we always have that in the back of our minds.

So yeah, not the asshole, and she's just not into you. I'd just steer clear altogether"
9za3mv,YTA but not for the reason you listed. You’re the asshole for not communicating how you feel to your GF. Walk in her shoes for a moment and think of why she would do that. She could have underlying anxiety issues and the verbal reminder that you love her can assuage those feelings. Maybe you can develop a more agreeable way to communicate those feelings. 
9za59n,"NTA. Seems really cringy. Like, I feel awkward and I wasn't there. "
9za700,NTA that shits gross. You communicated you didn’t like it and why and he chose to keep doing it. That’s just disrespectful at this point. 
9zaivt,Therapy.
9zaz9y,Nta enjoy
9zb80v,"If she’s bullying someone fuck her. YNTA

but usually something is behind the bullying (-some white lady) but 4 real, something could be up with her life"
9zb9wr,YTA. Wouldn't you want to know if you were her? What if she has kids with him *then* finds out he's a cheater? You can still redeem yourself though if you tell her!
9zbek2,"If you lent it to them - NTA , 
If you gave it to them - YTA

A gift is a gift. Maybe you could try sell the broken tv and wait for black friday deals? (if they have that in your country)

Edit; comma."
9zbmu8,"NTA. It might not have been that big of a deal to let those two girls cut in line, but once you say Yes once, other people will also want to. Also, the girls were being rude. "
9zbq2n,"Even if every single one of your neighbours had pets, it's not your responsibility to look out for them or after them. If they want you to do the side walk with pet safe salt, tell them to provide it "
9zbzaz,"I wouldn't call you the asshole, but I would call you liable to get assault charges tossed at you. 

Call the emergency number and when they answer immediately say non-emergency. If the non-emergency number isn't staffed, this is the proper way to handle it."
9zc8r0,"YTA by telling them playing it by ear but in reality just want to hook up, then you're lying to them and leading them on. Someone's emotional state is more important than you getting laid. I'm 20 years old and I'm seeing a women whose 24. If you're mature they will realize that and give you a chance, if they're hung up on age it could be 2 reasons  1 you're not as mature as you think or 2 they just hate dating younger men, which is reasonable. It's a social norm that women tend to date guys older than them."
9zcoke,Not the asshole. But it does come across as you liking her when you cancel after finding out her boyfriend is coming. 
9zcyl3,"It doesn't sound like you don't want to help someone, it sounds like you're angry people are getting any help at all, and for that you sound like a proper bitter arsehole.

Have you ever looked into mindfulness? I used to laugh at it but a few exercises really help me with my anger, I can recommend some apps or websites if you're ever interested."
9zd5cl,"You’re an asshole because a waitress is a captive audience and you were talking about a controversial subject that she cannot comment freely upon.  Ranting at the help is always an asshole move. 

Also your recounting of the story is completely unclear. Who the hell is helga? You seem super unstable and all over the place.
"
9zdd7j,"NTA, you guys arent dating her, you arent her therapists, and shes by no means earned ""shot caller"" status in what seems like a large group of friends.

Her insecurities, moral outrages, whining, and lack of a food palette isnt your problem. Honestly she sounds like the kind of person that ""just cant even"" and says she has anxiety/panic attacks but doesnt really in order to manipulate others into believing her shitty behavior is justified."
9zdh8d,[deleted]
9zdzfq,"YTA. In cases like this the right thing to do is be open with the instructor and file a clear, thorough group participation survey. If that fails, take it to the department. Hell, you should have gone to the instructor when they tried to plagiarize. 

If you're in a master's program you should know better than to sabotage shit."
9ze2hr,"You are definitely not the asshole. Your husbands friend sounds like a textbook narcissist and honestly any relationship with her is going to be extremely toxic. The even that you went to was not meant for her so there is no way you ruined her weekend by asking to do the things you wanted to.

On a side note who in the fuck tells a married couple she doesn’t want them to act like a couple when near her. I would laugh at anyone who asked me not to kiss my girlfriend around them."
9ze5iw,"NTA, but honestly neither is your father. It's not your car, he has no obligation to you as an adult to put himself out in anyway to get you what you need. I get why you are upset, but life is not the same as it was when this was first talked about, and obviously expectations have changed. 

Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on his. You've had 9 years to get your license, and have never bothered - only now when you need it in a rush are you looking to do it. 

Don't look at the situation as your father costing you hundreds of extra pounds and time - look at it as your years of procrastination costing you that. "
9ze5x3,"not the asshole, you just need to recognize that you shouldnt hate your boyfriend. if youve been a bit rude to him lately, i would just tell him about this. its kind of like when someone does something rude to you in a dream so you get mad at them in real life lol"
9zec50,NTA. She could've asked you nicely and you still wouldn't have been obligated to go out of your way to help her out.
9zegkg,"Yes, YTA. Telling someone you're in the shower is  not permission to fuck you. This is real life, not a porno, and if you actually think porno dialogue happens in real life, you're watching way too much porn. 

Not to mention, you keep bringing it up? Wtf is the point of that? You *want* your girlfriend to feel bad? For something she did years ago? Get off your obsessive high horse and shut up about it.

Edit: autocorrect thought not should be let"
9zew2z,"NTA I mean at least you tipped. As someone who has worked as a server and sucked at it, any kind of tip is alright. "
9zf2fj,"NTA. She has issues deeper than what you said. You have a right to stand up for yourself, and your feelings. She doesn’t have a right to treat you like shit because she’s depressed. It may not be intentional, and she may not realize she’s doing it. You may just want to talk to her and ask her about how she’s feeling, because she’s probably feeling a lot more than you think. "
9zf5iu,"This is a good one. NTA. Young kids are influenced by everyone around them, so it is possible that your daughter sees her cousin as elder and deems her behavior appropriate. Until your daughter can understand that it is not ok to act this way regardless of what somebody else does, you might be in the right here."
9zfdq3,"> I have a heart condition, and moderately severe muscular dystrophy.

Definitly NTA and I would sue the bus compagny."
9zfgbo,Nta. That's bullshit. They're taking over a whole other room that used to be shared. It really should be split 3 ways with you paying 1/3rd.
9zfmm2,"NTA. Here in Canada for example if you go to a restaurant and get take-out, you don't have to tip even if the payment machine (interac) prompts you for it. Some tip up to %5 on take-out, but usually it is not required.
"
9zfw26,"Fuck no, you’re NTA. 

You’re actually very mature for your age. Sorry you’ve had to see things that you shouldn’t have to at that age. "
9zg0e8,"nta, chaotic good"
9zg1h8,Nta.  He got expelled all on his own.
9zg4cd,"NTA, I grew up in a strict household too. It’s better to leave the nest.  "
9zg51b,"NTA -- Unless they completely apologize for their accusations, you shouldn't have anything to do with them.  Being accused of being a pedophile is about as serious an accusation as someone can make.  

That being said, have you told them why you don't want to come home for Thanksgiving?   "
9zg6f5,NTA. That’s weird. I would’ve just unfriended her a long time ago if I were you 
9zgikj,I don't know how truthful you're being. But if he said to give you an estimate and then just started working I would say NTA. 
9zglje,"YTA

You helped someone involved in organized crime continue to function. That's the bottom line. I don't care how you feel about police, what you did may have repercussions that affect the general public."

My grandmother has dementia so I know how hard it is. what stage is your mother in?"
9zgozu,"NTA. I’m so sorry that this is happening to you and your mom.

I have a few family members who struggle with alcoholism. It sucks because even after my particularly bad brother left years ago he’s got my mom up at night because she knows he’s on a bender and she’s worried he’ll die accidentally. It’s a sad and terrible thing. I hope your brother can find help from his addiction and I’m sorry you carry the burden of his problems as well."
9zgrez,NTA but you need to explain to him why she is not welcomed.
9zh1bn,"This is ridiculous, NTA. Since when were condoms an extension of one's self. Dude didnt even have to pay for them. Even if he had its all of $2. He's probably just projecting emotion from others issues surrounding the break up. "
9zh4h6,"YTA - He’s made his stance clear and you keep wanting to push it further. Sure, it’d be nice of him to do that, but by no means is it a requirement or expectation. It’s that you’re pushing it on him to the point of argument that makes YTA, not necessarily that you want him to watch it."
9zh5n9,[deleted]
9zhl1x,NTA. You’re not making her choose between you and her family. She already chose when she decided to go there without you and against your premade plans.

9zi82d,"I recently talked to the lady and she said that she took a picture of the number plate before the car drove off, and she showed the police and told them the whole story to which they said they would see if they could track down the car and ask a guy a few questions about the incident, I'll add to the post for when I get any updates"
9zicky,YTA. You slept in a bed alone together with a girl you told your GF you would want to fuck. Reverse the roles and ask yourself if you still think your GF is overreacting. 
9zifaf,"NTA, because I'm pretty sure Thanksgiving was ruined the moment you put a set foot in a Whataburger... on Thanksgiving."
9zimlg,NTA. Doesn't matter if he's the soulchild of Les Claypool; nobody wants or needs to be in a band with a cuntrail of that magnitude.
9zj43z,"You’re not, but you need to talk to your friend about it. "
9zj87v,"I don’t think there are enough details to really decide who’s the asshole here (is the TV in your bedroom, is it too loud, what’s her take on the situation, etc.). It’s not unreasonable for you to want to go to sleep at a decent hour and for her to be considerate of the fact that you’re a light sleeper. On the other hand, you don’t get to decide when she goes to bed. She’s an adult, she shouldn’t have a mandatory bedtime. Though, again, she should be respectful of your decision to go to bed early.

You are NTA for wanting to sleep. YTA for trying to enforce a bedtime on her though."
9zjrf1,"NTA at all in my book. A person really has to look after themselves in those circumstances. I've done the same to my sister and it's allowed me to help give real support to those people in the family who are still working with her, because I can now let them vent without getting drawn in. I may well step back in the ring one day but no apologies for stepping out at all. "
9zjufu,You’re definitely not he asshole. I can’t believe she treats her kid like that. I wouldn’t want to be with this woman 
9zjvso,"YTA. As a mod, you should be enforcing rules the streamer would want in place. It isn't your place to decide who should or shouldn't be in the chat or what the vibe should be, and if the streamer doesn't mind people in the chat talking about depression or even wants/welcomes them there, you shouldn't be banning them. "
9zjxrs,"NTA, you are not obligated to pay for someone’s drinks. Sure, it’s a nice thing to do but you really don’t have to "
9zjzfm,"NTA, it may be hard to hear this but she doesn’t care about you, she should understand your problems, I would recommend cutting that toxic relationship "
9zk8dw,"NTA, going through a lot and you have your priorities (recovering and family). My sister's sucked the family into her vortex for years, at times completely unintentionally, at other times maliciously and still at other times through learnt helplessness. I decided to cut her out this year. If I had a family of my own to raise I'd probably have done it years ago. I do remember how hard it was for my ex, being close to the family she saw everything including the outright emotional puppeteering, and she hated my sister. And the idea that my ex was taking someone's crazy mental state personally made me really angry. Problem of being a partner in a situation like that is you have a different (sometimes clearer) perspective, but at the end of the day we can only tolerate criticism of family members by ourselves and other family members. Good luck with the leg!"
9zkw5r,"I’m gonna go mostly NTA on this one. You’re not an asshole in general nor was this necessarily an asshole move to make imo. Just seems like a situation where the consequences didn’t seem apparent until they happened. 

That being said, man oh fucking man, this post breaks my heart. Is there any way you can get her into a home or some sort of living facility? And also make sure you’re there for her, now more than ever. Do what you gotta do (as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone) to instill hope. I find that comedy can be a really good outlet in these kinda moments. There are plenty of videos online of people pranking/trolling these fake scams to get them pissed off that might help lighten the mood for her. From there, scrap up all of her savings and find real ways to invest it that she could get money back on. There’s definitely a subreddit or two for that. Best of luck!"
9zl3vk,"NTA.  

Also you really need to be more careful with your money. You shouldn't have just given her 1400 dollars, that's a lot of money. You need to take care of your future."
9zlat0,"NTA and screw her. Simply tell her you're done with family photos. If she tries to argue just ignore it, you don't need to be made to feel like shit for a worthless picture. "

9zlix6,"You’re not an asshole for thinking he might invite you. You’re probably not invited, and honestly you probably wouldn’t have a great time with him and his friends. You should plan your own trip or do your own thing that summer. The two of you are really young. You have so many options, this time in your life should be spent exploring yourself and not losing out on experiences over a long distance boyfriend who is going to spend an entire summer in Europe "
9zlks5,NTA It‘s a migrant thing. Have a similar problem with a distant branch of my family. Only because we live in a wealthy country doesn’t mean we are rich. The audacity to think that we owe them based on shared blood is astonishing. Just stay strong and don’t falter. Beggars will be beggars.

9zm3jn,"NTA. 

If this person is estranged from you, why would you want them around your kids? It is your choice whether or not you want to contact him or have him as a part of your life. If you do choose to reconnect with him, you should develop your own relationship with him first before you even consider getting the kids involved.

It's possible he's ""changed"" but it's just as possible that he hasn't. Imagine that your kids meet him and then you find out he's not changed and you cut of contact again. Do you really want to answer uncomfortable questions about ""What happened to Grandpa?"" "

9zmi92,Not the asshole. If you're old enough to live away from home for college you're old enough to stay out however late you want.
9zmpj6,Nope.  You need better friends though.
9zmvmt,"Wtf man?  NTA.  That’s a crazy person thing to say to *someone in a fucking hospital bed.*  Her sympathy is just that, sympathy - as in not pain, not suffering, just having to be supportive and not needy - and her trying to guilt you for feeling unwell is pretty fucked up.  Sounds like she needs to mature a *lot* before she can call herself an adult."

9zoug6,"NTA  Dude.  Your ""best friend"" is still lying to you.  That was a bullshit story he told to try and save his relationship.  But now that that's over, he's just hanging on to the lie because he doesn't want to be caught on that too.  

PS:  He told his girlfriend that lie to undercut you before you could tell her the truth, so that she'd already have his story to believe."
9zozv5,"Yta. Yea. I don't understand the mindset that stealing from a major corporation is any better than stealing from a mom and pop shop. Stealing is stealing, plain and simple. Just because it may not inflict tons of financial risk on the larger corporations doesn't mean it's okay. You broke it. You pay for it. Such is life. "
9zp12j,"I don’t think you are an asshole, but maybe talk to her about it. Reassure her that nothing is going on with him, and that you value both of their friendships. 
Good luck! Xx"
9zplka,"NAH, just a misunderstanding I think.  

As u/aurora-_ said, it's understandable on both sides. Part of giving a loved one a gift is seeing the reaction, and he may have misinterpreted your asking to open it later as you not caring about the gift. I can see it. I'd probably be hurt too if that's how I took it.  

Misunderstandings happen, I think you owe him an apology and he owes you the same for his reaction. Should be water under the bridge."

When you're off alone at school, do what you'd like. When you're with your family, who I would assume is sending you to the university, you can put your damn phone down for an hour and show them a little respect when they'd like to talk.

Your dad won't be there anymore at some point, and you're going to carry with you every time you shut down a conversation with him when you think of his memory, all because of some stupid youtube videos.

First of all I don’t really think her BPD plays heavily into this and I’m a little uncomfortable with how much you’ve tried to pin on it. You’ve known her for over 20 years, you’ve recently become close, you’re leaving now and she’s slightly distancing herself. Her forming an attachment to you after 20 years isn’t necessarily mentally ill behavior and her being upset you’re leaving isn’t either. It’s a normal reaction. 

I don’t think you’re the asshole for having negative feelings about that in general, but if it crosses the line into trying to tell her she isn’t entitled to be a little bummed or that she only feels like this because she has BPD, that’s where it becomes an asshole move. You’re entitled to feel however you want, sure. So is she. This is going to be hard to navigate, socially, all around. "

A couple of years ago, I told her and told her to tell the family not to buy me a bunch of cheap gimmicky crap that I’m not going to use and will only clutter up the house. 

That sounds like I’m the asshole big time, but I told them it’s a waste of money and I’d rather have nothing.

I am going to say ESH but I'm going to clarify. I think you're off the hook for pretty much everything in the email. You're right, it looks like an attack on you and was an asshole move. 

But unfortunately I do think you're kind of in the wrong for when B came back early on the weekend. Hearing someone and the comment 'oh shit she's in there' when you know your roommates exist and they have keys shouldn't make you go straight for the pepper spray and call the police. You may not have meant to, but by asking her to inform you when she's coming back to the room, you *are* being kind of unreasonable. Think about it--your roommate, who you know, arriving at an unexpected time was enough to send you running for the pepper spray. And you think B is being unreasonable when she doesn't like you having your guests (who she doesn't know) over without notifying her? It's pretty hypocritical of you.

That said, overall I think the email really sucked. It seems like they're making up shit. But I do think you were the asshole in that one situation and I hope I explained why I thought so. "
9zvyet,"On its face? NTA. I was in a semi-secret LDR with my current boyfriend, because his parents didn’t approve. We’re openly together now that we are committed. I do not regret holding back telling people, as I wanted to be sure it was a secure relationship.

Almost all of my friends cut ties with me because of the same thing you're talking about. I wasn't willing to help myself, and they didn't want to hear it anymore. I understand and I don't blame them. The problem is that when I was finally ready to break up with this guy, I had no support system. I no longer had any friends and it was that much harder to leave him and took many more months than it otherwise could have.

I feel like from your post she too was unsure about whether she should say something, but god forbid something happen and she didn’t and everyones mad at her because she should have let your immediate family know so they could help.

And well meaning family getting “just being concerned” can and does make it worse. They beat themselves up over it, feel bad, and fall into the cycle. Only approach if she starts the conversation, otherwise? You won’t be helping. 

Edit: It’s worth noting that OP has no idea how much she actually weighs. He just speculates, and says she eats “everything” and drinks soda. There’s no solid actual information, just him calling her fat. Also, judging by OP’s post history, he’s concern trolling. He’s open about drinking at 19, and using weed more than once. But being fat is the problem? 

(Note for people not wanting to hunt: yes he is American. He is implying in his post he is doing weed illegally and not safely, but I will acknowledge I could be taking too much from it. - Original point stands. He wants to “die young” per a post, but his sister being fat is a problem.

My wife asked a couple of times actually. I asked her if I were to get remarried, if she would like to have a joint Christmas at my new wife's parents house. She quickly declined. lol!!

I bring all that up to say that your parents should have cut the ties out of respect for you after you and your ex got divorced. I'm sure they are doing it so they can see their grandson on a more regular basis, but still. It's way too damn awkward and weird, and the end result is the situation you are in now.

I think the word you're looking for is infantilization. 

From your description, it sounds like she's doing these things as a cure for her own anxiety. That's not healthy for either of you. Talk to your therapist about ways to force her to re-program her coping mechanism (which right now is you). One thing I'd suggest is putting her texts and phone calls on silent. At the end of the day, when you've finished your responsibilities, take a few minutes to read through the texts and/or listen to the voicemails. Send her ONE text back that contains any information she may have requested (and isn't infantilizing). That way, you still have communication with her but it's on your terms. Meanwhile, she has to learn another way to cure her anxiety--without your involvement. 

After a few weeks, cut it back to every other day. And so on, until you have the communication where you want it, whether that be once a week or once a month.  Eventually, you will both enjoy your communications much more. Then decide if you still need/want to cut her out of your life. "

a08dp8,"I'm just gonna come out and say this. Everyone here is saying NTA because your a woman essentially. Every time something like this is posted and it's a man rejecting a woman because they have had a high number of parters everyone screams ""YTA, your literally slut shaming, huge asshole"". "
a08e0d,"NTA, you are old enough that your parents could've consulted with you and your schedule.  Would've made more sense between semesters."
a08ipy,NTA accidents happen and sometimes when they do parents lash out. They probably knew deep down it wasn't your fault but were running on impulsive emotion over their daughter being hurt. Doesn't excuse there behave though just trying to give an explanation. Your cousin wasn't helping by adding fuel to the fire but I'd say you can have a clear conscious. 
a08knx,You're NTA. Your sister is a lying drama queen and should be ignored. 
a08n9x,"NTA - Your boss's behavior was uncalled for. You gave her a notice she didn't listen, and she fired an employee over text. All completely ridiculous.  
  
Not sure how others feel, but in my opinion the company/boss will always take advantage of employees given the chance. So the employee can almost never be the asshole in work related problems."
a0963p,"NTA. I get where you’re coming from. Just don’t do anything about it or you’ll become the asshole. 

In my school we picked a gay couple as our Prom Kings and it was fine. They were great kids and we really had no better options.

I do find this scenario weird, if only because a couple is usually wins not separate individuals. Also, the student body didn’t vote? Organizers did? "

I have a very close and tactile relationship with my friends that includes hugging and cuddling, and I like to cultivate those friendships by sometimes meeting up with friends one-on-one. 

I'm not going to say you're an asshole, but I don't really blame your gf for being uncomfortable. I wouldn't care if my boyfriend had friends who are women. I wouldn't have a problem with him meeting a woman alone for coffee or lunch. However, I would absolutely have a problem with my boyfriend meeting up with other women, one-on-one, to cuddle. "
a09c9g,"YTA if you expect to continue having game nights at their home. Not the asshole if you choose to host it yourself, or elsewhere, and ask them not to bring their baby. But to expect to have these game nights in their home, where their baby lives, and make an issue of their baby...yeah, that seems like you're the asshole. "
a09mzh,"NTA- if you act like a bitch, don’t be surprised when you get called a bitch"
a09v2j,"YTA - you said you'd do it, and even when you started to feel like you couldn't, you STILL said you'd do it. Doesn't sound like any of your deadlines suddenly changed, they're just closer because time has passed and you're feeling the pressure. At this point it sounds like you're basically hanging him out to dry."

1) People who have autism tend to have trouble with social cues, so that's probably why she couldn't take the hint

2) Autism or any other mental disorder is no excuse for being rude to the people around her."
a0ay83,"YTA. You've been pretty dismissive of her this whole time.

She made it clear that she wants you and her time to just *be* you and her time. You keep prioritizing other things over your date. And if you want to keep doing that, fine, but then you should have broken it off once you realized that you weren't going to be able to give her the attention she wanted.

She was asking for one evening in many months that was just for her and you treated her like she really didn't matter at all--on your phone in front of her, always prioritizing other things over her. Jeez, one date in how many months since you've known her, and after earlier saying she could hang out at your place you tell her you'll just drop her off at hers on the way home? She *does* have to nag you to spend time with her. That's not fun for her. And then, after that, you only deign to spend time with her because you don't want her to keep annoying you--""I don't want to wake up to a hundred messages in the morning"". And then you tell her all this. You treat her like this annoying yappy dog. She clearly doesn't matter to you, so why are you stringing her along?

And after all that, when she tried to express herself and how you'd upset her, you told her to 'calm down and then we could speak', which is more or less 'I don't want to deal with the consequences of me being rude, so have those emotions away from me where I don't have to be troubled'. "
a0b0sw,"YTA here, most definitely. There's so many outside factors that could be contributing to her narcoleptic tendencies, and texting is a slow process.

You’re being annoying by leaving the lights on so he makes comments about it. That’s how it works "

I can’t even imagine how infuriatingly annoying it is to have someone tell you CONSTANTLY to save for their wedding, as if they’re the only person in the world that matters."
a0bidy,"NTA you worked hard so you can all enjoy something. They've shown you who they are and why they are not deserving of your generosity. 

Enjoy being alone and finding who you are. Meet yourself where you are. It's okay to be nervous. It's okay to be scared. 

Go volunteer and meet people. Invite them over to your house! Maybe you'll get a roommate down the road. Embrace your change and get away from the toxic people bringing you down. "
a0bnc7,"I worked a 12 hour shift yesterday, this is my only day off in a while and I think I should be allowed to enjoy it, it's not my fault he's done no cleaning for the past month despite me asking him to before I leave for work, and that's the thing, I've even tried to get him to do housework while I am at work, that way my days off can be his too, so we can actually do things together"
a0bqbv,"YTA! Wow. This poor kid is stressing himself out trying to please everyone and your reward for him trying to be a good parent and appease everyone is to disinvite him? Clearly his daughter is his priority, which is admirable considering you were his supposed role model. "
a0bzko,"No I don’t think you’re an asshole for that, I mean I don’t talk to my grandparents at all but if they were shitty like that and called incessantly I’d block them too, always remember family doesn’t mean you have to bend over backwards and ignore bad behavior because they’re related to you I’d completely ignore the guilt trip. I think sometimes when people go out in a painful or tragic way then they weren’t exactly the best person and didn’t take care of themselves enough. "
a0c0u8,NTA. Some people just need to be told they are assholes. It's a free public service.
a0ccrl,"100% NTA, you are under no obligation to forgive someone who was abusive you, talk to your mother about how he's made you feel and that a simple apology isn't going to fix the hurt he's caused and in all honesty a family holiday to me sound like a bad Idea as you'd have no safe place to retreat to if he started being horrible to you. "
a0cgen,NTA if you’ve informed each party of the others’ invitation. they can choose to attend or not if they can’t settle their differences. it seems like you’re just trying to be polite with your long term friends.
a0cmqw,NTA - lots of irrelevant information here but her refusing to introduce you to her parents because of your theoretical career not being up to their standards among other things would make her the asshole. You’ll get over it in time and find someone who treats you better.
a0cr02,"You are all pieces of work. You yourself sound like you have issues as well as KC and Kenny. It's a difficult situation with someone like him. I won't advise what not to do but one thing you could do is get restraining orders against him, for her and maybe even for you and for anyone he's threatened to kill. If he breaks those orders he gets put in jail. Also, if you do something illegal, even to try to make a situation better, you're putting yourself at risk of going to jail for a long time too, just be very aware of that."
a0crtf,"it's just spam.

Have you looked in to this?

I don't think you can just take your parent off your birth certificate. I believe your have to be adopted by your step mom. But your mother is still your BIRTH mother, hence why she's on your birth certificate. It's a historical record."
a0d6iq,"NTA.   Your mom is clearly incapable of providing care to the children she has.  Being over permissive is almost as bad as being abusive.  This is not something she wants to hear, but as long as she is taking care of children, she needs to put the health and welfare of *all* of them first, even if it means admitting that she's in over her head on one of them.

Also: paragraphs are your friends.  Try using them."
a0di9p,"NTA.  She's allowed to hold her beliefs as are you. What's wrong is her expecting you to go to church. She shouldn't be forcing her beliefs on you.

Have you tried talking to her logically and showing her your path?!? "
a0dnfr,YTA ..you could have squashed the drama and just had a nice time decorating as a family..regardless of if she was pissy about leaving to get a tree alone.

a0dv6d,Not all Americans want this. Yta for assuming everyone in the USA is the same.
a0dvvv,I would suggest getting him a cheap mouse during the holidays. You can get some for around $10.
a0dz1f,Fuck that guy. People that cheat on their spouses are the scum of the Earth.
a0e51w,"NTA but if you want to be 100% sure ask them what they think of those trackers. Maybe act like you’re thinking about getting one for yourself. They’ll either say that they’re cool or they think they’re stupid, use that to judge whether or not it’s a good idea to get it for them. "

Fair warning, you'll be the obvious suspect. Glitter isn't called theatrical herpes for nothing."
a0eg65,"Yeah, YTA. Sex workers are poor and the IRS doesn't really care about going after poor people who can't pay taxes.

Sex workers are also often mysteriously kicked out of banks because their money behavior looks like drug money laundering."

a0f9xp,Get her a Visa gift card. Nothing wrong with that. You can use that anywhere. Don't give her a check. 
a0fa57,YTA - talking on the phone for an extended period of time in an enclosed space is inconsiderate. Your fellow passengers have no chance to get away from whatever God awful and no  doubt boring conversation you were having. 
a0fed9,"NTA. You're entitled to protecting your own emotional well-being, and dealing with his all the time will burn you out. Of course, let him know he can tell you anything, but ultimately it would be ok for you to say ""I'm not sure, talk your therapist about it"". "
a0fyle,YTA for letting it get that far tbh then assuming him wanting to be more than friends means he just wants to bone you.

a0g6ut,NTA. That dude has some fuckin nerve crashing at your place when he kicked you out first. 
a0ga9o,"I'm afraid this goes well beyond the boundaries of AITA. 

It's apparent that your relationship with your parents is rocky at best (particularly with your father). I don't want to pry into why this is the case and what lead to the therapy but if professional counselling hasn't helped then it's looking like a lost cause.

As for your plan of action I'm going with NTA. I don't think anybody should be subject to that kind of abuse and manipulation, and it sounds like you have a constructive plan of how to deal with this going forward. "
a0gk4f,"NTA as it was very clearly a reference to the copypasta and a joke but tone over text is also very difficult to convey so her reaction wasn't completely unwarranted.

a0ik2l,Yeah that makes her TA. Was this the trigger that  are you call her fat? You can defend him without being personal in your attack. It makes your defence stronger.

a0j1is,"You should absolutely have at least one suit in your wardrobe. Just some black pants and a black jacket. A wedding, job interview, funeral, other fancy outing, there's many reasons to own a suit. It doesn't have to be Hugo Boss, you can find decent deals on them. 

So I'd say YTA just because you think owning a suit isn't necessary. 
NTA for specifically the wedding as there is no ""formal"" required dress code."
a0j6b1,"To your question, I'd say NTA. Though it was most definitely an asshole move, you did go up to them and apologized. Note here that I'm assuming this was a one-time thing, and not something that has been happening on a more regular note. As for what to do, hard to say. Everyone has different ways of dealing when they feel like shit (which I assume your friend does right now). You will probably know the answer as to what to do better than any random internet person."

a0juh5,"NTA. At the end of the day, yes they are family but you have to do what’s best for you. You’re an adult and you’ve got to ensure that you’re environment is not toxic, which based on the information you’ve given us appears to be just that. "

a0kten,"ESH. On one hand, drumming just isn’t the type of hobby that should be performed in an apartment. If you’re aware that you’re the “loud neighbor,” you should knock it off and be the respectful neighbor instead. 

On the other hand, loud noises do happen in apartment settings, and dealing with those noises is part of apartment life. 

In other words, if you want to play your drums without people complaining, you should buy a house. Drumming is loud and annoying, and it seems obvious that your neighbors don’t want to hear it. If he wants to not hear anyone playing drums, he should buy a house. You technically have the right to do what you’re doing. "
a0kxim,"NTA

This whole post is quite the **shitshow** (pun intended)

You ended this relationship because she got mad at you for *rightfully* not wanting an infected towel, not *just* because of the gastro incident (though that certainly didn't help her case).

a0n1mf,NAH it would be one thing if you took them out for dinner and they ignored you but based on your story you didn't tell them you wanted to hang out either PLUS when one roommate took you to their room (to what we can assume to do was hang out) you immediately left. 
a0n6id,"ESH. I imagine this will be polarizing, but I gotta say I really hate this new trend of going after people's livelihood because they're assholes. It doesn't help anything. It just further isolates people into their political bubbles. He's not going to see this as a just response to his behavior. He's going to see it as ""liberal bullying"" and feel like some kind of martyr for it. I get that a lot of people think isolating them is a good thing. I don't get *why* they think that though. It's not common for people to respond to feeling isolated by doing a complete 180 on their world views."
a0o0e4,"**NAH** due to your naivety. That being said, looking at it from your coworkers' perspective:

* You were well enough to be at school (you didn't get sent home sick), but not well enough to work? Seems like a weak excuse to get off.
* There wasn't a single opportunity for you to call in earlier? Or send a text, or an email? That seems unlikely, and again, makes it seem like you're trying to get off easy.
* This is only your second week of work, at your first job. If I were your boss, I would be questioning if I made the right decision in hiring you.

You need to make sure this doesn't happen again. Unless you're so sick (throwing up, etc) that you can't work, you need to show up for work. If you are too sick to work, but for some reason can't leave school, ask to go to the nurse's office and explain your situation to the nurse. This should give you the chance to call your boss before it's too late.

You're NTA, but you definitely need to change your work habits or you're going to get fired."
a0o1n9,"NTA

1) I think your request that he pitch in around the house in lieu of rent is perfectly reasonable and more than fair. But even if I didn't, frankly, it's your house. You decide who lives in it and what they're expected to do/pay in order to continue living in it. ""(I) shouldn’t have to pay for a house (I have) no equity in,"" is possibly the stupidest argument I've ever seen.

2) You are correct that his current poor decisions affect you. He can't live completely off of your generosity and expect you to sit idly by while he throws away what wealth he has."

First principle of sex is “do no harm”. If you know that your behavior is going to hurt the girl over the long term you shouldn’t do it. "
a0ozj8,"NTA, but this is a grey area, and I have mixed feelings about this topic in general. You aren’t obligated to take care of your parents and in-laws and they shouldn’t be demanding it.

I’m aiming to fund my own retirement and will place no expectations on my children to “return the favour”. They will have their own family to provide for.

My parents don’t feel entitled either. They are immigrants and worked hard to provide the best opportunities for their children, made us their priority, and didn’t really invest and plan for their own retirement very well. So I feel like I owe them something.

My in-laws are selfish, narcissistic, entitled, toxic people who treat their kids like servants. I’ve made it clear to my husband that we absolutely will not take them in.

In summary, it’s complicated. The decision is different for everyone. Try not to overthink it now and discuss with your SO when the time comes."
a0p9t6,"NAH. You're allowed to be tired and express that. But also allow your wife the grace to be able to express what she's feeling, even if it may come across harshly. Hormones wreak havoc on a woman's body and mind when she's pregnant. "

>Also, I told her that even If I decide to donate half of my salary, she should support my decision as long as I'm covering both of us.

""You get no say in the budget because I make all the money"" is a pretty shitty thing to say to your partner who is supposed to be your equal.

One suggestion I've seen when there is a large income gap is that you each get the same amount of money to do whatever you want with. Save, buy a car, home theater, whatever. Might be something to think about.

Edit: Good God, did someone cross post this to one of the incel subs?"
a0q5mg,"NTA - charity is not obligatory and I really hope you don't bend to this guy's will. He's being the asshole, and if you bend, even though it's for a good cause, you're confirming to him that his asshole behavior works. "

a0qmja,"NAH-she’s a phone person, people like you and me are not. I get anxious and bored on FaceTime/talking on the phone."

a0r1bk,"Nta, but maybe she was a diabetic. So maybe she’s not an asshole either. I mean, personally I wouldn’t go up to a stranger and ask them to buy me food, but maybe if she could feel her blood sugar dropping and she got desperate? I don’t know. But either way you’re nta. "
a0r40a,"Yta. If you're telling them you'll do it, and can't be bothered doing it, but telling them it's good, you're an arsehole. If you don't have time, tell them. Don't let them pin their hopes on it, or rely on you. You are under no obligation to do it in the first place, but you say you'll do it? Then damm, dude, either do it, or tell them you didn't."

You probably shouldn't have cut across his yard, since it's not public property.  You can walk a few extra steps to get to the stop.  Still you had absolutely no reason to think this would be a problem given that everyone hangs out on his yard every morning as it is.

On the other hand, this poor guy.  It's not his fault that the school picked a terrible place to put a bus stop.  Having his front yard be invaded on a daily basis by a dozen random kids he doesn't know and can't do anything about has got to be really annoying.  I imagine you wouldn't like a bunch of strangers hanging out in your front yard either.  He snapped at you, but I wouldn't take it personally. It's just a shitty situation for him.

The best thing to do is try to be respectful of his space.  The outer edge of the yard is usually good to go, but stay away from the interior.  That's not yours and he clearly doesn't want strangers on it."
a0si3e,YTA - stop texting her. You literally have no reason to and you are just looking for trouble  
a0t4jo,"NTA - people who are always late suck. It's not like she even has kids, which are a legitimate excuse. She's just lazy and has no respect for your time. 

No problems calling her out on her rubbish. "
a0t8qm,ESH and pregnancy tests are a kinda weird thing to be buying on the regular if you’re not actively trying to conceive a baby btw.
a0teja,NTA but you should try to recognise these patterns earlier and explore why it is that you’re attracted to/attracting these people and conversations.
a0tg99,"ESH. Skinny is almost always a compliment, fat is almost always an insult. You may as well ask ""Why is it okay to call someone attractive but it's not okay to call someone ugly?"" They're not the same thing, and the only people who like to pretend they are tend to be bullies who want an excuse to go on disrespecting other people while scoring pity points on a technicality."
a0tu49,"God no, NTA. She, however, like most Trump supporters, is. If she doesn't want people expressing their political opinions in response to hers, she shouldn't post them."
a0tx76,"NTA and don't let the rest of the family manipulate you. The fact that they expect you to forgive her without condition but at the same time tell you not to expect any help shows how toxic they are. For your own sake, cut them out of your life.

a0v29a,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

Some context: I'm sick, toddler is sick, we just got back from visiting family on the other side if the country where we spent 12 hours traveling to get home. That was sunday and we didn't get home until super late. 

Monday sucked. The baby won't nap, she's pissed, I'm exhausted. My mom starts sending me over half a dozen pictures of things while she's at a store asking what to get the kid for Christmas. I'm in the middle of cooking dinner and getting the kid ready for bed. I tell her to wait. She keeps sending me pictures telling me ""help"". She wants a decision on what she should buy. I come back after the baby is screaming in her crib and tell my mom ""I'm having a fucked up night and I need a breather. I can't help you right now."" 

Then she starts guilt tripping me about how I ignored her texts and how she always responds to me and how if I communicated better she wouldn't have to ask.

To which I shoot back that everyone is sick, the kid won't sleep, she's screaming, I'm exhausted, and I DID communicate that she should buy whatever she wants, just don't buy anything huge and that I told her I liked the Fisher Price pirate ship and that I don't like character clothes.

She continued acting like a victim and saying I'm mean. She continued up until 5am. My kid didn't sleep the entire night. 

She has a tendency to do really nice things but it's on her terms and is sometimes really inconvenient and if you do what I did and don't show you're undying appreciation she gets offended.

a0ve8e,"NTA. While calling out with short notice isn't ideal, you cant care for children while you're sick. And your boss shouldnt want you on the premises while you're a significant fall risk (my mom was a kindergarten teacher and she fell and broke her wrist at school - their insurance covers everything, if they're properly insured, but its still something they would absolutely want to avoid).  

I will say, what your boss does day to day isn't relevant and don't stoop to that kind of argument if you need to have this out with her. You're right; you don't need to justify it or put it into context. It will change the focus of the discussion and that's going to muddy the water and potentially bite you in the ass. 

You can't care for kids when you're so dizzy that youre vomiting. You also can't schedule illness for convenience. It sucks that it was at a really bad time, but it is what it is. End of discussion, she is being unreasonable. "

a0yp28,"**EDIT: NTA because you only took administrative action after Bob was spamming.**. As a moderator of this sub, being a moderator does mean I have to behave myself and set an example in following the rules. If I'm enforcing them, I'm expected to follow them accordingly. 

However, that doesn't mean I cannot be a normal and opinionated member of this subreddit. I'm a person too, and I started using this sub because of its culture. Being a moderator here doesn't take away from that. And likewise, being a discord server owner doesn't take away from your capability to react however you want to. 

Power abuse would literally mean that you're using your powers (i.e. administrative capabilities) against users who have not broken rules. For example, if you were banning or muting Bob or Joe because they said something you disagree with but aren't against the rules, then it would be power abuse. It doesn't seem like you're doing that. 

I do that too, I pick sides. I mean, this subreddit is all about sides, asshole versus not asshole. And sometimes, I get into a light argument with people here. Sometimes the community agrees with me and people upvote my posts. Other times, the community disagree with my opinions and I get mass downvoted. Doesn't matter. I don't ban people or remove their comments unless they legitimately broke a rule. Even if the argument gets heated and they call me an asshole, that doesn't allow me to react with moderator powers like an asshole. 

As long as you're being fair with your powers, you are not an asshole. "

It might take someone from your home country to weigh in on just how ridiculous this is, though.

a1757c,"NTA.

I suspect lots of folks are going to imply you should grow up already and move out or something. Not a bad idea, but I think that completely ignores your question. 

Your father said he would do a thing, and did not. That is worthy of thinking he is an asshole over. This is maybe a good (?) lesson to rely on yourself, but you not having known that doesn't absolve him.

Between the broken promises, what appears to be poor financial decisions, manipulation, and questionable caretaking, your father sounds as though he ranges anywhere from incredibly immature to borderline abusive. 

I don't think you're an asshole for ignoring him, if it prevents you from interacting with him in a way that you know will escalate. If he noticed and gives you grief over it, it might not be a bad idea and play nice to keep him happy. Either way though, you should start focusing on your escape plan so you can leave him in the dust. "

My biggest pet peeve is the work mentality of working when sick, working through lunch, skipping breaks, working yourself to death, can't take vacations, and so on. For what? A carrot on a stick and a slap on the ass on your way out when your company no longer has a use for you.

Take your breaks, they're yours."
a19e89,"YTA

Let me get this straight... You're leaving your girlfriend stranded at the airport so you can watch a football game? Is this really what you want to start a fight with your girlfriend over?"
a19gvh,"YTA, even though you think you're just implementing corporate policy. That policy is a *hugely insensitive asshole* to people's needs and family life. Being in the hospital sucks, and depending on where you are, there's either a small amount or a lot that a relative can do for the person in it. That goes from entertainment to helping nurses and orderlies in duties to the patient, which in some places can even be expected.

Your reasoning is also faulty. You claim that this employee shouldn't need to take off full days of work so his wife can be away ""24/7,"" but it doesn't sound like you're giving him *any* time off. So essentially you're saying ""she doesn't need to be there round the clock"" justifies her not being there *at all* when he's working. Why not seek some kind of compromise? Be a human."
a19kzq,"NTA.

a19mkb,"NTA, it's okay to believe Jen based on the information you have. It sounds like you have good reason to believe her and not want to be around this guy.

a1a0vf,"NTA - But all signs to me point to the fact that the gf is trustworthy. This is all info that she VOLUNTEERED to you.   


You're long distance and she doesn't have to say a thing about it. But she did! And that is a good thing. Communication is key, and especially so in long distance relationships.   


However, she should not have cuddled with the friend. Staying over and crashing on the couch is fine, but this friend is acting devious. I would consider whether your gf should be spending time alone with him.   


It no longer feels appropriate.   


Your gf did the right thing by being honest and open, but your reaction is natural and understandable, and she shouldn't be calling you out for it.   


Good luck, this is going to be a tough one moving forward.

a1alru,"I'd say YTA for cutting her off and not telling her why, but other than that no. It goes against your faith which is understandable why you wouldn't want that as a part of your life, but is it really worth losing this friend? You don't have to date her, you don't have to allow her to be flirtacious with you while she's in a relationship, but I think you should still be her friend. She clearly values you as a very close friend, and those are hard to come by"
a1an48,"Not an asshole for wanting more sex, having no sex is a fair and common reason to end relationships. Sexual compatibility is arguably just as important (depending on the relationship) as emotional compatibility. 

However. Overall, I'm giving you a YTA. You are not asking her to explore *her* sexual desires. You are asking her to do things in a sideways manipulative way in hopes that she will fulfill *your* sexual desires. This isn't about her masturbating and enjoying it, this isn't about her awakening some kind of hidden sexual desire deep down. 

No, you're just simply trying to get her to be a more sexually active person. Which, at least right now, she's not. 

So stop pretending that it's some kind of innocent desire to get her to explore herself. It's about you. Now, that's okay. It's okay to have been ""I want sex, and not having any is a dealbreaker."" But you're not doing that. It's time to do that. "
a1ap13,"Jesus christ yes you are an asshole YTA. 

The disability part doesn't matter. You're part of a choir and she's part of the same choir despite her lack of singing capabilities. If she sucks, that means the choir sucks. If you hate the fact that she's in the choir, go join a different one. Everyone else accepted her as a member of the choir despite her singing skills, and you should too. 

This shit isn't about you, it's about the entire team. And sure, she may be ruining the sound in terms of musical skill and capability, but fuck she's trying just as hard as you are, probably harder, and you're sitting here like a snobby /r/gatekeeping guy saying that only the quality of music *you* accept would be good enough to produce.

My only “maybe you should consider” is if you were texting all day asking - I can see how she might have felt pressured, then surprised you wouldn’t answer her when she said she was thinking of coming at 8:30. I get it - you’re probably just excited to see your friend! But she may have felt that. 

If you value the friendship, I think a good sit down conversation about it would be in order. That you weren’t trying to hurt her but at the same time you were trying to entertain guests. That you will make it clearer next time about your strict 9:30 rule so she is armed with enough info to make her own decision about whether it’s “worth it” if you’re not answering. 

If you don’t, then let it go. She sounds kinda high maintenance. You say clearly you’ve got your own struggles happening, and it’s great to be there for friends when your cup is full, but when it’s not, you gotta take care of you. Her lack of understanding in that is sorta the pot calling the kettle black. "

Giving money is convenient, and for people over the age of 16, generally a pretty good gift."
a1e3k6,"ESH, but to be clear, she is the *much* bigger asshole here.

You aren't obligated to that particular computer, and if she wasn't willing to give it up (which she did make clear), your only realistic option was to wait. It sucks, yes, but you just have to be patient. Though I wouldn't go so far as to say you were harassing her, you probably should have just taken the hint and waited quietly.

That said, she was a grade A bitch. Insensitive, unempathetic, *and* she tries to publicly shame you for daring suggest she move two feet over? Fuck her."
a1e4b6,"YTA. I think it should be obvious to you that eating 3/4ths of the box before she even had a chance to eat them was definitely a dick move.

Buying a replacement box was a good idea, and honestly, if it was mutually understood that after 48 hours the box was fair game, then eating it afterwards was fine. However, she probably wasn't on the same page, since most people would expect a family-size box of crackers to last at *least* a week before vanishing. Hell, in my house they tend to last months.

Either way, dude, you gotta cut back on the Cheez-Its before your blood turns orange."
a1e6ky,"ESH - You say you trust her but then say she can't see a friend alone. You shouldn't be policing her friends like that. She's an adult and can take care of herself. If you truly trust her you would trust her to stop anything that guy might try to pull. Anything beyond that would be assault on his part. 

You are entitled to feel uneasy and uncomfortable about the idea. Your feelings are valid, it's what you do with those feelings that determine if YTA. You can even let her know that if she goes through with the trip you will end the relationship. YTA for making ultimatums like that though. 

Her friend is an AH too though. He sounds like he's using his thoughts about suicide as some kind of attention seeking. He might not be over her and may be manipulating her. Or he may actually need help, but he should be seeking therapy. Your GF is not his therapist and has no responsibility towards his mental health. The number of friends he has does not change this fact.

So here's what I suggest. You need to address why you feel the way you do. Apologize for *how you handled* this situation. Do not apologize for how you feel. Calmly talk to her about how you would be uncomfortable at the thought of the two them alone together. Don't make ultimatums but let her know you wouldn't be strong enough to handle that bump in the relationship. Talk to her about if there is a different way to help her friend and why she feels like she has to help him. Look for a compromise. Once you make a point, let her answer. Give her time to talk and *Listen*. Don't just answer over her, actually try to think about this from her point of view. If you get emotional take a minute to cool off. For some people writing things down as you go can help you detach the emotion somewhat and make it easier to discuss. 

This doesn't have to end with you being TA. Work together to find a solution. If you can't do that it might be time to reevaluate your relationship."

It's possible that it's a case of ESH, but it depends on how clearly the expectations were communicated to him.

You gave him no chance to succeed and sabotaged his grade. That's not cool."

She doesn’t really owe you more than paying through her lease. Shes giving you so much notice you have time to find plans, it’s not like the day you’re supposed to renew she’s bailing. I get why you’re upset but she’s welcome to take whatever path in life she chooses, even if you think it’s an awful idea.

Both the assholes for getting a cat and not planning on the outcome. Your only problem is that you have a year less time to figure out who really gets the cat. If you’re taking more of the responsibilities it’s probably legally considered your cat. "
a1esic,"NAH.

I dunno if you can be called an asshole purely by virtue of being spoilt. It sounds like your Mum knows you are independant and self sustaining, but doesn't hold your sister in the same regard due to past events and is putting in more effort for her as a result.

I can understand you being peeved about it, but at the end of the day, having things around you that you've earnt rather than getting them given to you makes for a far more satisfying life. Your sister will either learn from her past mistakes and build off what she's been given to become self sustaining like you (and therefore not be an a-hole), or keep sponging off others until everyone stops being willing to give her things (turn to the a-hole side). 

Only time will tell I suppose."

a1ezv0,"YTA, but there's a lot to unpack here, and some of your concern is valid.

On the one hand, to put it very bluntly, you are deciding for him that he is too stupid to not only be in a relationship but to even know *his own sexuality*. You understand what turns him on better than he does? Really?

How can you say in one breath that you aren't homophobic but you're bothered by him being gay? That's, um, that's what homophobia is. 

That said, I think it's totally fair to be skeeved out by the boyfriend, or be concerned that he may be taken advantage of in some way. He has Aspergers, a judgmental brother, *and* was recently homeless? I haven't a clue what all is going on in his life, but there may be cause for concern."

Like I said though, I'm biased. I would argue the same point.

I'd probably go further and say if you plan to declaw a cat or crop a dogs ears that you shouldn't be allowed to own animals at all. That shit is animal abuse.

That’d be uncomfortable for many *adult* siblings. Casting *young teenage siblings* as a couple is absolutely inappropriate. 


Frankly, even if both you and your sister were 100% comfy with it, it is STILL wrong for the director to cast you two as a romantic couple - your being cool with it is not the same as your peers being cool with it. 

Your peers are teenagers, and teenagers are nasty little shits to each other. The amount of nasty teenage assholery that you and/or your sister will face if you play a romantic couple is likely significant; being okay with the casting is not the same as being okay with that type of social stress.

- You can’t know how successfully you or your (very young) sister will be able to handle the teasing, insults, and rumors.

They're more open about things then you are so for them it's not 'way to personal.' Also, there isn't really anything personal about something that around 50% of the human race experiences. For people like them (and I), it's just a normal body thing, whatever. They're not assholes for talking about it when they don't know it makes you uncomfortable.

You're not the asshole for being uncomfortable. But you will be a **massive** asshole if you let this bottle up and explode on them over it. Just calmly tell them that it makes you uncomfortable (which is what you should have done the first time, so that they would have known to stop). If you hold onto any resentment or anger when you're the one who didn't say anything about it, you'll be an asshole.

They aren't mind readers."

a1w9op,"Hey, former Domino’s delivery driver here. You’re right that we basically live on the tips. Sometimes the tracker says a pizza is done before it is if the store is really backed up since it’s just an estimate on how long it should take (I think it’s automatically 15 minutes), but if the tracker said the driver was already on his way, that means he was already clocked out on the order. Now it’s possible that the boss clocked him out on it before it was done to help make his numbers look better to corporate, and then it would not be the driver’s fault. It’s also possible that he was taking multiple orders (I’ve taken up to five at once before) and the longest waiting order was a couple miles away or something so he went there first and then stopped at your place on the way back, in which case, he was just trying his best. He could also have been goofing off or something for a half hour before showing up. You don’t know, nor did you know, so I wouldn’t worry about it if I were you. You likely weren’t his only non-tip delivery of the night, and if you weren’t verbally rude to him, he’s already forgotten about it. But I think it’s also nice to see the other side of things. I personally think the tracker should be turned off during peak hours because it can be very misleading."

She contributed to the project (maybe not the same way as you and your other group mates), but that doesn’t mean that you need to shoot her down in the evaluation.

a202gr,"NTA for asking. Maybe re-approach it later when she's feeling less stressed. Speaking of which...

Just based on how you described it, this does not sound like a cheating situation. I'm wondering if she's stressed by the baby and maybe she has someone she uses for social support and she was talking to them about it. Maybe a support group, or another mom or a therapist or something? Maybe she's searching the web for ""why do I feel negatively towards my baby?"" or something and she's ashamed. Birth and young babies can be stressful and really mess with your mood. But you won't know unless you talk. I would sit down when the baby is napping and she's not totally stressed and ask her how she's doing, and then bring up the topic again to see if she's willing to talk some more about it. "

a20wb0,"NTA for considering it.  But seriously don't do it. For several reasons. 

First, your husband confided in you and has blatantly told you that this will cause trust issues in your marriage.  You need to look at your marriage as your first priority 

Second, not your circus my dear.  You're too tangentially related to the issue to have any real interest in the outcome.  You don't know these people. 

Third, your information is coming third hand and may not be accurate.  Before you step in someone's marriage and start stirring bullshit and flinging accusations, you had better seen it first hand. 

Forth, it's not your job.  This innocent woman isn't clueless. She's known about the emotional affair, so she's knows what to watch out for. Trust me, her husband's propensity to cheat is on the radar. Maybe she doesn't want to know the truth. 

Stay out of it.  This is not your drama and you need to not go on this crusade.  "

How can anyone seriously dislike a puppy anyway? Especially a lab?

It seems like a weird thing to kick up a fuss over, honestly, if she is happy about the general idea of a dog and liked the earlier options you showed her.

People aren't mind readers and sometimes they don't event take blatant hints.  You've got to lay all your cards out on the table to make them hear you.  "

a2j69o,"NTA- but with tax and tip your share was probably well over $20- let it go.  Next time if you are not drinking and everyone else is, ask for a separate bill."
a2j6nx,"NTA - he made a dangerous move and you said:

“Fuck you, man, I almost killed you - watch the fuck out dumbass.”

And then he continued doing dangerous and stupid things so you could run him over.

Dude has a death wish - that said, be careful, never know when one of these nut jobs have a gun."
a2jaqr,"YTA. Bisexual doesn't mean ""gay and covering it up"". It means being attracted to both *men and women*. "
a2jgcs,NTA. You were way nicer than you had to be. .
a2jsz5,NTA.   The barbershop is poorly managed.  They shouldn't have been arguing in front of customers.  They could have just stopped signing up new walk ins after a point.  
a2jt68,"NTA  
Protect your mental and physical well being.  Sounds to me like you'll be made to feel guilty if you go too.  If you're going to get shit on either way, my suggestion is to do what will most likely bring you some joy.  If they cared about you they wouldn't treat you like crap when you're there to spend time with them.  Stay home and be merry!"
a2jtvi,"ESH and YTA. 

She didn't ask you offered, then went back on your word."
a2k04r,"NTA but kids may not understand this and might view it differently, especially if in the past you've been very generous.  Maybe get them something small and inexpensive.  Gifts don't have to be expensive to be appreciated by the recipient.   "
a2k0yf,Don’t share your account anymore.
a2kb38,NTA. Clear and simple. If he broke it he should replace it or at least help you. He sounds like a fucking cunt. If he won't replace it then don't talk to him again. 
a2kbnz,NTA. You're doing your job; you need a break. HS is the asshole for not doing his job properly. 
a2kds7,"YTA. Not because you were making the joke, everyone makes jokes without realizing they're being hurtful. But when he said very clearly ""that hurts my feelings"" you didn't apologize and instead got defensive, which is not a good look. It's not a huge deal, but if I were your friend, things like that would chip away at my trust for you. "
a2kgax,"YTA. Not for not wanting to go to your boss’s party; you have valid reasons for that, as do your coworkers. You’re the asshole because you are holding your own party on the same night, instead of literally any other day, and for not talking to your boss about any of this beforehand. All you had to do was give him a courtesy heads up (“hey boss, I just wanted to let you know some of the coworkers and I were talking and we don’t feel like we fit into the crowd of people coming out tonight and the traveling is a bit more than we’re comfortable with. I appreciate the invitation, but we’re planning on doing something more local and quiet on a different night. Hope the party goes well.”) and do your BBQ some other night of the week. "
a2kjqi,"ESH 

You can feel how you feel but so can he. If he’s dating this girl he clearly likes her, and you asking him not to pursue someone you didn’t care enough about to keep dating when you moved away is kind of greedy. You may say you liked her, but you didn’t like her enough to make it serious despite some tougher circumstances. He goes to the same Uni as you and he’s making it work, so clearly he likes her more than you did. 

And besides, she’s not your property. She can choose to date who she wants you trying to limit that choice for her because he’s your cousin is kind of dickish. You said you don’t have feelings for her anymore. Cool. Move on. Don’t stop talking to family over something this trivial. It’s not like he’s bumping uglies with your ex-wife in the house you built her. "
a2kqov,"Jesus. Is he still breast fed?

NTA - his parents are. God help this kid when he gets a girl he’s serious about."
a2l8mh,"NTA.  As long as you didn't touch her inappropriately, you were just sitting on the couch with your arm on her shoulder.  But, she is 100% dangerous and you should totally avoid all contact with her from here on out or you might end up in a jail cell down the road.  Seriously.  Stay away from looney."
a2lfp7,NTA for thinking that way but I think it is talked about more because more people experience these things. Anxiety and depression are things that all people struggle with and can understand on some level. Fortunately most people have not struggled with something like bipolar or NPD. I'm a psych major and I wish more people were talking about other disorders in a positive light. Some may not be 'curable' but they are manageable and can get much MUCH better with treatment. I do hope this is the stepping stone to get there. 
a2lfvi,"NTA.

She should NOT have keys unless she is paying rent."

a2ltv2,"NAH, but this is pretty silly.  He didn't do it for the sake of controlling you guys, he just wanted to protect himself.  If you're going to monitor your usage of the word, why does the ban even matter?  If you don't like the chat filter, you can set up another server.  "
a2lwgh,"YTA. You did something you weren't supposed to do and then instead of owning up to it, you lied and deceived a friend.  You kept your deception up long enough for your friend to become interested in ""Grace"". You feel ""justified"" because of what exactly? Nothing you did was justified.  YTA."
a2lxqd,"YTA 

I mean, she didn't really do anything wrong and its college, i stay up that late too be it to do work or other stuff. If you really don't like the situation you should be living alone, but it seems like your roomate was also caring enough to try to help you and you probably put them through alot too. I feel for you, I have had and still have major anxiety and ptsd but thats not an excuse to be ""this way"" towards people"
a2m9en,NTA at all. They ditched you and flat-out lied about it. I'm a little pissed on your behalf.
a2ma50,"NTA.  It's not your obligation to give up your life to help her change yours.  You've given her all the advice you can and now you're just repeating yourself.  Some people are emotional back holes who will  suck the joy out of your life just to have someone share in their misery.  

Fixing her is above your play grade.  Tell her that you don't think that if what you've done so far is enough to help her then she'll have to seek help elsewhere.  Don't let her guilt you into giving up any more of your life for her.
"
a2mnvg,"NTA, you really didn’t do anything wrong. You made a sarcastic comment, he was physical and insulting.  His behavior was worthy of a red card. "
a2mnz6,"NTA.  You two might have been close at one time, but she's not acting like a friend at all right now."
a2mrd4,Definitely NTA. She's banging John btw...
a2mxxg,"YTA.  You certainly don't have to like anyone if you simply don't.  But you are coming across as being very judgemental here.  The fact that she did something sexual that you don't care for doesn't mean that her value as person has been erased.  For better or worse the cultural mores of our society are changing to the idea that her type of behavior isn't that big of a deal.  


You certainly don't have to hang around with them if you want, but you really seem overly harsh here to me.
"
a2ne68,"NTA, it's unreasonable to expect a close relationship out of nowhere, and to that ridiculous extreme isn't reasonable for anyone's parents, regardless of how close they are.

If your mother wants that she's going to have to work hard for it to make up for the fact she hasn't been in your life, and you have no right to accept what she wants.

I don't know, but it seems like your grandparents may have wanted her out of your life for a reason, and if she wants to be a part of your life now she's going to have to prove her worth. Calling someone 8 times a day isn't something you do when you're ashamed of previous behaviour or respect a person's autonomy. "
a2nnyi,"NAH. You were really young and physical attraction is super important for most people. You seem to be part of the majority, that in itself is nothing to feel bad about."
a2no63,"NTA you had no clue he was gone plus he didn't give you details
"
a2o04e,"Chat with your girl friend about it, not H.

You friend is inserting herself in a way that’s inappropriate - it’s not normal behavior and probably done to make herself center of attention in her friends bidding relationship. I’m hardly surprised that her interference also seems to provoke mean teasing between you two. I’m sure she’d love the drama of a break up or fight.

Explain to your girl she’s special to you and you’d like to make sure your time together isn’t muddied by that weird stuff. And talk to your friend and tell her to go get a life of her own (not really, but really)"
a2oh33,"YTA if you are keeping your feelings to yourself and allowing resentment to build up to the point that you need to vent on reddit.   
   
This is why couples need to learn how to communicate and discuss their feelings.   
Have you told her how you feel?"
a2oi5g,"NTA, but you will be in risk of sliding back into depression. My opinion is to take the job, but *do not* stop looking. That way you have a paycheck while you find your next paycheck, but also quit the first hint you think your depression is back. Take care of yourself."
a2ok35,"YTA. You even let her go that far, then got angry about it. If anything, you should've told her it was already uncomfortable for you as well"
a2ou8o,"NTA. You do NOT have to put up with a racist under any circumstances. And you do NOT have to enter or stay in a situation in which you are uncomfortable.  

Saying ""no offence"" or ""I am not trying to be racist"" doesn't make anything he says less racist, and I hope you can make that clear to your boyfriend, because he is obviously missing that point. If your boyfriend doesn't understand how much the roomie's comments hurt you, then maybe he's not the right person for you to be with. But that is up to you to decide."
a2ovwg,"NAH. Sex is an important part of most romantic relationships and it seems like you've given her time to warm up to it. I would talk to her about it, ask her if she has a reason for not wanting sex, like something traumatic or physical for example that could maybe be worked through. If not, and it's just a lack of sex drive, then you two aren't really compatible and you should try to break it off as friends. "
a2oyk6,NTA in my opinion. She doesn't tell you she is coming so you can clear your schedule and should understand that you are super busy with work and school. And the past time she has visited you she seemed super selfish. Imo she's more the asshole for not letting you plan to see her and getting upset you work and are tired. 
a2p34b,"INFO - Would really need to see how the convo had ended? Was it reasonable for them to expect you were still going to come? If so, YTA"

Ghosting someone is about comparable with misrepresenting yourself to get dates. "
a2q3iw,"YTA. welcome to being a frustrated teenager on the cusp of adulthood. Dad's still gotta try to parent. you may be tired of his shit but you likely aren't ready to face things solo.
"
a2q8wg,"NTA, I think if it were her stepping outside and hitting a few to feel good it would be fine. Just like anyone who smokes cigarettes but NOT inside and NOT near your baby.
This should be so obvious and clear. Idk what the issue is with her not smoking close to your baby. "
a2qdtt,"NTA, she just doesn't want to admit she's wrong and uses her age to defend her opinions. Her saying you argue to make her mad might be true though because you admit to taking pleasure in proving her wrong. I'd just avoid these types of discussions if it is hurting feelings and relationships but overall it seems she is being close minded"
a2qkee,"YTA. Even if you don't find it important, it's clearly important to your father. You can participate without being a believer just to support your dad. "
a2qu7j,"""Cheating"" doesn't necessarily mean ""having sex outside of the relationship"". 

Cheating is a breach of trust integral to the relationship, and while sex is usually how we think of cheating in most cases, it's potentially much more broad. 

It sounds like she obviously knew what she was doing was wrong, or at least something she knew you would be hurt by, and would be cheating IMO. 

NTA. "
a2r0wb,NTA. She should be trying to do more. The more she does. The better both of your lives are.
a2r4d2,"You’re saying not to live there, so pay for my first and last and a moving truck and I’ll be on my way. "
a2ra6q,"YTA. 

You offended her and she changed the subject to avoid further embarrasment. 

You probably didn't mean any harm but be more careful with your words. An apology is in order here. "
a2rf4f,"ESH because they're clearly exploiting you, but it's a dick move to just stand them up for petty revenge. 

But you should be the better man - just say no. If you do as you're saying and ditch them, they win - you'd be the asshole in the scenario. 

Stand your ground. Either they pay you the full amount, or they'll have no choice but to stay home with the kids. "
a2rg3j,"YTA for lying to her about how you'll go to visit her.  She's lonely and you just keep lying.  It may not be fun to sit around and watch TV, but it's far less fun to sit alone all the time and have your grandson lie through his teeth.  Go visit her.  Maybe you can play checkers or something."
a2rhnu,Eh. If you don’t feel it you don’t feel it. As long as you were polite when letting her down it’s fine. NTA.
a2rj0f,"NTA - parenting is highly individual and YMMV.
"
a2rj77,YTA For removing the post.
a2rpnp,YTA  I think this is a bit of a SHP . You have 2 bulbasaurs you're being a bit selfish in a GAME and not going her one. Additionally it is a dick move to rub it in someone's face when they're not doing as well as you.
a2rr79,"ESH. you dad sounds hard to root for. 

as for college, the only one who ultimately lacks for something because of it will be you. your family is certainly out the money if they are bankrolling you.

if you are taking out student loans you are literally wasting money.
"
a2rt4s,"NAH - similar story wife bought me a pink shirt and I'm colorblind. I wore it, got laughed at once by my coworkers. when I didn't get offended they asked how I could leave the house like that. I told the folks I work with I would have worn a tutu to work after kissing my wife goodby for the day and they all would have too if they were in my relationship. the pink sheirt has never been an issue since.

own it."
a2rziv,"NTA.


Your father must be held responsible for his actions. And he definitely does not show remorse for his behavior - he said he's sorry but talk is cheap.


You obviously care a lot about your dad and that's commendable, but don't blame yourself for your father's bad behavior. Try to help him as best you can but cover yourself. "
a2s982,[deleted]
a2s9fr,"YTA - you don't know her situation or what she's going through. Her supervisor is obviously aware of the situation, and that's all you really need to know. Mind your own business."

a2slzw,NTA tell him to get some ear plugs if he wants to sleep during the conventional waking hours in a shared space. 
a2sn2g,"NTA - people who play their shitty music really loud annoy me. I don't understand why some people need it up so loud. 

Keep knocking on your ceiling. If You come up with something else to annoy her I'd recommend doing that as well and alternating between the two. "
a2sy14,"ESH , the way I see it your SO doesn’t want anyone holding you back, he or she sucks at communicating and it’s got to the point where you are resentful about his constant criticism. On the other hand you are letting your parents slow down your career, a little drive and ambition is attractive. This could all be solved by an honest 30 minute conversation.  Your SO has the right to an opinion, the decision is ultimately yours. "
a2syvk,YTA and you're dumb. Keying their car is vandalism. Paying to get a car out of a tow lot is more of a hassel and more expsensive. Get better at revenge. 
a2tlir,"NTA, this is a perfectly natural way to feel about your bf hanging out with and getting close to someone who has already admitted that she wants something more than friendship from him. Anybody in your position would probably feel some jealousy."
a2tn0v,"NTA. Common decency requires a normal person to communicate with someone they live with. Your partner seems to have a problem with this making him the a**hole. Additionally, Your partner seems to default to blaming you when there’s a problem. This is not good and I’m just amazed that you’re not more upset.  "
a2txlx,"NAH. It's an invitation, not a summons; you're free to RSVP ""no."" Expect this to pretty much be the end of the friendship, but it sounds like that really won't be much of a loss at this point. "
a2txst,NTA. be wary of people who change radically because of relationship status. 
a2tydp,"YTA, but it's justified.

You had reason to believe that someone was feeding her information behind your back, and you investigated.

I hate to be the one that tells you this, but it sounds like you're the only one out of the two of you that feels the other is their ""best friend""."
a2ud01,"I was expecting you to be the arsehole when I read your intro but nope NTA, and I doubt you're the first person to swear at her either.

That's some pretty aggressive sales pitch, I cant imagine it works very often.  "
a2uje5,"NTA as long as you're upfront with the second woman that you're seeing someone else other than them. It doesn't sound like you've established an exclusive relationship with either of these women, but they should at least know what they're getting into."
a2uzgw,NTA. Please tell the truth to the police about what she told you. She's trying to use an out to salvage her relationship. False accusers are one of the worst.
a2v3sd,"NTA

WiFi is a privilege, not a right."
a2v5e7,"NAH

Personally when I was younger porn felt like cheating. I felt self conscious, as if my body parts were being compared to these porn stars, that I would become unattractive or that I would no longer satisfy.

The older I got the less I cared. Everyone is allowed their opinions of porn, if it should be infrequent, abstained from, or just used as freely as possible. Porn is always going to be a ""controversial"" topic in some relationships.

While I'm okay with my partner watching porn, and he is okay with me watching porn, we have a ""dont ask dont tell"" unspoken policy about what and when we are watching, because those feelings of inadequacy and infidelity can crop up and cause, in my opinion, unnecessary strain on a relationship. 

Good luck!"

a2w3tt,"NTA. 21+ wedding is understandable, especially if there’s alcohol. On top of that, it’s their wedding. They don’t need to invite anyone they don’t want."
a2w7ov,NAH - They're in their right to send videos to each other and they're also in their right to refuse because it's a group chat. Can't you ignore the group chat instead of requiring everyone else to abide by your rules?
a2wgw0,"YTA - Here is why. You just left and didn't even talk about why you would not do that. If she has a child with disabilities that probably stung a bit on her end. 

You're not required to work, especially in a situation you are uncomfortable with. But, just walking out. Yeah, that's an asshole move. "
a2wm45,NTA - Someone should have sent you a text message or a phone call and not relying on Facebook (which you might not have been able to see if you were logged on anyway).
a2wpdv,NTA - You live there and should have a say in who can come over in party. You should feel safe at your place. DO NOT have her pay you anymore because she could use that against you in some way. 
a2wuqu,"YTA   You and C are assholes.  First, it's really bad for a recovering addict to be around drugs, especially with his girl-friend doing them.  Also, obligatory don't do coke, you dope.  Honestly.  


As others have said, C is very definitely into you.  It's possible for a person to want to third-wheel as much as you describe, but is very unlikely.  Sorry.

&#x200B;

Also, again, don't do coke when your boyfriend was an addict!, (or ever, honestly,) and definitely don't do it behind his back with your ""friend"" who is definitely into you.  


Sorry, I know how that kind of situation sucks, but that's what's up.  You're worse than C is for doing this behind BFs back, even though C is pretty bad for giving you the coke.  Yikes."
a2x8be,"NTA she seems like a pretty self centered friend, no one likes hanging around people like that. You gave her plenty of warnings. I would of cut her off too."
a2xeo9,"NTA, but could've had more tact. However I understand your frustration, do you have an RA"
a2xf4l,"NTA, but he's right I've never heard of people rotating bunks and you just get what you get in college. It might suck, but theres really nothing you can do. No school policies force him to switch with you. "
a2xfk7,YTA for sexualizing your daughter and then blaming your husband for it
a2xgg6,"NTA. Your boyfriend in context probably a lil assholish to Sam. He probably thinks Sam is trying to get with you after that ""you deserve better"" line. Which honestly is pretty fair to see from his viewpoint. Your BF probably thinks Sam has ulterior motives. "
a2y3wz,"NTA. Just really important to remember everyone handles grief differently. It is important that you try to move on from your feelings because hate is an ugly feeling to hold in your heart and might rip you up inside even more if you let it sit in there. If, I were you I would try to keep my hate to myself and work through it with a councilor or someone not as connected to him as your sister. It's ok to express emotions, and your sister probably seemed like a good person to share it with but maybe she wasn't ready to hear it (you couldn't have known that she would not be supportive)."
a2y5ng,"YTA

You have got to use your words man.  You said you're generally reserved and shy, and don't do karoke.  She was probably just assuming that this was the case and that this wasn't something that you'd be comfortable doing.  I feel you, because I'm the same way and I'd probably be butthurt about it too.  But you have got to give her the benefit of the doubt and not be so passive aggressive and pouty about it.  When she said you didn't know the words and that she'd sing it with her friend, just say ""No, I know the words and I'm feeling all kinds of excited to do this so I'd like to do it.""  She can't read your mind and you've got to tell her what you want and expect ESPECIALLY when it deviates from your norm.  Stop fighting about this, there's plenty of beer and karoke to be had in the future.  "
a2y77v,Oh I know. My new place will be ready on the 16th. My deposits and first months rent are paid. Just have to wait for the other guy to move out. 
a2yifm,"Sad to say but your wife is a pushover. You need to sit down with her and have a very serious conversation about how you worry about her and that D needs to step up to her fucking plate. No mor whelp with essays, and no more commanding around the flat. 

NTA here what so ever. D is angry because you don’t give a crap about her demands and don’t fall in line to her attitude. "
a2yjdw,"NTA, you were prioritizing your education. The fact that you felt the need to go to class *instead* of being rewarded says alot about your dedication. "
a2yrcd,"NTA. 
Fuck them. Leave the group and don’t look back. It doesn’t mean they’re not your friends (the ones you care about anyway).

a2ytmb,In a legal sense NTA but in an asshole sense YTA for agreeing that she would only have to pay half then you changed your mind. Basically YTA
a2znw7,"YTA. You’d get a lawyer involved for $650, but not for someone destroying your property? Seems suspect to me. "

a30e09,"Our HOA made it clear it’s a joint responsibility between both homeowners. It’s built directly on the property line. It’s built to code, I had a friend who does fences for a living help me with it. It’s built on the same metal posts as the previous fence that I Ieft in my neighbors yard."
a30gr7,"NAH they got it wrong, go with them then afterwards tell them that you didn’t really have any interest at all but still enjoyed yourself. That would avoid any argument but still let them know you didn’t care for it"
a30qn2,I assume your friend is happy to pay for the clean up of HIS mess but not the clean up of the entire car. You’re expecting too much for him to pay the full $175. 
a30uvk,"YTA, because religion should not be an excuse to allow people to verbally assault others, especially in a professional work environment. "
a30v9v,"YTA for teaching this type of body-image focus.  It's obviously good to eat healthy and to teach nutrition, but if you keep telling her that unhealthy foods will make her fat, don't surprised when she has major body issues the rest of her life.   I agree with your MIL.  Teach her that too much sugar can be unhealthy and healthier choices are better - but leave out the part about making her fat FTLOG."
a31832,"YTA. There's no winning for women when it comes to this issue. You drink, dress however you want, hang out with men, and you get assaulted then you're criticized for not looking out for yourself. You take a lot of precautions and then you're a misandarist bitch who thinks men are all monsters. There is no right answer.

And one of the men that assaulted me is someone I had known for years and many other people in the friend group I was with had known him for decades. Don't kid yourself into think ""friends wouldn't do that to another friend."""
a31ghc,"NTA.   
You and your wife are a team and split the responsibilities however you see fit. If both of you are equally happy with this arrangement then don't worry about it.  

You do need to understand that when you leave your one job at the end of the day you are done with it.   
Your wife is doing many jobs 24 hours a day and never really gets to experience that temporary lack of responsibility or feeling of complete relaxation.   
Giving her a break from time to time would do you both good.  
Take the kids for a day once in a while and let Mom have some time alone to spend only on herself however she feels like spending it."
a31nya,"NTA, I would have appreciated that kind of constructive feedback when I was a college student. Being able to write a well-constructed professional e-mail is a skill. 

I might just extend the offer to help him--say ""I can tell that you're very passionate about making connections and building relationships in your field and I think that's great. Would you be interested in some feedback about networking strategies that helped me when I was starting out?""

He will, if he's not an idiot, say ""of course!"" Then you start with general statements about mannerisms and word choice and so forth, and then look to his e-mail for specific examples. ""People don't like to feel like they're the 1000th person you've talked to that day. For example, I noticed in your e-mail some of the wording sounded like you had written it in advance rather than tailored it to our meeting. I get that because it saves time, but people pick up on it and it can hurt your chances of getting a followup call."" 

Have alternative phrasings ready so that you are offering solutions. If you are positive and chill about it he won't take it personally. "
a31sju,"YTA. Sometimes we lose big, and that's just part of playing a game. Someone has to lose. You got up to ""play with the host's cat"" which sounds like you went off to sulk, basically. That kind of behavior isn't socially acceptable--of course they're going to brand you a sore loser. "

a3492s,"NTA.

I think some people will call you the asshole because you live at home at age 22. 

But to all those commenters - I am Asian and I understand exactly how much familial pressure there is not to move out. Asian/Indian parents are extremely controlling to the point of being a bit emotionally abusive in most situations. But we're also raised to love our parents so it's not exactly an easy thing to cut them off. The parents usually make a very large effort, it's just a completely different culture. So if you don't understand this please consider it. 

Anyways, kudos to you for standing up to gender roles and traditional roles. It'll be hard and it won't be met positively but it's the right thing to do. People like your parents (and mine as well) will not be the norm in 20-30 years. The old Asian/Indian patriarchal society is absolutely ridiculous and I'm glad to see it die with people like yourself. Keep it up.

However, you would be an asshole if you're making your mom suffer as well because, like you, she is probably being forced to do household chores. It can change for you, but it won't change for her. So it would mean a lot to her if you helped out. But do so without your father's demands... help out in other ways and keep your mom in the loop as well so she knows what you're doing.

a39r3x,"NTA. Your girlfriend’s insecurities are toxic. Telling your friends you love them is a normal and healthy thing to do. Friends are important in life and if your girlfriend doesn’t allow you to have them because she doesn’t trust you then your relationship is not and can never be healthy for you. Her mistrust started before you ever gave her a reason to be suspicious. Unless you have expressed romantic interest in a girl you’re hanging out with, your girlfriend should trust you enough to allow you to make friends and she should want you to be happy and fulfilled at school.

Imo you should have a serious conversation with your girlfriend about how this affects your wellbeing. And that conversation should end with you being able to have these friends in your life again whether that means you still have the girlfriend in your life or not. Controlling who a significant other is allowed to socialize with is an enormous red flag for abuse."

The officer also did not know the full situation, to the officer, it was just an argument that got heated. I can see their POV of how it wouldnt have been handled well if it was an argument. The fact that we was following you justifies the phone. I wouldn't hate on the cop for reacting on what was witnessed.

It's perfectly natural to resent your parents for something like that. I think it's a part of growing up - you perceive some shortage/fault within yourself and think, ""If only my parents had done this, or this, then I would be the perfect version of myself."" And then of course you say that when YOU have kids, things will be different.

Here's the thing though - your parents probably had these exact same thoughts themselves when they were teenagers. Maybe by moving, they were trying to correct perceived mistakes from their own childhood. Perhaps they wanted you to be more in tune with nature, more independent, or maybe they could just afford to give you a better life out in the country. Every generation within a family performs these corrections, and because life is balance, it creates a new generation of people who think, ""I'm going to do things differently."" If you'd been raised in the city, you would simply have another set of complaints against the way you were raised. I don't think this is a bad thing! I think it's just a part of life.

Your parents are only human, and they did the best they could. New parents can't see into the future and know how best to raise you - they just fumble along and hope they don't fuck you up too badly. So try to be kind to them, because it sounds like they DID try to be good parents, which is more than some can say.

Beyond that, any shortcomings you see within yourself - any reasons why you aren't your ""perfect version"" - can only be fixed by you. Take agency! You're not a victim of your upbringing, you're a powerful agent of change within your own life. You can do this!"

Women can (and have) gotten pregnant their very first time. How ‘fair’ is that? 

Are you sure that your need to have PIV sex outweighs her need to not get pregnant?

I think that you are also operating under the assumption that both of you being liberal means that she would get an abortion if she got pregnant - and that’s why you think it’s not a big deal. It’s pretty clear from her upbringing and her fear of getting pregnant that would not be the option she would choose.

You sound like just another edgey fuck head kid who doesn't take other people's feelings into consideration. The golden rule is know your audience. A classroom full of peers is not the time or place for this bullshit. "
a3kzyx,"I used to work with a pair of sisters as a support worker. One had aspergers, the other had autism. One was outgoing, chatty, in your face and extremely overconfident. The other was withdrawn, angry, moody and argumentative. 

It's easy to get annoyed with someone else who doesn't read your vibes but that is the limitations of some people with aspergers. Another person I worked with was obsessed with women, would make them feel uncomfortable (not on purposw nor in a sexual creepy way) but despite us telling him repeatedly that his behaviour wasn't suitable, he never took the feedback on board. 

I wouldn't say YTA - you're entitled to be annoyed at her invading your personal space and whatnot but with Aspergers there's difficulties in reading what a person without Aspergers can and believe me, I've been there. An old friend of mine had 2 children with a guy with Aspergers and he didn't come to see the babies for 2 weeks after the birth, didn't know their names, doesn't bother with them and sees them sporadically. But where we would be riddled with guilt or know our wrongdoing and perhaps be a little awkward or maybe grovelling if we want to make it right, he doesn't. He can't read that his behaviour is damaging his kids and texts as though nothing has happened despite not seeing his kids for 6 months.

So I guess all I'm trying to say is if you can't be tolerant, which no-one expects you to, then just reduce contact. But it's worth knowing that they have limitations to social situations and in an emotional sense that can be stressful to manage. I wouldn't put too much thought into your partner's families overcaring. They're used to wanting to protect her and are just used to her behaviour. You're not the asshole but you will come across as the asshole if you make it obvious you don't like her so it's just about finding a way to manage. 

Have you ever spent 1-on-1 time with her? The moodier sister I worked with, I ended up having a session with her on her own after months of working together and she was a completely different person and it was because her sisters over the top confidence and 'me me me' behaviour was forcing her to retreat because she wasn't getting any attention or care. After that session she totally changed around me and we had better times together.

Good luck it isn't easy x"

Anyone who tells you to mind your own business lacks morals and the ability to empathetically put themselves in the shoes of others. I'd also end this ""secret"" friendship.

4 seconds, for speeds between 55 and 75 mph, OR during rain, on wet pavement, or in heavy traffic

It's not an easy diagnosis to understand, so finding a specialist may be hard, but I really think it'll be worth it. Call around local foster care agencies to see if they'll hook you up with seasoned foster parents as a support, or they may have advice on the therapy front. Some agencies offer outpatient services as well. This isn't to say the therapist for son is seeing now doesn't know what he/she is doing, but like I said, a RAD diagnosis is tough!

Hang in there and keep checking on resources!

I've had several foster parents take these trainings and they have said they're both engaging and very useful & informative (which is saying a lot; training can get mind-numbing).

I think you think you are doing this for your mom's own good, and you probably have a good point that she's in danger of being thrown into depression because Scruffy is dying, and it's reasonable to question whether she'd want to be there.  But it's possible that keeping her away from Scruffy in his final moments could make it even worse.  

And in any case, whether she's there at the moment of his death is only one element in how she's going to cope with this.  Does she see a doctor for these depression issues?  See a therapist?  Does she have enough of a social support network?  Changing one of those things could be more important than this issue.  

And don't get your mom a puppy she's not ready for, when she might be depressed and said no.  If you must get a puppy, get it for yourself and take care of it yourself, and maybe visiting with the puppy might sometimes cheer your mom up.

If you've made it clear to him that you want to do certain small things, like going to a movie, and he can't even do that....I'm wondering why you're with this dude.

He did this to you last year too? So he knows you don't want to be alone on a holiday, but he's going to do the same thing he did last year and leave you alone.

He sounds really considerate. /s

And I get it, you live together and he should be allowed to spend time with his friends. You don't want to be the controlling girlfriend.

But god damn. When is he going to spend QUALITY time with you? Living together and being around each other doesn't exactly equate to quality time. Living together isnt' an excuse to stop doing shit and being ""with"" the other person. Not just staying in the same damn place.

Sounds like he treats you like more of a roommate than a girlfriend but I know there are more details to your relationship than this post allows."
a445qb,"NAH or YTA.

So you married this guy, which means the family comes as a package. Just like your family, only your family is different, and not nearly as social as the family you married into.

All she wants is for the lady who is married to her father to be there for her when she gives birth?

I'm a dude and I'm sitting here thinking, ""wow that sounds really nice of her to think of you so HIGHLY that she wants you there for that.""

And here you are bitching about it.

I dunno, I don't think you're necessarily an ""asshole"" for not wanting to be in the room while she's giving birth...

But the way you talk about her makes you sound like a fuckin' asshole."
a44b1e,"NTA. You did nothing wrong. Bringing your girlfriend with to make it less weird is perfectly accommodating. Answering all her nervous questions is good.

You could ignore the whole living-with-ex thing and still not be the asshole. The fact that's she doing that and is still all up in your shit? Totally wrong, and you're not at all wrong for bringing it up. You could've just *hammered* that point and not been the asshole.

Living with her ex is totally fucking weird. I'm not usually one to jump on the ""projection"" bandwagon but *damn...* Somethin' is fishy here..."
a44bai,"NTA for wanting a break from his incessant small talk, but you WBTA if you are unkind to him because you're iritated.

Dress warmer. You can always be warmer with clothing. If she is hot at work, I bet she's already wearing clothes that keep her be cooler while still looking professional. 

You can put on more clothing. She cannot take more off. ""Only pointing at me"" works for fans, which do not change the temperature. You're dumping heat into the room. Even if it's a sizable space, it being on effects the temp of the entire thing. 

Dress warmer, and maybe ask if you can turn it on in bursts after you've visibly made the effort to dress warmer. If shes reasonable she should agree. A sweater ""doesn't do the trick"" sounds like a shitty cop out. Long johns, leggings under your pants, two shirts, a sweater thats not decorative.

But if you do take them on and schedule their appointments, then you have a professional obligation to hold yourself to a certain standard of conduct. Doing side stuff like texting or getting distracted by random shit while working on a client is completely assholic and unprofessional behavior. I bet your client's ""low maintenance"" haircut doesn't bother you when they pay for it and leave you a tip. You don't get to take people's money for a service and then provide a subpar service with the excuse that ""they're a low priority client"".

a4kv9o,"NTA. Not at all. The way you help people like this is you don’t. That’s the only way they’re going to stop mooching off of others. 

My mother is what you described to a T. After my parents divorced, family members would take turns helping her out. If she was short on the house payment, she wouldn’t find a way to make up the difference. She would just say fuck it and go out to eat and get her nails done. 

She needed a new car and my grandmother tried to tell her no. My mother, my >40 year old, adult mother said, “she’s complaining about buying me a car, but she bought herself a $25,000 car.” Unfortunately my grandmother caved. My mom didn’t even go to her funeral. 

She eventually lost the house and moved in with my sister. That lasted for a couple of years and ended with my sister paying to move her into an apartment and my sister paying for said apartment monthly. 

My mom just recently moved to Florida on her own. She got a job and is fully supporting herself. Since doing so, her 20 year bout with depression is finally over. The family was unwittingly feeding her depression with their “help”.  

Anyway, that’s what you have to look forward to if you help your dad. He doesn’t sound like the type who just needs some short term temporary assistance.  He sounds like my mother. "

He didn't assume that though. He assumed that a specific person, who had showed interest in the opposite sex, was straight. The conclusion he reached was based off evidence, not a generalization. His use of ""straight"" may also have been simply that this person is attracted to the opposite sex, without closing off other possibilities. Take this situation into a more physical moment: say you both watched a man and woman in public kissing. Your friend says, for whatever reason, ""that guy kissing that woman is straight."" Would you see that as a moment to inform him that ""assuming everyone is straight can be harmful?"" No. It's ridiculous given the evidence, and unnecessary regardless.

My recommendation? Talk with your mum about it all, and how you feel about Harold, and that you'd prefer not having to babysit him.

Instead of saying ""He games fortnite on xbox, i play dankest dungeon etc"" just say you and his personality doesn't mix, and thus you feel stepped on whenever harold comes over.

You shouldn’t sacrifice your education just so your wife can get a dog, and to take a disagreement like this to the point of “I’m sleeping in the other room and withholding sex from you until you give me what I want” is quite frankly abusive.

Don’t relent to her, that only solidifies in her mind that this behavior is acceptable in getting what she wants. I would reevaluate what’s going on in your relationship, whether it’s worth salvaging, and think about counseling. The issue of the dog alone wouldn’t bring this up, but her extreme and abusive reaction to your “not now” would. "

Med school is extremely stressful and part of being in a relationship is being there for your partner when they’re going through something tough. Crying and venting can be a form of coping.

a4w1zg,"I'm inclined to say 50/50. 

You are completely in the right for calling her out on it. She is a teacher and she's neglecting her role to teach. 

That being said, it goes way above her as well. Lesson plans may be pre-made, or maybe administration stuck her on computer science duty when she actually had no experience in it. The way you called her out was unnecessarily aggressive to someone who may not be at fault here. 

I'm not saying she didn't deserve to get called out, but as you approach adulthood you will realizing that calling out negative performance in a negative way will result in negative feedback. It would have been better if you brought this up to her in a more positive way, and then if she did not respond, escalated it to administration, again in a more mature way. 

It's not your job to ask her to do her job. But then again, it might not be her job either. Even in private schools, some teachers get paid jack shit and have to deal with the administration just sticking their asses on subjects they don't deal with. She might be taking a back seat because she genuinely does not know how to code. Which is ridiculous. But she also wants to keep her job, so she's gotta deal with it.

I'm assuming all of this though, nothing to back it up. But you could've taken things a little lighter."

You never once mentioned that maybe you have hurt your boyfriend’s or friends’ feelings because of the initial bragging you made, just that YOU got hurt by the “must be nice to afford it” comment.

Seeing someone with depression who won't get help is frustrating as hell! It's hard and horrible for them but it's also hard and horrible for you too. 

You are not any kind of asshole for feeling this way. However, what you do about it is another story. Telling him straight up ""you need to stop throwing a pity party and get help"" is not going to help anyone. Either he's genuinely struggling and now feels abandoned by his friend, or he is milking it and isn't going to appreciate being called out.

First up, take some YOU time. Supporting someone like this can be tiring and upsetting. Fit your oxygen mask before helping others. Once you're feeling less frustrated by the situation, try to sit and talk with them about possible options. What do they think will help? So therapy isn't for them, okay what about a different kind of therapy? Therapy isn't always what people think it is. What about medication? Pacing? Colouring? Exercise? Don't let it be you throwing things at them, get them to find a solution that they can do. Tell them gently but firmly that if they need to try something if they want to get better.

Not saying you have done anything wrong ofc, just saying that this might put them off, and shift their thought process a bit, making them more susceptible for changing of behaviour.

Sorry for long post, just wanna help. Good luck! You are not the asshole. 
"
a51izq,"TOTALLY NTA - I am an animal fanatic, and what he's doing is straight up neglect. "
a51jzl,NTA. Good riddance to your entire alphabet of friends 
a51ogh,"NTA. You feel how you feel. You're not an asshole because you know it's a good job and are grateful, but if it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit. You have to make some tough decisions. There's going to be negatives on both sides. Put up with the job for the good stuff while being miserable, or create conflict with your BF and struggle a little more with less money.  It's your life and you have to decide how you want to live."
a51swq,"NTA

She's making her life your business by asking you to pay for her bills. That being said, telling her to give up her kid for adoption isn't going to help her situation. She obviously won't do that. Instead, stop bailing her out for her shitty decisions. And, start those conversations in public. She needs to hear how other people view her decisions.

&#x200B;

OP, To your deleted comment: You're not punishing everyone in the car, she is. She won't learn until she has to. The fact that she thinks she can have a third child without being able to support it is partly due to your behavior. "
a51ub1,NTA.  You protected yourself and the store owner from potential fines for selling tobacco that makes its way to children.
a51uxv,"NTA, you don't want to date someone who's not over their ex.  You're not looking for the same things.  It's actually really mature that you went no contact so you can move forward."
a51vtl,"NTA.  Even though he has a disability, he needs to respect that he was in a quiet area.  If he's unable to be quiet, he unfortunately can't be there.  On behalf of everyone who appreciates an actually quiet library area, thank you for asking him to relocate.  It sounds like you were polite about it."
a51yze,NTA.  Having a service dog doesn't entitle you to anything besides bringing a dog into places where pets aren't welcome.  I don't believe her dog is actually a service dog.
a51znr,NTA this “friend” sounds like a selfish prick and you Probably better off without them 
a5247m,"oh hell. my feels. I understand your position. there's only so much emotion that you can churn through in a given amount of time. Grief is exhausting and a natural reaction to things that trigger your grief is aversion. Steer your dad to counseling.maybe consider your own unrelated path of therapy.
"
a525wf,"NTA - you got approval from the management.
"
a5269x,YTA - don't undermine the parenting.
a526z9,"NTA - extended stay guests in shared living situations is a bullshit thing to do.
"
a528bx,"YTA - and this is fucking brilliant. I think I would be proud of you if you were my kid and counter-trolled me that hard.
"
a52coy,"Nta shes over reacting on things that are so far down your radar you don’t even think about it. Its not like you had your profile picture set to a picture of you too. 

Its a bit much to expect someone to perfectly completely wipe any trace of a past relationship "
a52hhj,"NTA. Even with not having OCD, the thought of toilet water makes me cringe. He was being really confrontational seemingly from the start, and then him purposely walking all over in toilet water shoes is beyond the pale. Hopefully you two can work it out, but I’d be willing to be you guys have more issues than just this to work out"
a52k4u,"NTA

Your dad is an abusive dick. r/raisedbynarcissists is calling. "
a52wlq,"NTA. It’s her choice to date you, and you aren’t actively choosing to cause conflict. It’s the parents’ issue, not yours. "
a539uu,"NTA Some of what you said here is either borderline or downright emotionally abusive behavior. Take care of yourself and protect yourself. 

The first step to protecting yourself is to learn about the types and signs of abusive and unhealthy behavior. "
a53bu8,"NAH. 

This sounds like a normal breakup. 

You didn’t antagonize him. Probably, you only wished him well. It’s not your fault. 

You guys are 15, so there will be drama (like people calling you an asshole — you’re not)."
a53c7v,"NTA. 

You responded appropriately. Someone hits you, you say WTF. (Normal, lol!)

Sometimes friendships end, and that’s okay."
a53wfz,"As far as I'm concerned, a nipple is a nipple.
But when it comes to being flashed, it can be a very shocking and disconcerting thing especially during formative years. 
Like, if she was swimming or whatever and she was shirtless and the kid saw, that's different to her flashing him. 
You're NTA for opposing, and imo she's TA for being so sexual around an underage person. "
a540cd,"NAH, You shouldn't have to be mean or whatever to sate your BF. But I can also understand how your BF could see it in a different light. "
a543xg,"NTA, you payed $1,500 for it and yeah I get that it would take awhile to make but thEY DONT NEED MORE THAN A YEAR. Plus they promised to have pictures Monday and then didn’t have them and won’t give a clear explanation."
a545ba,"NAH, you probably could’ve directly asked her why she was acting different because something could’ve been wrong, but at the same time she could’ve told you if something was wrong or explained herself. I don’t know, I feel like there’s definitely more going on than we know."
a545kg,"NTA. I've learned 99% of the time, favors end up biting you in the ass. "
a54bbh,"YTA. These are some serious consent issues and you know it. You need to be discussing this with her when both of you are sober, and you need to not be having sex with her when she’s drunk, especially since you apparently can’t tell when she’s drunk enough to be blacked out. This is not okay. 

Edit: you’re getting her drunk on purpose so you can have sex? You’re a huge asshole. "
a54okg,NTA.  Your girlfriend doesn't need to save her friend because she's repeatedly irresponsible.  She even turned down your kind offer to go get her.  Her friend is being a choosing beggar with who drives and using your girlfriend to clean up her messes.
a54w1g,"NTA.  On behalf of all people who dislike being around sweaty, smelly people, thank you for your service."
a550rd,"OP would have to tutor him in his home, not in a central tutoring place where there are other people.  Being 18 and alone with an unknown older man in his home can be a scary thing, even if it's for work."
a55aax,NAH. It sounds like his adrenaline was up and he wanted his hands free just in case. Not talking to him for days is immature and an extreme overreaction. 
a55c57,"NTA and also WCIYTA (who cares if you're the asshole?)

You don't ever take chances with the safety of your children.  *Ever*.  This man seems obsessed with your daughter even to me, and I don't even know him.  Some people just really love kids and pay a lot of attention to the ones they're related to.  I get that--I'm crazy about my little nephews.  But when he purposefully waited until you were gone to sneak over to the MIL's to see her, that ramps up the creep factor.  If he *appears* to have an inappropriate infatuation with your three year old, you cut him off at the knees.  Period.  If his interest is purely innocent (like hell it is) then perhaps he should do a little self-evaluation to understand why his actions and behavior are suspicious.  Who cares if you're the asshole?  This guy needs to learn appropriate behavior, and it's not your daughter's job to give him someone to practice on."
a55g39,[deleted]
a55w7e,"NTA, WITH CONDITIONAL

Aw geez, this is a tough situation, considering that this was a potential abuser as well, it makes sense to wish her no more suffering and to essentially free her daughter of the nightmare she is trapped in. I wouldn’t wish ill will or death on anyone, and I don’t know the family, but if it is how you say it is and the mother isn’t all that loving...

Just so long as you don’t wish death upon her because she was an asshole. That would be assholish if you."
a561d5,"They aren’t the assholes for not letting you live there and not offering another place to stay . 
But they are major assholes for giving you less than 2 weeks notice right before Christmas and than backing out of a previously offered agreement. 

Your not the asshole for being upset and feeling like you’ve been screwed over by them. 

Eviction laws should last you through early next year though. So you by law don’t have to leave yet. "
a565zc,"ESH. That whole ""there is still one thing you haven't done"" comes off as smug and bitchy. At the same time, she shouldn't have a fit over something like that. Having been in supervisory, managerial and even just same-level mentor positions, the best way to teach people is repetition until they pick it up, slowly helping them less and less. Most people will then make the jump to observation and initiative (though some take longer than others). What you did was to put her on the spot, embarrass her if there were others around, and make her feel like an idiot."
a56aj8,"Petty...but NTA. In terms of the original act, that’s just ignorant of her. There’s literally no danger in double checking the bus stop, she was just being stubborn. Regardless of your phrasing, her jumping straight to “sexist pig” indicates that her pride was hurt more than anything. 

She was wrong, you were right, so she dug to the only level she could hold on to her correctness: her gender. 

Which is just an incredibly cheap shot.

Next time though, don’t keep the goofing around like that going on all day. That’s not a great precedent to set. Have a 10 minute discussion, don’t act like an annoying child all day because she was a dick for 2 minutes."
a56fa8,Then Larry is also an idiot... haha
a56let,"NAH. You are thinking like an irrational asshole, but you haven’t actually acted like one yet. You are being a bit entitled but at the same time I can understand what you mean. There is no issue with a friend dating your sister, there is also not issue with you being a bit cautious. If you are upset about your friend coming over to visit your sister over you, then that’s a bit selfish. However, if you have never actively taken a hard stance against the relationship due to these irrational reasons, then you are not an asshole."
a56ybj,"YTA 

It's all fine and dandy for you guys to up and move all the time, but that kind of constant moving around can be rough on kids.  Especially in three years??  He's finally happy, has a girlfriend, has good grades, and you guys want to take that way from him again?  Not to rain on your parade, but it sounds like your new plan is almost identical to your old plan, which obviously didn't work out, and your son is going to see that as well.  

Finances can be rough and all, but you guys should seriously start looking at job options in the area.  At least until your son graduates from high school.  Other than making more money, it honestly doesn't sound like you've been considering him much at all these past three years.  I wouldn't be so sure your son is going to be as well off if you guys move again either, in terms of academics.  Switching high schools also means switching curriculum, which can either mean he's not going to be challenged enough or (worse) he'll have so much catching up to do he's going to fall behind. 

Also he's plenty old that I think he deserves to have some say in this conversation as well.  At the very least he should be able to voice his opinions."
a572q0,"NTA

You are not a slave.

> Like maybe a text an hour or 2 before she's at my doorstep dropping off the kids.

This is when you tell your SIL ""No"" and then if she still shows up with them, refuse to allow them in. Hell, unless you're expecting someone else to show up, don't even bother answering the door anymore."
a5752j,"NTA, your mom sounds like she’s acting really petty at the worst possible moment. Good on you for going through all that and at least trying to talk to your mom again."
a57kiz,"NTA
There’s no rule stating you have like your relatives. I’m sure many people, for whatever reasons, dislike extended family members. 

It sounds like your SiL is piece of work, but she might get a reality check once her parents are too old to mind the kids. 
Give the kid a break though; she’s only 11. It’s her parents who decide how she’s grown up anyway."
a584rx,[deleted]
a58cnn,"NAH.  Depression is a hell of a thing and I can sympathize with your girlfriend, but you're under no obligation to stay with her. "
a58e8v,"NTA, it's perfectly acceptable to stand up for yourself. However, your employer might not want you to mouth off to customers. I don't think it makes you an asshole, but it may make you unemployed if you do it enough."
a58j74,NTA. Fuck that guy 
a58r39,"NTA, but you need to have an up front convo with your girlfriend about how you feel. She sounds like someone who is comfortable oversharing (I do the same thing) and doesnt realize it makes you uncomfortable. If you never say anything about it  either in the moment or later, how will she know? "
a58rb1,"NTA, and I think ""Oh, we're so sorry we can't stay the whole time, but with the babies we're instituting some new traditions, just the nuclear family!"" is a perfectly good reason to open presents and GTFO.   


If anything, your husband's the asshole. Why is his mom being upset more important than you being upset? "
a5957d,"NTA, but recognize that mental illness isn't always out of control.  Your ex sucked, but other people are capable of coping and treating their mental illness correctly.  If you know you can't offer support to a partner going through depression, you can't, but I think you're being unnecessarily judgmental because of a past experience."
a59dsl,[deleted]
a59xs9,"YTA, lowkey. Yes, that mindset is homophobic, and yes, really wanting a son over a daughter is sexist, even subconsciously. Also, you aren’t entitled to any grandkids at all, biological or adopted. Your (future) children don’t owe you their reproduction."
a5a0vt,"NAH, I don't think anything wrong has happened here in either side it just sounds like things are just not clicking. If it isn't happening naturally at this point it just might not be meant to be. I would say move on and there should be no hard feeling either way, if you try to force a relationship here it sounds to me like it won't end up working anyway "
a5a36o,NTA. He is. My wife does most of the cooking but I'm an adult who can get my own food if need be. He needs to grow up.
a5afjv,"NTA, and so so many red flags about his behavior. Ditch this guy immediately before he turns physically violent.

But need some more info, too. One of the most important weeks in what season?"
a5al67,"NTA. They take your money, you hold the bear ransom!"
a5arv7,NTA but you should’ve texted/called her when you realized you’d have to leave just to be polite
a5b2y9,"NTA. As Phil Swift (Flex Seal guy) would say, ""That's alotta  damage!"""
a5b5kf,NTA. You were given the single room and you told John you preferred to stay there. I would say he is the asshole for attempting to move into the room they assigned you. 
a5b9n0,"NTA. Sounds like your ex-girlfriend needs some serious therapy. You cannot be expected to somehow know what anyone thinking if their actions/words are clear. 

You should not feel any guilt. You should also know most women do not behave in this way. Hope you find someone who treats you better. 

"
a5baqe,"NTA - sounds like shifty behaviour. ""None of your business"" is bullshit. Things regarding the kids they share might not be, but otherwise, it's your relationship so of course it's your business. If she needs time and space ""to grieve and deal with the divorce"" she isn't ready to date yet. "
a5bdql,YTA. Good intentions but it's not your choice. This kind of approach typically pushes people away. Teenagers in particular (taking an educated guess here) *really* don't like having someone mommy them. Acknowledging it's their choice but expressing your concerns politely is far more productive. 
a5be3e,"NAH - I hate my birthday too. I distinctly remember turning 8 and disliking it even then.  I am exactly the same as you, I do not enjoy the attention. 

I do feel guilty and bad on my birthday though because I know other people want me to enjoy it. 

Edit: I do compromise though and we will go out for a quiet dinner or have a takeaway as a treat. "
a5bgav,"NTA.

Was what you did rude? A little. But what they were doing was far more so. Tensions are high finals week. People got places to be. They should know better than to block doorways by college. And the lady said excuse me and they ignored her so yelling to move was clearly step 2 to me (well, step 2 during finals week.)"
a5bhhc,"YTA. Sympathy is a two-way street. You can hardly judge him for being ""a bit sensitive"" when you're crying because of your stress.

If he's not giving you the support you need, have a conversation about it. Let him know that you really need some emotional support right now. But don't discount his feelings because you don't think they're as valid as yours. That's just a dick move."
a5bkn2,NTA  You know you can cut off any branches that hang over onto your property right?
a5bkse,"ESH because your buddy is a cheating piece of shit and you made it clear that you weren't telling his wife out of any concern for her. You did it to get back at him, and telling his wife in the middle of a restaurant is not the best way to do this. If you actually gave a damn about her, you would've had a private conversation with her about this rather than airing her husband's dirty laundry in public. "
a5bq9s,"NTA because you don't owe anyone gifts, but I think you were rude to ask people to buy you something specific for your birthday.  You can get him a card and a six pack of beer or something to extend an olive branch.  You don't need to go all out, but it's not a bad idea to do a little something to keep the peace."
a5c9fp,"NTA

If him smoking weed turns you off, it turns you off and that is nothing that you should feel like an asshole for.  You shouldn’t have sex with someone if you are not going to enjoy it ( that’s the whole point, right??) 

"
a5cfrj,"NAH. Unfortunately, this is how social media is. I would say take a break from social media for a while, you probably won't miss anything."
a5cn0f,"NTA, if you can afford it, fuck it, get that shit delivered "
a5cpn6,"NTA, but you might want to just set a boundary rather than cut her off completely and see what happens.

If you phrase it as “I’m sorry, but 98% of people involved in MLMs make no money, and I can’t support those kinds of odds for someone I care for” it’ll probably go over better than the standard anti-MLM script.

As we get older, a lot of friends can fade away. I would maybe give this a little more time. She’s been sold on the idea that she can work from home and provide for her kids, and is trying to put in the work to do so. I can’t blame her, but I’d point out that shortcuts that seem too good to be true generally are."
a5cr7f,NTA - you have a good heart and you don’t mean to hurt her or ill intent. You’ve tried saying let’s text but now I think you should just tell her what’s on your mind. You’re an adult and you’ve got a lot going on and that’s just okay. 
a5d5os,"It seems like it would be better to have a frank conversation with her about kids instead of withdrawing and treating the topic like nuclear waste, you know?"
a5dhu2,"NTA unless you meant this in an asshole way and snapped. She’s probably just doing her best to make sure you’re okay, even if you don’t need it. Just tell her you appreciate it and you’ll tell her to touch it if she needs.  

INFO: is she familiar with the gym and lifts or is she new or a veteran in the gym? "
a5dsmk,"YTA.

Borderline SHP. Ruining people's lives because you are bored is one of the most asshole things you can do. Regardless of legality, you've literally created a shit storm.

Asshole hall of fame. "
a5dwrp,NTA. I'm genuinely surprised your vet friend is saying this.
a5e7g2,NTA. He needs to get a job and contribute. 
a5ea9b,"NAH

You describe you relationship as very healthy otherwise, which is good.

But sexually it’s making you “miserable,” because you’re incompatible. It’s up to you whether you stick it out, but these things rarely (if ever) change suddenly and with perfect results.

Good luck"
a5efmb,"NTA

You have a severe case of overprotective, narcissistic parents. First things first, you must know that the way they're treating you about dating and sexual relationships is completely ridiculous now that you are of age **and** because you take birth control (I also assume you wear condoms with your boyfriend, given the instance you have intercourse.). However, if the incidents described in the post happened before you coming of age, then the reactions they had have reason, but are still exaggerated and controlling. Underage sex is a serious thing, but, do not confuse stern talking and education with manipulation and psychological attacks (Example, being called ""a whore"").

You don't have to feel guilty about not wanting to deal with toxic behavior from your parents. If it's unhealthy for you, your boyfriend, and even your younger sibling, then you have all the right to stay away from it. Plus, if the description you're giving about your mother filing a *Protection From Abuse* statement be true, then you have all the right to fear for your safety if you were to visit them.

You aren't guilty or the asshole in this situation. You've had enough poisonous attitude from them. If anything, they're the assholes. Best of luck."
a5ekyx,"NTA

Real piece of work your sister is."
a5et30,"NTA. Block them and move on. This person is demanding and entitled and has, on several occasions, not taken ""No"" for an answer. 

They're missing you? So what. That's their problem to deal with. 

If they aren't prepared to take responsibility for their mental health or their actions, then they have to live with the consequences."
a5ey07,"YTA, not entirely your fault for thinking that she might not have been too insecure about it anymore, but being an asshole doesn't mean you meant to be. She can forgive you or not, but you really ought to explain that based on your last time talking about it, you thought it was okay to make a silly joke about and that you're sorry it had unintended consequences."
a5f0cw,"ESH/NTA

I think it's pretty clear why she's a dick, making plans and then breaking them to drink. But the way you talk about this, it's clear you get very upset and from what it sounds like, you haven't made an effort to talk to her from an understanding place. Alcohols or any people who are addicted, especially at that age, are gonna be a little delicate one way or another. 

> (texted her “I bet if I brought beer you’d come”) 

If you care about her, then find a way to talk to her that doesn't sound passive-aggressive."
a5f8jz,"The head house is the asshole in that case because they protect the kid, but they do nothing against him. If they really care about Iron they would put some supervision to ensure his well-being at some point. "
a5fhxd,"ESH except your wife, who’s at least making an effort. You should be the one acting as intermediary between your kids and the extended family. I’m not sure why you’ve let all of this fall on your wife’s shoulders, but she sounds like a saint for putting up with it. 

You should be the one to tell the in-laws that Christmas won’t work and then **you** try to coordinate another time. If that doesn’t work, then it is what it is. 

Hopefully people can be flexible so your kids can maintain some relationship with their mother’s family.  "
a5fth4,"ESH. For god's sake, you picked out an engagement ring with him. You're already engaged. What are you going to say, no?  Wanting a ""proposal"" at this point is just theater. Just put the damn thing on already. "
a5fv0z,NTA. Nothing gets resolved after midnight
a5g993,How could you possibly be the asshole in this situation? Clearly NTA
a5ge95,"NTA. I don’t think there is any law that says you HAVE to be responsible for him, so.......... yeah. You’re not his dad."
a5gqmt,"NTA. Even if (and that's a big if) you missed her telling you, that's not a reason to completely shut off like that. Honestly, she sounds like the asshole here. "
a5gv59,NTA - you gave her fair time to refund. 
a5hkje,"YTA it was not your place to interfere in their relationship simply because you're salty H has less time for you now and it is DEFINITELY not your place to say someone is or isn't trans
"
a5hyb0,"YTA, technically you didn't say you would punch someone, your friends probably meant you'd return fire with snow."
a5i7ny,"NAH.  He isn't an asshole for wanting his wife to come with him to his daughter's wedding, and you aren't an asshole for wanting to avoid a conflict that could overshadow the wedding itself.  My sister-in-law had this same dilemma, but she invited both new spouses and everyone was very civil and worked out just fine - they weren't singing kumbaya together or anything but it didn't cause any issues."
a5i891,"NTA. Fuck 'em. People need to learn that others aren't magically infallible saints just because you happen to share genetic material with them. Those bridges are just as flammable as any others in your life. So once again, fuck 'em, burn 'em, and don't look back. "
a5idj0,NTA for feeling abandoned. I think the lesson here is to not take the advice or seek the approval of the online community. We are just people who are supposed to be paying attention in class or (like me) working. I think you should look into a local support group for trans and other sexual identities. THEY are the real experts and can help you through this. Good luck and God bless. ♥️
a5iizl,ESH. You shouldn’t rely on your mom to find things that belong to you. That being said. A mother who calls her son deragotary terms is disgusting. 
a5ined,"YTA. She is being vulnerable and asking for you to help with something very personal, that she may feel a lot of shame about. You may be the only one she feels safe enough to ask. You could be in a very special position in her life. You should tread very carefully when you find yourself in such an honored and delicate position.

"
a5ir6z,"NTA

Keep that bridge burnt! Line it with C4!

Remember the good memories and move on! 

If things do not work, they do not work and ESPECIALLY if he is putting in no effort and is finding other girls! Time does not become a factor here he turned into a total douchebag and you made the right choice! I hope you find someone who treats you how you deserve to be treated! "
a5ixb0,"NTA your dad was disrespecting your mothers intelligence, you spoke up for her and now he is guilt shaming you for not letting him bully her. I cant imagine you being the asshole here."
a5j2x6,"NTA. If you feel in the holiday spirit, buy her some TV Ears. It'll provide great relief to you, as it did for us (a few years ago when we lived with Grandma)"
a5j5xf,"YTA- What exactly do you think sex education is? It’s education about sex. I guarantee you they probably told the students something like “you can still get stds from anal and oral sex”
If you didn’t want her involved you absolutely had the option to opt her out. Teenagers are getting an alarming amount of stds and unwanted pregnancies because of parents like you. "
a5jhl4,"NTA

It’s perfectly fine to decline an invitation when you don’t want to pay to attend."
a5jjbd,"NTA

Your friends had ample opportunity to do the work, even if they got a 0 it would be the mark they deserve."
a5jqw9,NTA. Some teachers are really anal about people working ahead. They like all students to stay on the same page which is stupid. You're definitely not the asshole for going at your own pace. Luckily when you get to college you'll have a lot more freedom when it comes to working ahead. 
a5jr71,NTA 
a5jscc,"NTA, it sounds like you took a screenshot and not blatantly plagiarized. You could have asked her first, but I don’t think that oversight makes you an asshole. You could also include a comment or edit the post to include her name now. She sounds pretty immature tbh and didn’t handle that like an adult. If I were you I’d either retroactively add her name, or simply share her post directly into your feed. But this doesn’t make you an asshole"
a5ju0v,NTA - good on you for trying to be considerate of other people who are also out trying to enjoy the evening. 
a5jxq7,"NTA

Your friend either wants to fuck you or he's decided that he also wants to fuck her, therefore needs you out of the picture."
a5jyai,"NTA but you need to realize that you could lose your relationship with your aunt over this (unless and until she’s willing to leave him). If you’re willing to stand your ground, please let her know that you’re always there for her if she needs you. The pull of an abuser can be strong and she needs to know that if and when she’s willing to leave, she’ll be supported. "
a5k48f,YTA because you seem to think you have the right to dictate both of your sex lives. He's expressed a preference for a mixture of sex and masturbation and you still want to insist on doing things your way? That's controlling and not your place.
a5k50s,"NTA - You spoke about it with them and even offered to pay more and they agreed. You now own that bedroom. However, I would start looking for a new place to stay or new roommates. It’s going to get more toxic from here."
a5k57m,"YTA because it's pretty gross to surprise send porn to people, no matter the sexual orientation of the people in it.  You're even more of an asshole if you sent it without a NSFW tag."
a5ka60,"YTA for being passive aggressive instead of telling him ""Editing takes time, I'll let you know when I have the pictures.  I have to finish my work for clients before I can edit for fun.""  It's understandable that you wouldn't want to hand over unedited photos because that's related to your professional reputation, but you're going to need to learn to stand up for yourself if photography is your living.  Don't reward people for being annoying, stand up for yourself."
a5khag,"YTA. Men are no less capable of caring for children than women are. If he’s an otherwise good candidate and the only strike against him is his gender, you’re not as open-minded as you think. "

Protecting his younger brother from a bully lands them BOTH in hot water somehow?  Like it or not, there ISN'T always a teacher available to help handle a conflict. It seems like you are teaching them that they don't have a right to defend themselves should the need arise.

a5l7lx,"NTA in my opinion. You said the marina company guys have a reputation for being assholes and I seriously doubt any smart business owner wants their company being represented that way. It’s bad enough that they resorted to such violence but by wearing the company sweaters they are representing their place of employment regardless of whether or not they are off the clock.

I ask because I understand the nerves if you’re on the younger end of the spectrum (under 25), but once you’re over that, meeting the parents shouldn’t be an issue - just adults meeting other adults. The whole “nuffin” and emojis makes me think you’re on the younger end.

Honestly hard to judge, I was leaning towards YTA at first.

Your going through a tough time, which gives you free passes to an extent on over reacting to some things. My impression of how she behaved was she was unhappy about the situation too - maybe not to the extent you were but she was more than likely still very concerned about your mother and you. Her day doesn't end just because you hang up the phone and she was probably looking towards an update on the situation all-damn-day.

You might wanna work on not shutting people out during times of tragedy, any partner is going to be upset by that to some degree. But I cant very well call you an asshole for having a human response to a death in the family. Try to look at it from her perspective too though."
a5x1ad,YTA. You’ve admitted you scream at her and chew her out for silly shit so of course she feels the need to hide something that may set u off (life a male friend) Telling her you cannot be with her cuz she didn’t do something with YOUR laundry is ridiculous. She needs to get away from you. 
a5x1nt,"YTA because you made her uncomfortable and are blaming her for telling an adult about it.

Like you said, it's a tricky situation. You're both living lives that makes your time together difficult to attain, but it seems like you have a system which generally works very well (fridays, saturdays, sundays spend time together, every other saturday you play DnD). 

You're not an asshole if you're sticking to that schedule by playing DnD this saturday. It's something that seems very routine. If she was really set on going to this race with you, she should have made it more clear than mentioning it once three weeks prior and then scheduling it a few days before.

But she's not an asshole either. She obviously works hard to make time for you, and she wanted to go to this race with you. Maybe she could have made that more clear, but it doesn't make her an asshole. She's not an asshole for being angry about it either. With a relationship built on time constraints like this, frustrations are bound to arise here and there. It sucks, but don't blame her for being a bit pissed off about it.

Now, going or not you won't be an asshole, but man to man it's probably better for you and your relationship with her to go to the race. Your friends will hopefully understand - there's plenty of other opportunities to play DnD, and doing this will clearly make her happy."

And maybe the experience you’d get from the new job will allow you to qualify for better jobs in the area you currently live and you can return in a few years.

I think your older daughter is old enough to know you’re not just abandoning her, and you will have the means to find creative ways to keep in touch.

Only you know your daughter, so talking with her will give you the insight you need. Money isn’t everything, but you could improve your family’s lives immensely in a relatively short time, as long as you don’t up your spending to match your income.

a650gm,"NTA. A year is a long time to go without seeing your SO. And right before leaving isn't a great time to start a relationship. I think it's better to wait until he gets back to start anything. Really, I think it's selfish on his part to bring this up now. "
a65ie3,"NTA. These people seem exhausting to deal with.

Also, what up fellow Portlander?"
a65jk4,"NTA.

Could you please come and clean my kitchen too? "
a65m8i,"NTA for not wanting to be stuck in a crappy living situation.  You're probably better off living by yourself, as long as you can continue to be friends with your group.  It might be hard to back out now without hurting people's feelings."
a65rr1,"YTA.  While you might know he never bites, how would a stranger know that?  Leash your dog."
a65wu4,"NTA, but why are you still interacting with this woman?  I know she's your mother, but she definitely doesn't sound like she's good for you or your mental health.  Having to lie just to explain standing up to her is not really a point in favour of further contact."
a662fh,[removed]
a665ar,"NAH. I get why you're mad and I probably would be too but if you wanted paying back you should have been clearer with your friend. If you've reassured them that you'll pay for the hotel, and if getting the hotel in the first place was your idea, I think it's fair enough that your friend let you do what you said you'd do. If you didn't ask your friend after the AirBnB refund, and didn't say anything about the hotel cost, it's a bit unreasonable to expect them to read your mind and offer it. "
a66811,"NAH.  I like to be left alone too.  This guy is probably just some lonely old man though and means no harm.  You wouldn't be the asshole if you told him that you'd prefer to just ride the bus in peace, though (easier said than done, I know)."

It sounds like this situation has happened before. Probably hard for her to recognize that that friendship might be toxic, and for you to confront her about when she's upset"
a66u4w,"NTA, it seems like you guys need sit down and have a talk. "
a66w85,"NAH - you've got anchors you can't let go of, she's got to get out of her bad space and grow. if neither of you can accept the other you are on a quick track for a break up. life circumstances change.
"
a6702u,"NTA - TLDR version. sister sucks too bad to deal with. mom wants you to like sister so mom proxy buys you a present and says it is from sister. 

take the present from mom and wear the happy face. if you absolutely cannot deal with having it around pass it one to donation. this is more about mom than the awful sister.
"
a678m4,"NTA - imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. once you put the idea into the world if it is any good you will have tag alongs. You'll just need to ride this out.

a67epf,"YTA. He's 5, he doesn't have a damned clue what he's doing. You're (presumably) an adult, and should have had more self control.

Edit: rephrase: the 5yo kid doesn't realize what he's doing is wrong."
a67hzc,"NTA at all

Your argument is valid, I agree completely.

However, law enforcement is constructed as a business. Businesses function on the principle of generating revenue. Regardless of your, or the PO’s opinion on this that’s just how it is. It’s a deeply rooted issue that impacts every single aspect of law enforcement and it is exactly why the system needs to be restructured. "
a67lee,NTA. he sounds like a douchebag 
a67otb,"NTA in the situation

But I'd say YTA for making the title as clickbaity as possible, making it seem as bad as you could possibly word it. If that's the case at least make it seem like there is ANYTHING that could make you the asshole. Not a single detail in the story that could make you the asshole (considering you only recently discovered about the ""possibility""(may have) of chicken chlamydia)



I'd call it a troll, but considering you know about disease spreading via chickens and using that for the story I'm  not sure if it is"
a67p6r,NTA I think in that that conversation you sounded perfectly reasonable and it was something she needed to hear. 
a67y0d,"NAH

She is just asking if it will be something you can do and you can't. She seems like a good person so she should understand. Be honest with yourself. Between working, going back to school, and taking care of your son; would you even have the time to be able to watch her daughter? It may seem like something you could squeeze in but with daily chores, homework from school, and getting enough sleep, it just isn't possible. Just be honest with her and good luck going back to school."
a67yaa,[deleted]
a684iu,"NTA, I don't think anyone would disagree it's ultimately your responsibility for your own save state, but her reaction was weird. "
a68bxq,"NTA, your ""friend"" is the asshole for doing that. Also, keep your head up man, no person is worth taking your own life. Sadness goes away and life moves on!

a693yx,"NTA. This is rude as fuck of him. You should never feel pressured to do anything you don't want to do, and skydiving is an oddly specific and very expensive thing to get for someone that's never ever mentioned it. Stand your ground, he'll either get over it or prove he's not a good partner"
a69cvb,"INFO

Are you in college or high school? And does missing the tests mean that you fail those classes?

Why didn't your parents want you to stay at home by yourself?"
a69h3p,"NTA.

I don't care if they were women, you a man, or they were carrying shit. It's public transportation, therefore rhe paying public is entitled to riding that train, with or without seats.

To be honest, she raced you ti get there first. They could've found seats elsewhere in another car,but wanted to be assholes about it so you're fine.

Unless the one standing was pregnant, or disabled, or with children you're good dude "
a69igs,"YTA. But, I am no better than you. Not in a million years would I tell my SO the truth about this freak accident. There is no point."
a69nrk,">'There was a growing fascination with the bizarre peoples who populated the new colonies.'

Yeah, that sentence was definitely not good.  When discussing ideologies like that in a literature class, you need to make it very clear what *you* believe.  It's not an objective history paper, it's an analysis.

I'm still saying NAH, though.  You're not an asshole, you're just not used to the specific conventions of the genre of writing yet."
a69rl6,"NTA - I had a colleague who had an unusual strategy for handling this.

when anyone asked him for non-professional advice he would give such absurdly bad, illegal, unethical, wildly inappropriate advice that people learned right away to not ask him.

ex: random coworker: ""man my wife and kids are hounding me about how much time I spend on work""

advice guy : "" put them into a wood chipper. save the output and make it into a chili that you eat so that they are always with you. now you can work as much as you want without neglecting them.""

advice guy was over the top inappropriate in his response, but only one time per customer.
"
a69w0u,"NTA. ""How do you know it was her?"" Uh, people saw her wearing it...



If you live together and maybe even if you don't, you need to call the police if your sister is unwilling to deal with this. Not for a talk, for the whole thing: finding the necklace and pressing charges. I'm sure this is all very stressful for her but this situation **must** be dealt with.



If you don't live together, you should stop hosting that part of your family in your home, including your sister.
"
a69whw,NTA but I’d probably stop commenting on people’s toilet paper choices that is a bit weird mate 
a6a258,"YTA. If she is going to pay in labor she is a tenant, and deserves to be treated like one. You seem to want to make a business transaction, be treated as a philanthropist. "

a6atx8,"NTA.  You aren't locked into buying a certain kind of product because of store credit.  Maybe it's a hassle because you could have done the exchange in one transaction instead of making the cashier have to go through a return, gift card, then another transaction."
a6b3ke,"NTA, you were vomiting blood.  You had way more important things to deal with than making a phone call.  "
a6baje,"Yeah, YTA.  Life isn't a competition, especially when finances are tough.  He's literally homeless--how can any rational person think that's a good time to make presents a competition?"
a6bayq,"NTA. The students are there to get the best education they can. That shouldn't be ruined by a poor teacher trying to ""climb the ladder"" without merit. I think it's almost your duty as an educator to do what you can to make sure the students receive the best education, and therefore, educator available. "
a6bgzx,"NTA. This professor sounds like a huge patronizing pain in the ass, and there’s no reason to give a failing grade due to formatting errors (even if your digital copy had also had the same errors.)

That said, it is usually possible to change a grade the next semester, at least in my experience, but this professor sounds like they’re going to make it a huge ordeal, so I’m sorry in advance. Wishing you the best op!"
a6bjgx,"NTA. With a little preemie just home, you have a perfect, ready-made excuse to have a private family Christmas with your new circle of three. Wouldn’t want Mister Man exposed to her drama and the germs of her brood, right? Shelter in place until your feelings settle."
a6bniv,"NTA. A pushover, but not the asshole. Why’d you apologize? He was taking advantage of you! "
a6btn0,"NTA — You’re 28. One of the best parts to adulthood is having autonomy regarding your attendance at social events. Talk to whoever you’re close to about it (your dad?) and tell them the situation. Maybe they can vouch for you and help back you up for not coming. If it’s *super* important for your dad that you’re there, consider going or not — maybe knowing it’s *for* him will make you feel better about it. It’s your decision, though, and I think either way—you’re NTA."
a6bv36,"ESH. So, you were definitely an asshole here. This is why:

> I admit some of my limbs may have went into the ""airspace"" of the person beside me but I never touched him.

Coming into someone's personal space without being invited makes you the asshole. It's all the worse because you did it without even noticing that were doing so. People so oblivious to the others around them are incredibly rude and annoying.

That being said.... he was an asshole too+. He's just another patron. He has no right to tell you to go back to your seat. At most, he could have gotten an usher, so the usher could do that (if he/she chose to do so). But for him to presume that he as the authority to do it himself makes him an asshole too."
a6c17b,"NTA. She’s in a shitty situation and you should absolutely be supportive, but the fact is you guys can’t afford for her to quit her job right now. All you can do right now is be supportive and try to get her the help she needs. But she’s just going to have to power through until some of the debt is paid off. You’re being reasonable and responsible here. "
a6c28x,YTA Why would you tell an 8 year old about this? They wouldn’t know how to process it. If anything wait until they’re older (at least 18) so they can come to terms about what’s going on. And even then it’s not your place to tell him 
a6c6t1,"ESH — Your friend is definitely an asshole for drugging you. That’s absolutely not cool. But you also seem like you have some serious emotional and psychological problems, poor/unhealthy coping mechanisms, and a tendency to not get help. It’s less likely that your mom, grandmother, and friend are just randomly conspiring against you and more likely that you have some serious problems and they’re just trying to help. You also seem to be (irrationally) afraid of medications that actually may help you.

You should consider ongoing therapy and working closely with a psychiatrist to find the best medications to support your rest and emotional health, while minimizing the side effects. It takes time, patience, and a willingness to give things a try with the knowledge they can always be changed slightly later. You should trust that you wouldn’t be prescribed these things if a competent professional didn’t think you could benefit from it. Get a second opinion if needed, but it’s time to get help and not refuse the tools that will help you get better."
a6cbsc,"NTA, but I think you know that. "
a6ckdr,"NTA. You've taken in a cat that has either been abandoned or neglected. Good for you. But, you should at least check to see if it has been chipped when you take it to the vet to get checked out. Barring putting up ""Found"" notices on a local reddit sub or on lampposts, I'm not sure how you are supposed to find its ""owners"" beyond checking for a chip."
a6cl0w,"You're obviously not the asshole. All you did was turn down a date. I don't think that has ever made anyone an asshole ever.

Blocking him was his own damned fault. If he's going to be persistent then he has to accept the consequences. He can't be upset about it if he has asked more than once. "
a6cmg0,NAH. Sounds like you both know who this is secretly *for.* Sounds like they are actually getting a lot of enjoyment out of it. I see no reason to feel bad.
a6cxbq,"YTA. Just ask her. If she says no, just buy some more. Or buy her the exact same one if she wants it. Communication is key. "
a6d1ib,"NTA

If it’s the photo he posted today.... it has over 200000 likes lmao omg why is he so upset?? It’s a celebrity, big deal. And it’s more revealing of the girlfriend than MGK?? lmaoooooooo what?? The only time I ever got upset at my boyfriend liking photos on insta was when it was a girl he used to date who posted a really racy/basically naked photo. I would never be upset over a celebrity. "
a6dqp7,"NTA. You should get a paternity test because you don’t want to be raising and paying for someone else’s child. And it’s better to know sooner rather than later. 

Unsolicited advice: do not get back together with her solely because she is pregnant, even if the baby is your’s. If you want to get back with her because you want to be with her, then cool. But don’t be with her just because she is pregnant. It will lead to a lot of issues down the road. "
a6ds7h,"NTA. But you are one for actually doing this and reward her manipulative behavior. 

Isn’t there a place you can go to in the meantime?"
a6dsne,"JFC please just break up. 

Both of you are extremely unhappy. ""Cunt mode""?

You admit you know you're an asshole here. 

You don't want to be married to a ""cunt"" and your hobby is more important. She gets upset, you call her a cunt. 

From what i'm reading it's pretty clear that you give exactly zero fucks about what she wants from this relationship. 

YTA for being a coward and hiding from the consequences of your own admitted asshole behaviour. 

Edit: SHP. Is she your wife or your girlfriend?

Edit 2: you routinely don't go home, don't tell her where you are, whine and beg for her to forgive you (but call her a cunt)... of course she thinks you're cheating on her. She cannot possibly trust you, and at this point probably has nothing but contempt for you. 

Edit 3: your wife is home alone with a 5 month old and she's pregnant. Fuck you, OP."
a6dthc,ESH. You people need to get away from each other.
a6dyzu,NTA. She lives there too. She needs to be pulling her own weight. 
a6e0o6,"YTA. It was *her* home. Just because the door was unlocked doesn't mean anyone can come in at any time. Sure, you were almost always welcome but you should have found her to let her know you would be her guest for the next 1 or 1,000 minutes."
a6e9vs,"1. They were assholes
2. You are spending time trying to figure out how to change yourself because of their assholeness to better fit in

Welcome to adulthood as a woman."
a6f01k,"NAH, misunderstandings, that’s it."
a6f1fw,"You're being to vague for this sub. 

Yes you should trust him but you also should be able to have peace of mind and he should help you with that within sound reason. 

Sound reason is the main thing, you cant expect someone to jump everytime you demand it right? But you'd hope to assume someone you're married to would do what they can for your peace of mind. 

Again. Clarify"
a6febt,"YTA

Normally I would say nobody sucks and you just need to talk to your partner about your issues. However, you mention that you secretly slept with your ex ""who had been a problem"" and now you're upset about your partner doing a similar thing? Turnabout is fair play."
a6ffb7,"NTA

You have to take care of yourself. Also it sounds like she’s not a very good friend in return and only is friendly when she needs something. 

Part of growing up is learning to sever ties with toxic people and your ‘friend’ is severely toxic."
a6ffke,NAH this is just a simple issue that most couples have at one point or another. There’s obviously some missing  communication that could have solved any animosity or resentment here. No reason to hold a grudge about it 
a6frtt,"NTA.

You need a hobby and a new boyfriend."
a6ggz1,"NTA, but this is not going to change. Her relationship with her family is obviously important, your ability to socialize with them is not going to magically increase. If your can set a boundary, now, in a way that your girlfriend will understand, then this relationship has a chance. I would suggest making it about space and time for yourself, not about her family specifically. Otherwise I can tell you from experience that this is just going to get worse for you. Probably for them as well."
a6gyxi,NTA. Though life protip never ask why someone isn't drinking.
a6hao3,"NTA.  You're doing what you need to do for money, and selling nudes isn't exactly the same as escorting.  Stay safe but don't rely on this money going forward.  He can bail at any time and it's not like you can file for unemployment or use this on a resume."
a6hc5r,"YTA.  She can do whatever she wants with her own dog's poop on her own property, but you need to pick up after yours.  It's like peeing, if you splash yourself with your own, whatever, you'll clean up.  Someone else splashes on you?  Awful."
a6hg0k,NTA- what a weird way to lead up to telling your girl that you bought YOURSELF a present. 
a6hmqy,NTA. Charitable donations are made because ***you*** want to make a donation. Being pressured makes the other person/entity the asshole.
a6hpez,"NTA. A vacation is something that is supposed to be enjoyable. If your mother invites someone that you do not like, you have no obligation to spend time with that person. "
a6hq4n,"NTA.

You should text her back and explain ""You offered me $11.30.""  Odds are she will respond ""We only give raises of X %.""  Respond to that with ""Regardless, you already offered me $11.30 and I would like that raise.""  There is a decent chance she will give you the $11.30.  But do not get angry or emotional.  Don't talk about how hard you work or how much you could use the money.  Don't call her a liar or make a big deal about the change in the amount of the raise. Just say ""I'd like the raise you initially offered me.""

But if I were you I would immediately start calling other daycares and asking what wages they offer for daycare worker with your level of experience.  I'd avoid giving your name or the place you work if possible.  Just tell them you are currently employed at looking at other options.  I think it is very possible that you could be making more money at a different facility.  I wouldn't wait to hear back from your boss to do this.  It is the weekend and people might not answer the phone, but don't leave a voicemail or send an email.  Call now and if they're not open, call before you head to work on Monday.  Find out what the going rate is.  "
a6i0jn,NTA. I'm legit fearful for your safety to be quite honest. 
a6ib78,"NTA for appealing.  Don't try to pull a fast one on them by swapping the work, though.  Do you really think no one will notice?"
a6ieuo,"NTA, but it sounds like you need to have a serious talk about this relationship because you're clearly on different pages about how to do long-distance.

Never, **never** feel bad about not wanting to send suggestive pictures.  It's your body and your choice.  For me personally, it's a hard no regardless of any circumstances, and that's okay."
a6iiwa,Yes it is asshole dick licking thunder cunt 
a6iobf,"YTA for flipping out. She tried to call you about it and you didn't answer. OK, maybe you're not comfortable having your room unlocked, which is fair enough, but did you really have to treat her like that? Why couldn't you just ask her not to do that again?

Also, it's not the same as her leaving the door wide open. Most people will assume a closed door is a locked door, so it's highly unlikely someone would have tried their luck in those few minutes."
a6iqjt,"NTA. It sounds like you covered it all. You weren't there a lot of the time so got the blame for everything. Fuck em. Keep your stuff in your room, until they learn some manners and gratitude. "

Reminds me of a comment on reddit a few months ago. Woman in first class (on an aeroplane) askes the person next to her to swap seats with her husband in 3rd class, so they could sit together. Got offended when told that whoever was sat next to her husband would love to swap seats with her. "
a6jj43,"YTA, assuming this isn’t a SHP. 

There’s so much wrong with this. 

Messing around with a girl who likes to play mind games.

You clearly have issues with her being a sex worker. If you can’t treat her with respect, don’t date her. "
a6johi,"NTA, she took in the cat and basically let it fend for itself. She ditched the cat. She should have taken it when she went to her boyfriend's.

not related comment: Also a poly relationship? I LOOOVE. "
a6joo6,"NAH. If you had gotten mad at the family, you certainly would’ve been the asshole of the situation. Autistic children are very very hard to handle, and you simply can’t expect every parent to “bend over backward” to accommodate for you. They didn’t mess with your home or anything, and seemingly left without issue, so I don’t think they were at any fault, and I don’t think you should feel personally offended."
a6jujv,"NTA. You had previously told him that this was what you wanted to do for your birthday. Since he kept asking you that, I would assume that he intended whatever you chose to be your birthday gift. But then instead you ended up buying HIS shit.

I don’t want to know shit about the people I work with. "
a6jxfv,"INFO. Depends how good friends you two are, why they broke up, and if he treated her well. If a friend of mine stayed friends with an ex I broke up with relatively amicably (preferably after talking to me first), I think I'd be fine. If it was an ex who cheated on me or something, I'd be less happy. Even so grown adults can be friends with who they like, she can't control who you want to see. "
a6jy3h,"NTA. If he can't perform the work for this position, it was inappropriate of the company to put him there."
a6jzf7,"NTA.  She is an adult and can make her own choices about her own life.  Once those choices start negatively impacting your life, however, you have every right confront or to try to contain her.  If this isn't something you can handle on your own, and it very likely isn't, then don't hesitate to escalate this to your RA or whomever else you can.

Not only can Drunky make you miserable with vomitastic adventures, she can cause you serious harm.  Also, vomiting while drunk isn't just gross, it's presents a very real danger from choking to death on it.  This is serious, and treat it that way."
a6k6y4,"NTA - if he could afford a three week vacation, he should be able to  afford a cab ride home from the airport. If he says it’s because he wanted to see you, he wouldn’t have canceled the date. It’s normal to expect a SO to do things like pick you up at the airport, but with him knowing the situation it’d put you in, it seems kinda selfish for him to expect this"
a6kjy2,"NTA. he honestly just sounds like a baby for getting mad at something like that. You just wanted a beer. So what if it's a little expensive if you'll pay him back. No need for you to explain you aren't a golddigger, nothing you did insinuated that anyways. "

a6na8e,"NTA. You need to be very careful with how you handle this. First, the DNA test doesn't prove that your maternal grandfather isn't your mother's father. Second, if you want to bring it up, give your mom the results and let her come to her own conclusions. "
a6ncgm,"NTA for not wanting strangers in your house after 1 AM.  Even if you were neurotypical, you have every right now to want people around at that hour."
a6nlbt,"NTA. Get out of there, violence is not ok."
a6npst,"YTA / NAH. It sounds like you were verbally and emotionally quite supportive of her. That's always nice. However, I've never heard of anyone going to Panera to celebrate. Panera isn't really a restaurant. It's just healthier fastfood. In my mind, if you have some disposable cash, Panera is not the place to go to celebrate a graduation. Financially, it's obvious that you put way more money into celebrating your friend's graduation. I don't know how much you're struggling, or how stringent of a budget you're on... If it's a significant strain where you two can't afford flowers or an actual restaurant, then I do think she's being ungrateful... but I sense that is not the case. I don't know if I'd compare the two situations, since that seems a bit in poor taste, but... I don't know what sort of dynamic you two have, or how open you are about your feelings."
a6nra3,"NTA stay away!

The post is a bit confusing as at the beginning you say you've only known her for a short time, then all the examoles make it sound like several years. Then you say 26 days. Stay away. "
a6nvx9,"NTA, if not a SHP. This is pretty funny, honestly.

If you're serious, you're not the asshole; just a well-meaning consumer, who ought to be more wary of salesmen. "
a6ocyd,Seems like getting married to this person is not the greatest of ideas. NTA
a6oe87,">e blew HALF his savings on a $21k (2ct) diamond ring

Honestly, when people do this it absolutely boggles my mind. 

NTA, but your brother's fiance (if she knew about the 21k ring) and your brother are.

Good luck in marriage "
a6of9b,"YTA. Not for removing someone from your life, but for doing it with no explanation. A friend cut me off with no explanation several years ago, and I still wonder what I did wrong. It's very anxiety provoking.

If you feel like you've outgrown this person, grow a pair and tell her. It doesn't sound like she deserves to be thrown away like a piece of trash. If you can't talk, at least write to her. Everyone needs closure when a relationship ends. "
a6onwm,"NTA. They said they were coming (for your birthday no less), did a no-show, didn't even give you an explanation and now want to get upset because you won't go to their Christmas dinner? Fuck that. These people are not your friends. Even the worst of my friends would have at the very least told me that they couldn't come at the last minute. Cut them loose, be honest and direct as to why if they ask, and find some real friends."
a6ozgm,"I can't say YTA but I can't say you're NTA, either. I can understand not finding a nose ring attractive, but I can't understand your level of discomfort with it that you would break up with someone you love. Is it a trigger of some kind? 

I don't like nose rings, but if my husband got one I'd still love him. I would let him know I think they're ugly, and he could take or leave the consequences of that. 

What's interesting to me is your reply to her question about how you'd behave if she became disfigured. You didn't say you'd stay because you love her. You said you'd stay because it's the right thing to do. Nobody wants to feel like an obligation."
a6p23h,YTA spiders are our friends :(
a6p2vm,"NTA. But, saying you wanted her to hear the conversation so she ""realizes her opinions aren't held universally"" kinda tells me you don't really respect her political views. Most people know their opinions aren't universal and to think you're going to be the one to ""open their eyes"" basically says to me you think they only hold their opinions because they don't know there are other opinions. 

Also, I think bringing it up after the fact would just imply you think she can't handle being in the same room as people with other opinions, which is kinda rude, so I wouldn't do that. "
a6pbsl,"I mean kind of yeah YTA think about that poor girl. That video is out in the world now because some creep took a video of her showering. It's not your job to help but don't you think that if you CAN do something then you should? If you're against heavy surveillance, well her being filmed naked was some heavy surveillance. "
a6pof9,"NTA. Do it. I wouldn't blame you either, and I'd likely do the same thing. I know a lot of people who freak the fuck out if a 25+ lb dog runs up to them, even if they are friendly. There are reasons why there are leash laws. This is one of them."
a6prmj,"NTA, although to many people it will sound like asshole behavior. 

This is a problem in our house as well. Hundreds of dollars gets spent on junk that no one needs and real needs get delayed. 

Several years ago, I told everyone not to buy me junk that’s going to clutter up my house and be in the garbage in 6 months. I added that they are under no obligation to buy me anything, and they aren’t. I just don’t want anyone’s money wasted on cheap trinkets that I’m not going to use. "
a6ptsy,"NAH - this is a really hard situation and you seem like nice people. I guess you just have to think she's old and has no-one and would you like it if you needed help at that age and someone just stopped answering the door for you? I know it's not your responsibility, but she is alone and vulnerable and compared to that, the inconvenience she causes you is probably small"
a6pu2x,NTA. These people chose sides in your divorce which makes me wonder if they ever actually cared about you as a friend. They’re trying to pretend that they never ghosted you. That’s just fucked up. 
a6pxo2,"NTA, you can do what you want.

But, you may want to consider as kindly and calmly as humanly possible explaining what the problem is. Don't let her guilt you into coming if you don't want to, but make sure that she knows precisely what about her behaviour is unacceptable. And then suggest she seek some kind of therapy. Maybe this is how family holidays always were when *she* was your age. Maybe something about everything *not being perfect* freaks her out, because someone used to freak out at her when things weren't perfect and now she's got a little voice in her ear saying *you've messed up the stuffing again*."
a6pz82,NTA they are probably testing the water to see if how open you are to working for free. Never do unpaid overtime. Weekend work should be paid at double time rate. 
a6q3he,"So if you go on a month long vacation you don't have to pay anything? No rent, no gas, no light?
And the other people living there are expected to pay for the one that's gone?

Seems crazy.

I can't call the bank and tell them I won't pay the mortgage because I've been away for a month. "
a6q5i4,NTA they are being cruel to an animal that would be in less pain if it was dead my dog died a couple years ago we put him down because he was blind would not move and was limping he was 15 i think it is not only the respectful thing to do to let your dog die peacefully but also the only way to relieve her pain your family is delaying the inevitable at the cost of the dogs well being
a6qlqz,"NTA for being angry. But, do you really want to be around people who don't want to be around you? Fuck them."
a6qryp,"NTA

Your dad’s probably going through a hard time, but that doesn’t mean you have to bend over backwards to meet all his demands."
a6qt3f,"NTA, I dont know anyone who hasn't hid food from their roommate"
a6qzt0,"YTA - not the asshole for being concerned (at ALL!) but definitely for this part:

>So yesterday I told her - for her own safety - that I wouldn't allow her to keep seeing him unless I was allowed to meet him in person. So yeah. Line in the sand. 

How exactly do you plan to enforce that, seeing as how your sister is an adult? O.o"
a6rfmj,"YTA

They were trying to be nice. I understand you have anxiety but you let it get the best of you and were rude and standoffish. You assumed the worst of everything they said. "
a6rklg,NAH. You made sure that your stepmother had an amazing birthday and got her a funny birthday card. Your dad and her misunderstood the joke due to a generational difference. A bit of an overreaction but your stepmother seems to acknowledge the genuine misunderstanding in the end so it should blow over in no time. 
a6rn55,"NTA, you're not obligated to give a manipulative creep your attention.  If he hurts himself, it's his own fault.  Nothing he does is your fault.  Please report him to YouTube for harassing you."
a6rp36,"ESH. You know she's insecure and you didn't need to call her out in front of everyone.  She sucks for being a show off, but some kids learn how to be confident by showing off then reeling it in.  She's good at singing and is obviously proud of herself.  You could speak with your director and let them know she's really distracting you but you don't want to hurt her feelings.  They can handle it.  "
a6rpfd,ESH he was a little insensitive with his joke and you over reacted to a joke that basically *everyone* makes when someone is sick. 
a6rstv,"YTA, i think your mom just wanted to bond and make her house feel home-y. Plus, not everyone can afford or feel the need to get new decorations. My parents didn't when they split. "
a6ry03,"NTA, don't offer to take people out to eat and then expect them to pay.  Good on you for calling him out on the lack of tip.  When people don't tip, often times the server has to take a loss because they owe other tipped staff a percentage of their total sales."
a6s4xt,NTA. Probably wouldn’t be what your grandmother had in mind but she gave it to you as a present so like it’s yours to spend how you want now. 
a6s6kv,"NTA. This guy didn’t even keep the bird in its cage. Like, if you’re cleaning it, make sure you have all your supplies first!

Sending you new roommate vibes."
a6sean,"YTA for ignoring their policy, but you don't have to go back anywhere that doesn't work for you.  They have a no-outside-food policy, but you don't care.  Having seating is a courtesy to guests, not a place for you to sit around and have the lunch you brought from elsewhere.

>My wife spilled her hot coffee on her while in the car. She's fine and car is ok too. (Thank you bagel shop for a paper towel roll's amount of napkins)

>-My wife also spilled the coffee on her at our house while sitting on the couch. She again was fine, was just another thing to clean.

This is all your wife's fault.  Her clumsiness has nothing to do with the coffee shop.
"
a6sepr,YTA for lying.  Get different friends if you don't want to interact with them.  Tell them you need alone time when you want alone time.  No one wants to be friends with someone who can't keep lies out of their mouth.  Don't be shocked when they stop reaching out because you're full of excuses.
a6su5b,"YTA and seriously, get over it. If a girl doesn't like you, she doesn't like you. Nothing to really do about it, she's not an asshole because she doesn't like you. Also, you should be happy for your friend for being with someone. Quit your bitching, find another girl, and then this won't be a big deal at all.

Bros before hoes goes both ways. Don't end a friendship just because they are dating someone you once liked. It would he one thing if you and that girl dated, but you never dated she just rejected you. She has no obligation to date you/not date your friend, and your friend shouldn't be forced to not date someone because of you

Learn how to use spell check, and grow the fuck up"
a6t0nc,"NTA, but 

If she keeps bringing it up, and offering to make payments, you should accept that.  It's good faith, and that may work much better for her, and you need it to work for her or you won't get the money back.

She's TA for reasoning that you don't need your money right now.  Not for her to say.

But if you don't need the money right now, and she's family and you like her, a payment plan can be a nice compromise.

You were a good person for helping her out when you did.  Keep being a good person, and work with her so that it's easy for her to be a good person too.  "
a6t7go,"YTA. You're seriously not going because they asked you not to take your dog? You can leave it with a dog sitter. I'm not surprised they're upset with you. I had a dog too and as much as I loved taking him places, if he wasn't welcome I had to respect that. But I would still go!"
a6te7p,"if not SHP then ESH.

No need to steal.  "
a6tik4,"YTA. Who cares what a little kid is wearing? If he's wearing a police costume, is he impersonating an officer? Are you gonna report him? Get a life."
a6tley,"Dude. I take care of our kids for free. Some of that money is mine. That's what he doesn't understand. And this is money that's left over from shopping, or paying for dinner. I'm not allowed to hide some pocket change for our benefit? I took care of him for the first year of our relationship and he was doing the same shit. I'm not spending it on anything but the family. I'm not out at sephora or the spa. Seriously?!"
a6tlu0,YTA. You seem to think you have a right to investigate what he was doing. It’s none of your business. He doesn’t have to explain it to you. Why are you so obsessed with someone else’s choices? If you don’t feel he’s a good friend then you should go ahead and break off the friendship. That’s your right. You are his friend. Not his mother. He doesn’t owe you any explanation. 
a6tn26,"NTA. You tried to help him, and he’s been lying to you/cheating on you. I think it’s perfectly fair to cut him off."
a6tphj,"NTA.

Might be an unpopular opinion, due to the act being illegal. But he's an adult, you're an adult, and the girl was an adult, I'm having a hard time seeing how you could be an asshole. The parents make think you are, but your nephew was comfortable coming to you with an admittedly awkward situation. It means he trusts you, which I think is a positive thing."
a6tvp6,"NAH. If you accept the gift. If you refuse it, depending on how it's handled between the two of you, you *might(?)* become the asshole. If it's not a financial hardship and they did it out of gratitude, accept the gift in the spirit it was offered."
a6ty4f,"NTA. The kid's two! Maybe for everyone's sake, try just using it while he's not around or asleep though. That would probably be helpful for all parties involved.

EDIT: made a typo! "
a6tyvb,"YTA. You're not the body police. If she can't find anything that looks good on her, then she should try some different stores. 

You glance over the fact that she's depressed and make it seem like weight is her biggest problem.  And you focus on the fact that she's bigger than you and your friends. Seriously, who cares? You sound like a proper ass.  "
a6u4iz,"NTA.  You have every right to quit a job at any time for any reason.  You're clearly just a paid body to them, so why should they matter any more to you?"
a6u81k,"It was two people: me, and her boyfriend. Not exactly sure what the caption was, aside from the close paraphrasing of what I wrote above. "
a6ukmc,"NTA. Good on you for standing your ground! (and also impressive money handling on both your and Es account!).

I hope your next year gets better, at least in general. "
a6uo0k,"NTA, but your SIL is though for sure. Dont feel guilty at all. I cant believe she threw a last min party on your actual daughter's birthday. Everyone has to be seeing thru that bullcrap for what it is. "
a6uuxw,"NTA Greg sounds extremely narcissistic. Threatening to hurt himself after the breakup is attention-seeking, manipulative behaviour. Posting the drama for everyone to see and telling everyone about your sex life with an unrelated party is attention-seeking manipulative behaviour."
a6uvi6,"NTA - since that one missed day would have been enough points to bump him to the A he wanted, I think he made his own bed and now he has to lie in it. 

Info? - what is a top hat code? How is requesting access to it cheating? Did they have a legitimate reason to miss class? If he had the access to the top hat code would it have been the 03 he needed to get to an A? 

I do think it’s a bit weird to be marked down a point for being 4 mins under the maximum presentation time. That also seems like a fair amount of time to leave for people to ask questions, but if they didn’t ask many then it doesn’t seem like the presenters problem? 

**Edited now that new information has been provided.**"
a6uw6z,Jesus Christ you can't grab a knife and run out after somebody while you're drunk. That's absolutely madness.
a6uynt,"You're asking someone to be polite to a child molester. Think about that for a second.

Is he gonna have to be polite when he rapes his grandkids too?"
a6uzsr,"NTA. But you need to be more assertive, if not in the moment, then upfront. If you can't say it to his face then email or text. 

Something along the lines of, ""I truly value our friendship but when you push me into sexual situations, I feel like you are not listening to me and do not value our friendship, but merely see it as a means to an end."" Maybe even throw in that he knows about and is exploiting your past with sexual/relationship violence if that's the case.

If you can't say this to him, you need to stop putting yourself in one-on-one situations with him because you know what he'll do. You say he's ""not a bad guy at all"" but if he keeps willfully ignoring a boundary you've informed him of multiple times, is he really?"
a6v0wn,"NTA.  If they said 5-10 minutes but took nearly an hour, you can't possibly be expected to miss your obligations for them."
a6v1ei,Feminazi? If a girl is attacking me I have every right to hit her. I’m not giving a girl a pass to abuse me. 
a6v5zf,"YTA if you actually phrased it that way. It comes off as a jab on her language abilities, and is just unnecessarily rude."
a6vbnh,NTA - I think if it doesn’t work out then it doesn’t work out so you should do what you want due to it being your own time. I do think they deserve an explanation on things. 
a6vkd1,NAH but if you’re really this stressed about potential pregnancies then you need to at least use condoms. 
a6vm8y,YTA for not taking him to the vet.  I'd bet you're not qualified to decide whether the dog needs surgery.  It's shittier to let your dog stay uncomfortable than have an actual professional evaluate how to help him.
a6vprb,"Being under 25 the insurance was going to cost me 2,500 a year on a bike only worth 6,000 to begin with. So didn't seem worth it to me "

Shitpost"
a6vslg,"NTA. Here's the thing, people often don't take into consideration that being a member of a wedding party costs money. Not everyone can afford it. Hopefully you got them a card because you might be the asshole if you didn't do that.

Also, did you express to them what you told us here?"
a6w24w,"YTA - kind of, most people would assume when you buy a game system at least one controller would come with it. "

It's your trip.  Do it how you want."
a6w86j,"NTA, i'm a woman and i'm not insecure enough to think that watching porn is cheating--no offense to your girlfriend."
a6wc88,"NTA. Anyone you were with for 10 years is going to have some ties to your place!

But I suggest buying some roses, drying them, and replacing the ones you bought your ex. "
a6weyx,NAH. Seems like she changed her mind and you rejected her because she rejected you. I think it's a communication issue.
a6wswv,"NTA. But are you sure your cousin would actually be upset by this? It’s crazy, yes, but it happened ages ago and involved people none of you have ever met. They probably already know or suspect that some members of the family were enslaved and that some members owned slaves.

If I were in your shoes, I’d tell your cousin and aunt privately and let them know that you won’t share this information with the rest of the family unless they are okay with it. They might be upset by it, but depending on their view of things, maybe they’ll think it’s fascinating."
a6xcf0,"NTA. Clearly NTA. 

But I was a teen until not so long ago so let me try to explain why your daughter don't want to play Minecraft with you (since she couldn't from your story) : She's playing with her friends (Well, I think she is if she's on a server). And having Dad come over is just THE MOST embarrasing thing for girls of her age. It's not that she's ashamed of you, it's just that kids are kids, and when they'll see you barge in trying to act like a ""cool dad"" (believe me, 99.9% of ""cool dads"" are actually just embarrasing themselves), she (thinks she) will be the laughing stocks at school for the next decade. 

So, as a piece of advice for next time : If she tells you she doesn't want to do something with you, just say ""ok"". Her grandma is right in a way, you won't build a relationship with her if you keep insisting after she tells you ""No"". I understand you want to bond with her in any way you can, but it will work more if she doesn't have to explain her feelings. It's not that she hates you or anything, it's just how teen works. 

It's just an hypothesis and she might not think that way but from what I've guessed from your story I think it's the most likely explaination"
a6xeou,"NTA. She sounds like a drama queen, especially if she was already comfortable flexing her ass and having people punch it "
a6xi27,"NTA. What he did was completely inappropriate and whether he was drunk or not is not an excuse. WTF, unhooking your bra during a hug? BS. That's just harassment. You have every right to be upset that he touched you inappropriately, and to be upset at your boyfriend for not standing up for your boundaries. 

I personally would stay away from Brian, he clearly does not understand or respect boundaries. "

Getting away is necessary to test one’s mettle.  I am concerned about the debt.  Look for all scholarships possible!"
a6xq7w,"NTA, if they really were being as aggressive about drinking/pot as you say, that's fully understandable why you'd be annoyed"
a6xx4r,"YTA. 
She barely knew you at all and still took care of you. 

In the long scheme of your life, spending about five hours (travel both ways and the extremely short wedding) are minuscule, by comparison, to the 3650 hours (five months) she looked after mini-you. 

My two cents. "
a6xyvu,"NTA clearly, to be honest even though people might think this post is easy to answer, I can see where you’re coming from. We’re talking about a charity and you not willing to pay can seem a bit bad if your feelings are in the way.
Don’t give her the money and if it becomes too bothersome, point her to your hourly rates and tell her that you’ll pay her 5$ when she pays you for the job. It’s r/choosingbeggars territory right there."
a6yddx,"YTA, they're all adults, they can do what they want to do. You don't have to get involved in any of the sexual stuff, but they can do whatever they want to do, so long as they're not pressuring you to get involved. "
a6ydwl,"NTA. You couldn't have known that he was autistic, and you acted properly for your role in the situation. Your role was to ensure the safety of those in the theatre, which required throwing him out. The mom, albeit in a horrible situation, could have run after him or could have asked you to call the police. She knows him better than you and what he's likely or not likely to do in that situation. Sounds like you acted responsibly. "
a6zh1z,"ESH 

Your relationship with him sounds very serious and him seeing someone else sounds like cheating but why would you just ghost him? You're an adult, you know that will make him wonder forever about what happened. Don't pretend you'd do that to spare his feelings.

Talk to him. Tell him you know he was cheating on you and end it. Then he can ""continue things with this other girl and still be happy without "" you since that's what you say you want. 

TBH he met up with your friends with this girl so he wants you know. It sounds like you're both playing games."
a6zj8j,Not an asshole no but start evaluating how much you want to let a single experience negatively impact your life like that.
a703qi,Sure it’s annoying but don’t be such a drama queen. Just don’t stand there for 10 minutes. 🤷🏻‍♀️
a7040t,"NTA, it's your house and you get to decide who comes through the door. However, as you said he is young, he was raised that way, and he may not yet have had a chance to change his mind, so try not to write him off forever."
a706w1,"NAH. You just met the guy this year, it was nice of you to think of him when you did. He probably thought he could finally let his guard around you and be himself. I suggest talking to him about it, but if he's not responsive to it, hey, it's been less than a year. "
a70d0j,"NTA. 

First of all it is outdated. Second you did ask permission. Third you are not a mindreader so how would you know just exactly how they wanted you to ask. 

The big deal is asking the bride, not her father lol."
a70d6u,"> I think it stems mostly from a complete lack of motivation to talk to people.

They could be an introvert? Or They could be battling depression. 

 > So I shared this with him and told him I don’t want him to stop coming to our hangouts, I just want it to be an “every now and then” thing.

This does not help an introvert or someone battling depression. 

ESH. 

They should have maintained contact with their friends. You suck because you want to exclude him from the group. Have you ran this by the group? Their thoughts?

Also, you could do a little more to encourage they reconnect with their old pals. "
a70hxb,"NAH, but it’s a bit petty. I think it’s implied, personally, and you shouldn’t take it personally"
a70nhu,"NTA but your CEO is.  If he thinks she deserves to get fired he shouldn't set her up to fail, he should just do it.  You shouldn't risk pissing off the CEO just because you feel bad for her; it sounds like she does deserve to get fired anyway."
a70qvh,"NTA, but, I feel like this story has more to it. Like was the reason that your parents had a huge falling out bad enough that if you weren't their daughter, you wouldn't want anything to do with your father? "
a70s5h,"NAH -- this is what happens to friendships my dude. They're either a priority or they're not. You got busy and moved on, and so did she. "
a70sbg,"YTA, as well as the bastards sat in the middle lane. I know it's fucking annoying, I hate it too, but overtaking on the wrong side is still dangerous, regardless of whether it's easier for you or not."
a70vjk,"NTA You should not feel responsible for someone's bad money management or lack of parenting. I would understand if she didn't have a car to get around but she does. It's not your fault her vehicle has bad gas mileage. Also, it's not your fault her husband is too lazy to drive. "
a70xhj,"NTA because she's been proving herself a liability. You could give her one last chance but to be honest it doesn't seem like it's working out. 

Who knows, maybe sitting down with her could ser her straight. But you can't blame yourself for her incompetence. "
a70yyp,"NTA.

Your SO clearly has some trust issues that need to be worked out. 

I've been exactly in your shoes when I was younger. It ain't healthy. She needs to trust you - is she going to throw a fit everytime you speak to another woman?

She's your girlfriend, but she doesn't own you. Remember that."
a70zno,"NTA - but hear me out. The odds of getting matched with someone are so small. I’ve been on that list for 15 years, since I turned 18, and I’ve never been called. I probably never will be.

So if people are signing up so they look good but intend to flake later, okay....

.... but what happens if one of those people gets a call. And suddenly, they’re told “you could legit save someone’s life.”

Think they might change their minds? I think there’s a chance they might. And that would make it worth it. Some jackass screwing off in high school (I’m assuming) 10 years down the line has the chance to save someone’s child? 

They’re assholes now because most teenagers are. But in 10 years they might not be. Just something to consider. "
a714r5,"YTA.  Stop trying to contact your victims.  You may be a better person now, but you can't erase your past crimes."
a71don,"YTA - it’s one thing to keep it to yourself, and another to be directly asked and lie. 

For a number of reasons. 

One - this woman figured it out. You not confirming it is going to shake her confidence and make her question her own reasoning and sanity - not cool.

Two - Dave is an asshole. He has a side piece and is bragging to you? He wants to get caught.

Three - you’re not doing their marriage any favours by letting her carry on deceived.

You can repair this. You need to stop by their house when Dave isn’t home. “Look, you called me and you caught me off guard. The truth is, Dave is seeing someone. I don’t feel comfortable getting any more involved in that, but I was uncomfortable with the lie and felt you deserved the truth.”"
a71fq2,"YTA for being angry with them. You are plenty old enough to be living on your own regardless of your educational status. I don't think you can blame your parents for not wanting to continue to support someone who is closing in on a decade of being an adult. 

Just about everyone ends up in a situation where they move out and are broke as shit in their 20s. Its almost a rite of passage. Respect their wishes, find some roommates and move out. "
a71m5p,"NTA. Legally she has to tell you to take an ambulance (it’s a liability thing). It’s common to refuse, although you will normally have to sign a form to release the doctor from liability if something happens. Ambulances are expensive and so people refuse all the time. "
a71qoy,"NTA. You're neighbor should be more respectful of the common area that you and your pets all share.  You expressed yourself in a reasonable and polite manner. 

Also, you named your dog Eevee, which I think means that you are incapable of being the asshole."
a71qve,NTA. You're way overthinking this. You firmly and directly asked them to be quiet and to be respectful. Absolutely nothing wrong with that. 
a71xvs,"NAH.

You seem to have decided that you can only choose between the two nuclear options of ""be total best friends"" or ""burn this bridge to ashes."" When most people figure out they don't want to be close friends anymore, they just kind of drift apart amicably and maybe send each other a Christmas card every year. Is that not a workable option for you? I don't think you need to make a big confrontation out of it."

a72guz,"NAH.  It's understandable that you want to sleep in the same bed for your partner.  Some people really can't sleep next to another person, but I don't think separate bedrooms is the next step here.  If he can't sleep, he could try melatonin or let his doctor know that his sleep quality is poor.  If he wants his own bedroom, he needs to sacrifice his office to move in there.  "

a72qgf,"NAH. If she is really that affected by the ""gratuitous suffering of animals,"" what the hell is she doing at a zoo in the first place?"
a72yck,YWNBTA. It sounds like she is manipulative and abusive. You would do well to look out for your own needs instead of being guilted into a relationship with you mother when she has pushed everybody else away. 
a73128,"ESH - There is a lot of information that we don't have, and frankly the communication in your relationship just flat out sucks. 

But - she just got a new job. Part of new jobs is a real lack of ability to take time off, and it's a bit of a faux-pas to start asking for time off when you are brand new. You want to show how awesome, dedicated and hard working you are in your first impressions phase. She's not wrong to reduce her vacations when she is trying to get in good. 

What she should have done is communicated to you better that she would be able to take less time off, and you should have supported that. However, I get the impression you were less than understanding from your "" I told her to tell her new boss about the trips prior to accepting the offer"" 

Like she is going to torpedo a new job by telling a prospective employer, ""oh, I need these days off, and these ones, and these ones too.."" I mean, she told them about half? How many trips do you have planned, that she could cut it by half and still be a significant number? "
a731hu,"YTA.  Her boundaries are just that--**her** boundaries.  You don't get to say who touches her how.  If you're uncomfortable, you should take it up with her, not him."
a7327z,Obviously NTA. Your coworker sounds like an actual child. 
a732nm,YTA -- Why should other people have to see your dog's poop bags on the sidewalk just because you can't be bothered to carry them around with you?  You also assume that people who see you leaving the poop bags on the sidewalk also see you come back to retrieve them later.  I'm sure that most people just assume that you're not returning and are expecting someone else to pick them up for you -- which is undoubtedly what has happened on a few occasions.
a73h8q,"EHS - it seems messed up of your dad to cut her out because he disagreed with her religious conversion / who she married. I think it’s weird you aren’t more empathetic to your sister and her situation considering the way you worded your post makes it seem like you know it was an unfair reason for your dad to cut her out. 

You also seem to have a “DGAF it’s mine now” attitude and are justifying it by using your mother as an excuse. This seems really off, like you know it’s wrong but the money benefits you so you’re going to go along with what dad said as a way to clear your conscious. 

It’s also messed up of your sister to put you on the spot, she should contest the will through legal channels if she feels she was cut out unfairly. If there was a prior will that showed she was at one point entitled she may legally be able to make the case to have the will reverted. But, it also seems like she might think she’s owed money just because, which frankly no one should expect. "
a73l8g,"NAH for having feelings.

But she is your girlfriend, not your wife, so she doesn’t have any obligation to share 100% of her money with you, nor you with her.

You're not entitled to his Netflix, but I get why you feel that you should have priority over an ex. Ultimately if you push the issue, you'll eventually get your way, but he will be annoyed. It sounds like he is just a nice dude, and sharing is caring or whatever.

a74h34,"NTA. Nobody has the right to your company, and your SO is fully within her right to refuse to see her family, no matter the time of year.

Also, even if it did make you an asshole (it doesn't), it seems like her father told you not to come anyway, so you're free on that front too."
a74i2x,"YTA.

I think you're teaching your kid a couple bad lessons here. She was happy and grateful and now you've put the idea in her head that you should care about how much money someone spent on you. That really undercuts that purpose of gift giving. Not everyone can afford to spend a lot at Christmas. Maybe that $6 gift was the best that family could do. Instead of encouraging her gratitude, you taught her to think about how much money someone has spent on your gift and that it should influence your appreciation and happiness. 

I don't think you were trying to teach her that exactly, but it's a bummer nevertheless. "
a74tyf,"NAH - but I think you need to revisit it. If there are more opportunities for the kids, maybe it’s worth considering.

Anyone who approaches kids that aggressively is a busybody just looking for something to be angry about. Don’t be embarrassed.

X surely provides you something in this relationship or you wouldn’t have been friends with him this long, no? 

Seems like perhaps over time though the exchange has become more one sided as it seems like this instance of mooch has been preceded by smaller instances. 

You’re not really an asshole, it’s maybe a bit harsh to break a friendship over this though. Think on what you get, If anything (idk), out of the friendship and burn / keep the bridge accordingly. 

I’d be pissed if I came home to my place and belongings trashed bottom line "

I get that rings are expensive. But that's why you should be really sure before you propose.

The thing is, nobody wants to be second best. And, by giving her a ring you bought for someone else, that's the message you're sending, even if you don't think that's what you're doing.

Should she break up with you over it? I dunno. It seems like a bit of an overreaction but you really did hurt her feelings."
a76avu,"NTA. Having desires are normal. Exploring those desires are also normal. But you might enter into YTA territory if during a monogamous relationship, you follow-through on those desires.

You're NTA for wanting to be included in your SO's social life, and being responsible about getting your vehicle back and arranging for someone to watch your 4 year old.

However I think this whole silent treatment thing and refusal by you to talk to her is very petty and immature by you. I understand that you're hurt by her uninviting you, but you need to communicate these feelings and why you've reacted the way you have in regards to the events as you've laid them out.

She definitely sucks for not taking more responsibility with regards to the drinking and you having your vehicle available, but I understand her lack of communication when at work/with her friends. Sometimes people are more focused on what they're doing at the time than they are with what's on their phones. I know personally I've thought I've texted people back or not checked my phone for hours at a time because I was just having a good time with my friends. It's just something that happens."

Maybe the cat is ill, which means you adopted a cat, made it comfortable for 10 months and now want to get rid of it because it’s sick. Take the cat to a vets and make sure it’s okay.

I’m sure you’ve done more annoying things than shitting outside a box and your girlfriend hasn’t gotten rid of you. Animals are innocent and they don’t deserve to be discarded over something like this. 

Also if you really do love your girlfriend, she clearly cares about this cat so if you suggest taking it to a vet and showing that you care, that may help towards her seeing a future with you. Just a tip. "

In a couple of years, you're going to look back at yourself and cringe, wondering why everything seemed so important.

You have the right to break up with her. I'm not telling you not to.

But I think you're an asshole because you're breaking up with her for being exactly what you wanted. You wanted to be her 'saviour'. You wanted her to rely on you. You wanted her to be depressed to that end. Now she is and you don't like it.

>I admit I may have made her more reliant on me than was necessary.

I feel like this is disturbingly controlling and way more telling than you intend for it to be. You made her rely on you and now you're going to leave her high and dry.

If you actually love her, help her through her depression. Counselling, medication, whatever she needs, you should help her get."
a7hu7h,"NTA, but many people might think you are when they realize you forgot their name. 

There are some good techniques out there for trying to remember peoples names. What works for me is repeating back their name twice while I shake their hand:

“Hi, I’m Jessica.”

I shake her hand and say, “Hello Jessica, nice to meet you! I’m Mark. Jessica.” And then I let go. It seems really simple, but it significantly increases my chances of remembering her name - which is easy, because without that my odds of remembering her name were zero. "

a7kstf,"YTA. I skipped over your dumbass block of text and went straight to the text conversation. You are so clearly the asshole. Don’t say “Sorry for offending you” and then give her a “Chill the fuck out” when she was telling you why it offended her. 

People have different sensibilities to these things. Your response to her should have been a “Look, I’m really sorry. It was a distasteful joke between me and some close friends that are into dark humor. I respect your tastes and your values though and you won’t hear it again from me.” I’m sure there are things you’re sensitive about that would make you mad if someone joked about them. 

I read through the block of text after reading your text convo, and you seriously come off as shitty. How entitled are you to justify a joke that wasn’t even that funny in the first place?? To call her overly-moralistic over this?? Yeesh dude, YOU are the one that needs to chill the fuck out. Granted, I take it you’re probably in middle or high school or something. You’ll eventually learn why you can’t just say whatever you want and expect people to just take the piss under the guise of “it’s just a joke bro”. But for now, you’re a huge, snarky asshole."
a7ktjs,NTA. At many turns your uncle has indicated that he wants nothing to do with the family you so cherish. I can not imagine him caring about what you do. If he does he needs to display **some** sort of behavior indicating that he does.
a7l6kx,"NAH - but be patient with your Dad, he is trying to do something nice for you. He is misguided, and possibly wasting his money, but he means well. Next time don’t tell him what you want unless that’s what you want him to buy. 

Also, sounds like your Mum is putting you in the middle, which isn’t a good idea. Don’t take this the wrong way, but maybe Mum needs to butt out."
a7l6qx,"You don’t know her reasons or what happened with her ex and the pill. Maybe they had a pregnancy scare and she’s not confident in the pill anymore. Maybe it messed up her hormones and that’s why she doesn’t want to use the pill again. The pill isn’t the best choice for everyone, she’s tried it and doesn’t want to use it again. 

This isn’t a competition about what she is willing to do for an ex vs her partner of 2 years. "
a7m6xp,"NTA. If you're doing double the work you should get double the pay honestly. You tried to help but if they still aren't grasping it 2 months in then there's a larger problem, either with them or management. "
a7m888,"INFO

It depends on the amount I think. I've socialised in poor-student-circles where hosts asked for a contribution to the party/meal. But that's just cost, like I don't think I've ever paid anyone more than like 3 euros..."
a7mb4x,"YTA. Your interaction seemed very rude. It’s hurting nobody if he prays for your family member. 

Honestly reminds me of my ex who would try to debate any old lady in a grocery store because she said “god bless you” when he sneezed. "
a7mlyd,"NTA. You weren't leading her on, you we're just trying to get to know her. Its not your fault that she isnt interesting at all."
a7mngs,"YTA a little bit. I feel like there are other solutions, like having a calculator on-hand or having someone help over her shoulder kind of deal. You put unnecessary pressure on her to improve her mental math in a week, a skill that takes months/years of practice to noticeably improve, which was the worst way of going about it. I get wanting to speed up the game, and I doubt anyone faults you for that, but you guys could have accommodated better "
a7n5zf,"What screw got missplaced in that guys head??
NTA btw you sound like a reasonable person that is willing to help out in the same fashion they helped you out. "
a7ncx7,"YTA but you weren’t malicious about it. 

Never comment on a suspected pregnancy until the woman does or until you see the baby crowning. ;-) "
a7nns4,NAH as an atheist I'd do the same and his response wasn't rude.
a7nrn7,"NAH. Not for *wanting to.* How you go about making that happen might make you one. No, you don't have a right to monopolize the only television in the common area and ask them to clear out. Even if it's only for 90 minutes"
a7o4ys,"INFO. 

It depends on wether you asked nicely or if you were a dick about it. Did you have an attitude yourself, or was it a casual remark/polite question? 

If you did not have an attitude then NTA. And of course the other lady should have helped her out. You should not even have to ask her to. "
a7o55s,"He sounds like a drama queen. Doesnt he see on the weekends how it is impossible to ""sleep when baby sleeps""? Please dont sleep on the couch unless you want to, he can find ways to accommodate you and yalls baby, ffs."
a7o5wp,"NTA. I am somewhat religious, but I dislike handing out anything other than neutral cards (if I do it at all).

Perhaps she just is receiving it as you don't want to send out cards with her. Even if you've stated differently. If you want an alternative, find some neutral cards and bring them to her to sign together.

FWIW, I don't think this is a classically Brit argument, I think it's a classic new-ish relationship argument."
a7o72y,"Come clean, its best to speak out about these things and find support from those who love you"
a7o7hz,"NAH, but he should have talked to you before booking.  You want company for traveling, he wants to see this event.  Yes, it happens every year, but next year is a long time away.  If you want to go to this event, your parents may be able to handle the bus on their own if you pick them up from the final stop."
a7ofka,NTA but I think you knew that already. You owe it to yourselves and to the seller that the work is not only completed but done correctly.

I think is the right thing to do, in the end you're going to your work to... work, not to talk with people."
a7oqtl,"This is a normal practice at my office. No one takes the contents of their lunchbox out. It’s easier to just put the whole thing in there then take it out when it’s time. That being said, perhaps there is a cultural norm or just a company policy that would contradict this. Also, in my head it seems like it would be harder to dig trough contents of multiple lunchboxes just sitting in the fridge than it would be to dig through lunch boxes. "

There's a good chance the employees knew it was their boss' Audi and just didn't want to admit it. He probably would've never came out if he hadnt seen you got an officer involved. "
a7p98a,"NTA - sounds like your boyfriend bought himself a car to tinker with, not an actual gift for you...especially since he's not ""comfortable"" with you driving it even if/when it's fixed and running. "
a7pmo9,"NTA, you’re right in thinking if you didn’t ask for it that you don’t have to pay for it. Buying drinks in that setting is a gift, not a transaction on your part. "

a7ps2g,"Easy NTA.

He should probably go to the doctor. I think he just had an aneurism."
a7q6rw,"YTA - we’ll not an asshole, but you’re not being very fair. 

You have told him to tell you & now he is telling you, but your still mad. 

He might have had reservations the first time but still want to go & then when it was going to be a financial burden he didn’t want to. 

If someone you describe as being really easy going and usually does what you want, is actually standing up to you and voicing his concern, it’s time to take it seriously. "
a7q7ck,"ESH, except the BF. Your friends specifically excluding your boyfriend of 6 years was pretty shitty. The fact it was unanimous means they likely discussed it beforehand. They then forced you to choose between him and them, which is also not cool. 

And you went along with it.

"
a7qb0v,NTA you deserve to be able to get restful sleep and not to be bothered
a7qrz5,"NTA. 

They can keep up or be left behind. 

In fact, even though you are co-workers, they are still your competition, too. "

a7rqwl,"NTA, I wouldn’t like that either.

Maybe once in a while or if they’re mutual friends, but not generally."
a7rs1l,"ESH - sewing and crochet needles are entirely different things, first of all. Like. Totally different projects and uses and sizes and looks. If you aren’t aware of at least that much, clearly you were the wrong person for the job. 

That being said, it sounds like you’re both fairly unpleasant to each other. You could probably do with some sort of conflict resolution solutions to diffuse some of your arguments. 

It doesn’t sound like your mother is clearly able to express whatever it is she’s expressing - whether it’s an idea or something she needs at the store. One way to mitigate at least that much is “cool mom, I’m happy to do that, but I don’t know what that is - can you google a picture and send it to me?”"
a7ryw6,"I'd say NTA. It is your place (or rather your parents place) and if he doesn't follow the rules it is his own fault. Also, does Susan know about Bobs plan? If not and something awkward were to happen she can't just leave since she has nowhere to go and that sucks as well."
a7s0lv,"NTA, HOWEVER, you might not know what’s going on behind closed doors. especially if she has an abusive husband. "
a7saby,"NAH, but be prepared for the relationship to end if that's your ultimatum and you're not willing to do long distance. "
a7sbg3,"YTA for the way you reacted, but yeah the guy should know basic subtraction. Especially if it's part of him job and hes been there months."
a7sci5,"NTA- tell the dude, save him the time and heartache. 
At the same time, your gf needs to cut off ties with her friend. Toxic friendships always end badly for the non-toxic one, it’s not about the time spent together, it’s about the quality of the friendship. "

a7sjvo,"NTA. It’s your home, not an hourly motel. And he should’ve known better than to have asked and put you in that awkward situation. "
a7ska5,Just have both of you take a STD test and go from there
a7sm17,"NTA it’s a private thing for you and you should only need to tell who you want, when you’re ready. You most likely told the other friends because they might more understanding of you and help you navigate all the feelings. You owe no friend anything about your life. "
a7t9fr,"NTA. It was considerate of you to do and if anything, your co-workers still working probably appreciated the move. I can’t imagine why the people you were talking to would have an issue with it."
a7tcep,"NTA. That day off is essential, caretaker fatigue is real and you would think assisted living facilities who see the breakdown of caregivers would understand that. Needing a day for yourself IS a legitimate excuse. "

a7trht,"Nta, that’s some fucked up stuff he’s accusing you of. Maybe talk to a counselor about it. "
a7trlo,"NTA 

While you may have overreacted a bit, it’s understandable when it comes to a dog that has bonded with the family. You had made it clear that you didn’t feel comfortable leaving the dog with his parents so he should’ve talked to you about it beforehand. Maybe then y’all could’ve gotten a more solid confirmation that his parents wouldn’t let the dog be out by herself? (Glad your dog is okay btw)

Also I don’t think your husband was necessarily trying to go behind your back. I always have to remind myself men think differently than us so sometimes they have no clue they did something wrong."
a7u0o4,"YTA. Complaining that someone didn't respond quickly enough on some social media site is a sign that you have taken social media a bit too far and a bit too seriously, and you might need to step back."

a7u8rg,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

I was talking to one of my old coworkers/friend about moving in with him and his girlfriend in San Jose with my girlfriend but cancelled right before I met with the rental agent for the interview. 

Background:

Friends place with his girlfriend: San Jose, rent $1275, upstairs room with loft separated and private bathroom in a duplex. 3 cats and 2 dogs, not the best area, 1 hour plus for traffic and commute, if I lose my job stuck South Bay where less options are available in tech.

Chosen option: private area in San Mateo, 20 minute commute, $1600 for master with own bathroom off kitchen area, 3 roommates, they have a rescue husky, safe neighborhood, off highway 92.

Moving in with my girlfriend and she doesn’t really pay rent or contribute to food often. She goes to school full time and is low income. Has bills and works in the after school area so she can sub in different places or work after school program. It is a long her commute if she takes highway 280 but may change jobs.

I told him I wanted to move in and then they told the other person they found so have no one. I found this option and I’d rather not do commute and now idk if they’ll have someone by Jan 1. I offered to help pay part of Jan rent if needed even though I don’t have much money. I basically didn’t want to do the commute and would rather live in a safer area. I still haven’t signed the paperwork but could maybe still go back and live with him but I hate driving and scream at people all day long. Besides that am I the asshole for bailing?

a7ubva,"YTA your grandparents are sick and in pain but all you seem to care about is them cramping your free time. 

Try to think about their situation. They have to leave their house for months and be in their grandchilds bedroom so they can be treated. They are sick and probably way too poor to afford these frequent ""vacations"".  

I'm not saying you arent allowed to be frustrated by the event but, you asked if you're an asshole for wanting them gone? Yea you kinda are. They're dying old people. One day they are not going to be around to make these visits and you will feel the void left in that absence."
a7upnj,"NTA, but only if you do it in a kind way.  Tell her that you love spending time with her, but you don't think these events are really your thing.  You've been hoping it would grow on you but it just hasn't.  Would she want to go to a different activity together?"
a7v76c,"NTA - I had lots of internet friends that had my address at one point when I was a teenager. We would write letters and send each other drawings, it was a big circle of friends.  We used to webcam chat and stuff so I was confident in their identities, but a couple of the boys I knew confessed love towards me.  While that was nice to have their affection, I was so worried that they might come to me... my parents not really knowing what an odd only child I was .

Never regretted it, but I totally feel what you're feeling."
a7v9ng,"NTA for wearing the hat but Boo fucking hoo. You went looking for trouble by wearing that hat to an NBA game. Did it feel good owning the libs?? MAGA hats are a dog whistle and show that you openly support the shittiest, most corrupt president this country has seen since Nixon. Going off your other comment history it seems like you have an unhealty fixation on president toad dick."
a7w7xq,NTA you friend is an asshole.
a7xafc,Look up the term 'Pyrrhic Victory' and see if it might just apply to you here...
a7xb3w,[deleted]
a7xrxv,"NTA I have the exact same problem, I even had my brother call me once to make sure I was heading over to moms early enough to save the turkey lol
What I do is ask her through casual conversation ahead of time what time she is putting the Turkey in the oven...and then make sure I am there to lend a hand.
Also...gravy is your friend, anyone can eat dry Turkey with enough gravy on it...always be kind"
a7y2fl,"ESH. its good to be acknowledged for a kind action, but its better to be kind for its own sake rather than for some kind of reward."
a7y59p,NTA but if i were you i'd send her a short message saying you won't be there. It will cost you nothing and one day it may be some comfort knowing your were the bigger person and didn't subject her to some petty revenge. 
a7y60q,YTA for this post. I think I got cancer trying to make sense of your story.
a7ys0v,"NTA.  If that were me, I believe that'd be the end of that friendship.  A true friend would say something like, ""I'm so sorry, I know I'm not there for you like you've been for me.  I want to be, but I am so swallowed up in my own issues right now.  I ask that you please forgive me, although I would understand if you didn't.  I'm so sorry."""
a7yt11,"NTA. She should have at least been nicer about it but it sounds like your parents are like mine and you'll probably end up giving it up anyway, hopefully not but that's just how it is. I get wanting privacy because they're a couple and whatnot but seriously, why is it needed? She plan on having sex at your parents? That's just gross and disrespectful to your parents. That's the only reason I can think they would need privacy anyways."
a7ytj4,"NTA

Do you buy gifts for your kids doctor? The postie? The person who delivers your newspapers?

At the end of the day, a teacher is another person doing their job.

Gifts would be appreciated by any one of the above along with anyone else who provides you and/or your children a service but none of them would ever expect it.

My girlfriend is a teacher. This topic has come up once or twice. Usually it's her raising the same points and saying she finds the concept of gifts to teachers nice but weird and sometimes slightly awkward. 

That's just her opinion though and if the teacher's you have think otherwise, they're probably assholes.

Don't ever feel pressured to have to compete in this regard with Mrs Brownnose because it will not affect the level of care or attention your child recieves one iota.

Nor will any decent teacher ever look down upon you for it or really, even give it a single thought."
a7ywgo,"YTA, it will definitely hurt your kids feelings seeing their stuff thrown away.
Their drawings and other projects are things they worked on and I am sure are very proud of. It seems dismissive to just chuck them, and that will lead to you receiving a lot less of those drawings. Get a special box for each kid, call it their treasure chest where you keep all the things they make.
You will also regret it later not having them. "
a7z5yl,"NTA if you’re having a conversation with her about it and expressing your concerns appropriately.

YTA if you’re telling her she can’t get it."
a7z9y9,"NTA. It’s super rude and presumptuous to expect to crash at yours. Plus his reaction to being denied make it even worse. I can understand on some level that he maybe didn’t consider it would be an issue at all and he feels close enough to you that he just assumed you’d be cool with it. But the moment you pushed back on this his response should be “oh sorry I didn’t realise it would be an issue, but you’re right I should have asked, I’ll get out of your way”, not try to squash your feelings over it like he’s entitled to your place. Rude much"
a7zcc6,NTA - he was hoping you’d give in and pay up. He had no right to fix it and charge you for it when he first said it was $60.
a7zd6l,He said he suffers from anxiety and stress too. He does not need to set himself on fire to keep other people warm. 
a7zexx,"NTA. It ain’t a fetish, its cheating. "
a7zmea,"YTA your making them think you are completely allergic when your allergy doesn't come into play most of the time (most food is cooked). Imagine if someone did that to you just because they didn't like your cooking. Wouldn't you feel bad that they didn't even tell you they didn't like your cooking but instead used an allergy to certain RAW foods as an excuse. That is, quite literally calling their food RAW."
a7zmnf,"ESH.

You and the BF suck for not being more careful and ending up responsible for a human life that you have no way to care for.

You don't suck for asking him to get a job.

He REALLY sucks for how he reacted. He sounds like a lazy, mean loser. 

Your parents and family are awesome.

You're not a bad person, you just made some shitty choices. Sounds like your baby will still have an awesome life because of your love and your family.

You should drop the loser bf. At least if he becomes a lawyer he will be able to contribute alimony in future."
a7zy34,the fact hes getting angry at you for sneezing is pathetic nta
a802v8,"It's tough to decide without seeing the place, but I'd say you're NTA in this situation.

The cafe wasn't a music venue. It's just a place to eat and socialize while enjoying some live music. The guy who was listening to the band should have asked you more politely to be quiet during that one song, since you guys weren't breaking the rules or social norms by talking."
a804iq,"NTA. Maybe sit down with 'Jim' and his buddy and explain the importance of following the rules, and tell him flat out that his refusal to play fairly is ruining it for the other players. Tell him that if he cannot handle the rules, perhaps he should try a different game, he is being an entitled asshole, and would benefit from being taught that being disabled isn't a free pass to screw things up for others. I'm sure you can say it more nicely than me, but definitely put your foot down!"
a808br,"NTA. 

Catch up with friends individually or in small groups, but spend time with your family. They miss you."
a80kfk,"NTA. 

I can see why you're conflicted, but making more money does not obligate you to provide for everyone. If they aren't close family members or friends of yours or your wife's, its perfectly reasonable you would not want to sponsor them to your family evening. If your wife is keen to host everyone, it may be worthwhile to tell her why it bothers you; maybe her family doesn't express gratitude the same way yours does.

If it's a matter of everyone wants to be together, maybe offer to host everyone but instead assign dishes: Auntie K can you bring pie, Barb & Tom bring potatoes, etc etc. That way everyone contributes and the burden isn't solely on you and your wife."
a80toh,"NTA. It’s really rude of them to exclude your wife *and sons* in that way. Especially the Christmas ornament in only your name?? Wow. 

*edited to add sons"
a80w5p,NTA
a80xdk,"YTA - because your acting like he was guilty, while saying you know he wasn’t. Your other friend can easily ignore the dm if she wants. "
a80zkj,NTA. You have to have at least one functioning parent the next day. You're not required to equally suffer along with your GF.
a812br,"NTA. That guy sounds sketchy as hell to me. His last response proves you dodged a bullet there. I guess r/niceguys would love a screenshot of that whole convo.
Also kudos for being a decent person by being straight with him."
a81dro,"NTA, hindsight is 20/20 but you could’ve said “they can live here for at most X months” and then had a strict timeline. If they actively searched and were genuinely struggling you can graciously extend that time by another hard deadline but as soon as that hits and no progress has been made get them out. "
a81k6k,"NTA- ASICS are expensive. I commend you for going back and being honest. It sucks that they are losing money, but unfortunately that’s how it works, getting the best deal. "
a81kkm,"NTA

BUT! You are being very sensitive (which is understandable), when it doesn't sound to me that she is trying to be mean or whatever

As for this Christmas, do NOT adress the issue. I know you feel line you have and want to vent out all the pain and anger you have, but she is only a small part of it, and she still is your husband's mother. Give her a bit of a cold shoulder and that'll be enough. No need to confront on what is supposed to be a happy time of the year"
a81zbt,"YTA, you should give them pizza too"
a8224y,"YTA for taking the money and then calling anyway.

By taking the money that was the end of it. You decided the 200 was enough to not get insurance involved.

You would not have been the asshole to call the insurance company which is what you should always do. Maybe he should lose his job so he learns to be more careful. You should also learn that when you take a payment as an end to something like this you need to stick to that. "
a822ym,[deleted]
a823g9,[deleted]
a82736,"NTA. It sounds like it was a very thoughtful gift. It also sounds like your wife wasn't going to appreciate any gift. Maybe try a spa day instead? It's the best I can come up with. Either way, you're not the asshole, because you had reasons to back up this specific gift as being a good one."
a82fdg,"NAH

Once something is gifted to you, it’s yours to do as you wish with it.

That said, I can understand she’d be hurt if after giving you a nice/expensive gift, you tell her you’re giving it to someone you both don’t care for"
a82r9m,"YTA, it’s none of your business whether or not the kids are adopted.  It comes off as offensive that you assume that they are adopted since they have a darker complexion than their mother. "
a82v1g,"NTA is my gut reaction... but maybe detail how exactly you asked her to calm it down?

calling you mean, fat, and jealous just seems like a BIT much of a reaction, when you were kinda looking out for her, since messing around with married/commited folks can get nasty. "
a83rni,NTA it seems like he is favoring her family over you. A man who does not care of his family is hardly a man at all. He should have communicated and thought about you when making these huge decisions. Sorry about how things are going.
a83rp3,NTA. Your life doesn’t stop because a friend is getting married. 
a83sy4,"NTA as you didn’t mean any harm but you always have to be careful in describing someone’s baby. Rightfully, they are very sensitive. "
a840ya,"NTA

The cats need to go if she’s not going to live up to the original agreement.

"
a8424a,"NTA he might not be able to see it, at the end of the day it’s high school it doesn’t matter. He does seem pretty overly dramatic/sad you have the full right to choose how and with who ur going to spend ur time with. You were actually very nice about it considering he ignored you and such. You didn’t do nothing wrong. Good luck"
a8429y,"NTA. First of all sorry for your loss. Everyone grieves differently however. It depends on the person and your relationship to them. An elderly father that you knew would pass is less of a shock, and you have more time to prepare for it. I lost my grandmother the day she was discharged from the hospital, and it was brutal. I lost my grandpa after he hung on for a week, and I wasn’t as bad. Nobody should judge how you grieve because everyone grieves differently."
a849k0,"if you considered him your boyfriend (pass me the term, i know it has serious/committed connotations) then no, NTA. if you were asking him out because deep down he looks enough of a girl to you that you’d feel like you were dating a girl, then you’d be the asshole. i think it’s that simple. "
a84btq,I'm not even gonna read this. NTA. Absolutely NTA. This ain't about anyone but those kids and you fucking did the right thing. 
a84o1w,"ESH man why did you not have your cat desexed? That would have stopped you from being put in this position and is a part of responsible pet ownership. Do not keep the kittens as it looks like they'll have kittens, then those kittens will have kitten and you will be the absolute craziest cat people ever living with one thousand cats. (This does actually happen to people,especially to people who seem a bit hoarder-ish...)"
a84tw3,"SHP

You recorded two people making plans to ruin a man's life with a false accusation.  I can't think of any conceivable way you can look back at that and actually ask yourself ""Am I being an asshole right now?"""
a84xaa,"NTA. If you don't feel comfortable calling her grandma, don't, especially when she seemed to have earned that right. There are ways to be (distantly) respectful without playing into her desire to be seen as the perfect, doting grandma or otherwise feeding her narcissism (assuming I'm getting an accurate read of her). Maybe see if being addressed as ""Step-grandmother Margaret"" is more to her liking."
a8576b,"NAH: Having been on both sides of this issue, there’s not always an easy answer. One one side, speaking your native language with your family just happens naturally. You often don’t even think about it. On the other side, it is often seen as impolite, especially when everybody understands English. So I’d say you’re justified in feeling uncomfortable. "
a85grj,"NTA. You asked him to pick you up something cheap, he refused. He then rocks up with a premium bottle and shares it around. He didn't buy that for you. He bought it for himself so he could pretend he was the big man on campus and he thought he could stick you with the bill. Tell him to fuck off."

a85x7t,"NAH, you're just inexperienced.  

If your hair is black it will take a few bleaching sessions to get to the right lightness. You have to bleach in sessions often a month or two apart to give the hair time to rest. Hence the 6-8 weeks comment. She probably only toned it because toner is how people cancel out those brassy and greeny colors. And, if you're going for a light color and planning to bleach soon toner is usually the best option.  

I always dyed my own hair and I once went to the salon for a bleach job and I was horrified at how gross they toned my hair. Buy some purple shampoo and wash it a few times it should help with the excess toner and neutralize some of the green and orange in your hair."
a860fy,"NTA, but I want to add that they did give you a gift: they taught you that they are a bunch of envious jerks, and when you get out of there for good, you never have to think about them again. That's worth a lot more than an Amazon card or some BS scented candle. "

They don't want to be your study buddy.  They just want you to do well. Some types of things get you flustered when studying for an exam.  Its not your fault.  Your dad knows you love him and you want him there for other things -- fun things.  Tell him it's time to go and good luck on finals."

They may be supporting you in ways that aren't immediately clear (such as paying for things that you'll need)"
a86lhy,"NAH as long as you're not being an asshole to your friend. 

I get that you're jealous and you wish that it was you going on this trip, but you're good as long as you don't act like an asshole towards her."
