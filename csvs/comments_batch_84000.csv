e30jpk,NTA- You have a duty to protect the kids. Period. At the end of the day you gave her a choice and she made that choice. I feel for her family but you have to take care of the kids and they deserve a sober mom.
e30js3,"YTA - It sounds like you’ve already played it for any friends who would “benefit.” The funeral where his family is getting closure would not be an appropriate repeat. 

You also mentioned depression and perhaps his state of mind when he created it versus how he may have felt later are different. You can’t prove how he would feel today but you do know how his family would feel. Err on the side of caution and don’t play it."
e30t90,"YTA because youdiscussed her going with you if you go, and now you're going andyou don't want to take her with you because you just don't want her there? So it's not even about the ride, it's about you not wanting her at the store she sells art at. So if she gets there through other means (an actual friend, public transport,...) you'll still be upset?"
e30ts6,"**YTA**. Christmas is not always about giving gifts and expecting something in return. Also, how dare you punish your niece and nephew just because their parents are not giving you something in return. 

However, I would need some more **INFO** about your niece and nephew's ages, because it would make a huge difference."
e30tvt,"NTA - you and your boyfriend have plans to visit your family. He goes back on your plans to ask if he can see his family instead. He gets upset because you let your parents know that his plans had changed. 

Your boyfriend is immature and needs to make up his mind"
e30u1y,"There isn't a magical rule that says that children aren't allowed in first class, it's just that few parents can afford to do so. I suspect that it was a new situation for everyone involved.

NTA, but expect death stares in the future."
e30ueh,"Nta

But you should talk to the rest of them about why. They might be just as sick of him."
e30uou,"I’m sorry but I’d have to say YTA for denying her the process to heal, you didn’t want to be with her and lied about it. Yeah it would of hurt but she would of had a chance to get over it and fled the pain instead of months later relapsing you’re lying and still feeling bad about it"
e30w31,NTA - especially considering all the circumstances I think it’s only right that you’re pre-warned before his arrival. I know I’d be scared personally
e31521,"NTA. If someone is consistently rude or hurtful to you as an adult you can choose not to see them, I can't see why this would be any different at 16. 

Say to your Mum 'I am not going because..' and leave it at that. It's up to her what she says to your aunt, but it's not really your concern."
e31i0i,"NTA. Sometimes it’s hard for people to notice if they’re having issues with personal hygiene— like BO or stinky breath. I think he’d rather hear it from a friend than from a stranger, and as long as you’re kind and not pushy about it."
e31jzy,"You should carry uninsured/underinsured coverage on your car. This means in the event there is a collision, YOU are covered.

He is an unsafe driver! He doesn't have insurance! What were you *thinking?* Of COURSE you should have reported it! Luckily no one was injured, but what about next time? My God man, he SHOULD NOT BE OPERATING A MOTOR VEHICLE!

If I get downvoted for this, ok, but an unsafe, uninsured driver is a risk to EVERYONE on the road. 

YTA"
e31mrk,"NAH

Whoever is missing their package will more than likely take steps to get a replacement or refund. 

You don’t need them and donating them is an excellent option."
e31nos,"NAH. There is nothing wrong with saying, “hey I love you, but I don’t have the energy or funds do to this round trip every weekend.” And he’s not an asshole for wanting to see you. Explain why you want to lessen the frequency of trips with care, and truly listen to how he feels about it as well. I do think you can meet in the middle though. Maybe you can keep making these weekly trips but he can pick up a part-time job to help you pay for gas? Or actually, physically, meet somewhere in the middle for an inexpensive date once or twice a weekend? 

On a side note, seriously do not try to stay in another student’s dorm long-term. If he school found out (which would be pretty likely in that kind of a living situation), your boyfriend could be in big trouble."
e31pya,"NTA, you should report the incident to HR"
e31sho,NAH  Your aunt asked for help and you said no.  You are an adult and she doesn't have to invite you to her house for Thanksgiving or any other day and you don't have to split wood for her.  You want thanksgiving without helping out then make your own or go out to eat.
e31srv,NTA he can listen to music in kitchen or back yard or head phones
e31szf,"NAH- but Ross, is that you? But seriously, if it’s not a huge sum of money, I’d just participate and earn some goodwill."
e31xkv,"This is a lot of info but a really simple answer. You’re NTA for the exact reasons you list. She’s a stranger to everybody. She could be a dude for all anybody knows. You’re sweet to care so much about dad’s online life. Keep it up, he needs it. Sheesh. And congratulations on your baby."
e3205a,NTA. You *have* got your priorities straight and she is not number 1 ( not should she be). She'll just have to get used to that.
e322f9,Whoever designed ring 2 is actually TA.  That thing is appalling.
e323mb,Tbf it's good you went back you shouldnt leave extra food for dogs while you're away I guess it wasnt loads as you didnt expect to be away for days at a time but cats can moderate themselves dogs dont always tend to do that.
e324jz,"NTA. 
My cat also yells at me when I don’t let him inside right away. He has an excuse though, like not having thumbs or a pocket to keep a key. What’s your roommate’s excuse?"
e325op,Nta. Just because a parent choose a new partner doesn’t mean you have to deal with ‘em.
e328u0,NAH- you'd been behaving strangely and you had her pills in your drawer...that's the natural conclusion to come to. And addicts aren't the most honest about their drug use. They freaked out and that's only natural when you have a history of depression that they would think you could be self-medicating. You have the right to be upset but you can see why they thought you would.
e3297d,"NTA, do it. Controlling abusive people need to be taken down a notch"
e32jvq,"NTA

She'll get over it when she needs you to do her an unreasonable favor again. :) Trust me."
e32k33,"NTA. That's a pretty significant fever, and there's a good chance the others may have caught it and just aren't experiencing symptoms yet. Holidays are all about sharing, but not when it comes to illnesses lol."
e32num,NTA Entirely reasonable to watch your cats weight.
e32plb,"ESH.

Is it too late for Jane to beg Jolene not to take her man?"
e32q3u,"YTA - I was struggling with this one because I know you were trying to do the right thing by being honest, but you knew he was grounded and you let him go and then you told on him - that wasn't right. You either should have said ""no"" or let him go and kept it between the two of you. Now you're stuck in the middle :("
e32x09,"NAH except for your mom.

It is not your wife of her family's fault that your mom changed plans at the last minute. You should have honored the plans that were already in place."
e32ynd,"YTA - Sometimes it takes time to process the sharpness of insults because of the adrenaline in the moment.  Laughter is a common reaction to being uncomfortable and doesn't always mean everything is okay.

What you said was disrespectful."
e32yvk,"NTA. It’s not your job to support your friends lifestyle. It sounds like you have an unspoken arrangement, so it’s time to tactfully revisit said arrangement; ie “I’m trying to cut back,” “Funds are a little low,” “I’ll buy specifically for you next time I’m home, but I’m going to need the cash up front.”"
e330b3,"I kinda lean towards YTA. You keep saying for them to “get a room” well they have one and they are using it. And jolly well good for them. Telling them that they shouldn’t have sex when you are home is wrong. You could have just said “ Hey look, the walls are a little thin in this house. My room is right next to your room.”
 I get it’s weird for you OP but honestly your parents being so into each other is kinda endearing to me. And good for them.
 Also, your dad is right, you were disrespectful. You don’t get to dictate to them if you get another sibling.

Edit: spelling."
e331a9,"NTA. The idea that you, an intern, one of the lowest paid person in the company (if you get paid at all), should use your money to buy something for one of the higher paid people in the company is profoundly stupid. Not only should YOU not get your boss a gift, none of the interns should."
e331op,[deleted]
e3348o,NTA. She agrees then lies for an extended period of time before revealing you cant do it your way and your unable to cancel and now must pay for pictures you didnt agree to. Shows she had little respect in that situation.
e337x1,"NTA, you're right to stand up against a bigot, even and especially among your own. But INFO, does the rest of your family share her opinion?"
e33d0s,"NTA...except why did you let your girlfriend put a FOUR YEAR OLD in timeout for an hour and a half? That’s absolutely insane.

Update to OPs Update:  I hope there’s a timeframe attached to this new arrangement.  What if she never feels better about it?  I think that’s a bad call.   Glad you’re going to look into grief therapy though."
e33dr9,"NTA - if you hadn't put that money into the house whose to say of your mother would have had it?

Your siblings will disagree, but just because you are ""somewhat well off"" it does not mean you should be losing out"
e33nw1,"YTA. It's still a very personal experience, even if someone doesn't keep it shrouded in secrecy. The fact that she advocates for reproductive rights isn't ""bragging,"" it's advocating. 

The fact that she's proud of the fact that she has reproductive rights and was able to exercise them is also not ""bragging."" It's *exercising the reproductive rights that she's proud and fortunate to have*.

Like damn. That's not something for you to share with other people."
e33nx8,"esh and you should stand up for yourself instead of missing out on all the food. You already did everything, you might as well enjoy the good part.  For Christmas, say no to cleaning- it’s simple"
e33qnf,"YTA. She should be going to a therapist or the psych ward if you’re that concerned, not a church. Seriously? Especially if she’s not religious previously."
e33rrm,"NTA your wedding your rules, but be prepared for the fact she might not want to come."
e33svb,"YTA

having him bail on his pre-planned family visit would make him a bigger asshole (to them) than he would be by 'bailing' on you to stick to the plan"
e33uul,"NAH about the dream.  Good to use the  energy in a way you and wife enjoyed.  

Y T A, in my opinion  for letting your friend in on the secret."
e33wzn,"Holy crap NTA. You would be TA if you didn’t. A lot of times women don’t feel comfortable or safe speaking up, especially when it’s someone in a position of power. Not everyone is capable of it, or has been conditioned not to. It’s our responsibility as people to stand up for each other."
e33x5h,"NTA. If she’s not in the photos AT ALL, you don’t have to take them down."
e3402q,"NTA, its not like you are even living there, and you are 26, you are supposed to make a living and create a life for yourself not clean up after your mothers misstakes"
e3424n,"YTA

Consideration is consideration... Do you really have to be told to walk slower to stay by her? Honestly.

INFO: what do you gain by walking faster than her?"
e343p1,NTA She wants to be the center of attention. I had an employee that used to crochet during meetings. At first it bothered me but she got all info needed and remembered better than I did most of the time. Go forth and crochet!
e345ja,"NTA. You're partner is 100% the asshole, especially since you always spend holidays with his family."
e3473i,"This might be controversial...but at 4 months old most babies look the same and are not easily identified. This might just be my opinion but pictures of me at 4 months old, I would not be able to look at it and know it was me. Obviously I would know what MY baby looks like in a lineup of a million babies but I wouldn't be able to pick YOUR baby out, especially if I met your child when they were 10+. So I'm going to go with NAH because it is your baby therefore your choice. But I do think you may be overthinking it a little."
e347hj,[deleted]
e34971,"NTA. It’s common to pay more if you have a bigger room/better room than everyone else. In the house I lived in with my roommates we all paid different amounts based on room size, and especially with having an own bathroom it’s very reasonable!"
e34b1z,"Going against the grain to say YWBTA.  No matter what the mom's mental illnesses and struggles may be, it is inappropriate for you to clean her house without permission.  Now don't get me wrong, I don't think that what you've described is right or healthy, but kicking in someone's door, going through their things, and changing them around is not okay.  Your choice in the matter is not what the state of someone else's home is, it is whether or not you want to stay there at all - if I were you, I wouldn't agree to it."
e34fae,"NTA, he’s a huge part of your life and you shouldn’t have to pretend he doesn’t exist if it comes up organically"
e34hle,"You may have to ask for help or even assign help (eg: you do the turkey, hubby does some sides, etc)... or you may have to have a holiday blow up and go on strike.

We normally host, and we work out in advance which guests are coming and what they’re bringing. I’ll do the main (smoked turkey, ham, whatever) and others will do the sides. 

No single person should have to do everything.

NTA."
e34mmb,"NAH, but it's probably best to accept them and then replace them when they break, which can happen as soon as you'd like."
e34nch,"While I believe you are in the right here....it strikes me if you follow through it's one of those many, little ways that a couple kills all the love out of a marriage."
e34q9e,"I don't think you'll be an asshole, but I also don't think it's a good idea.  I'd talk to the host parents before confronting the host sister.  Something tells me that she will NOT take it well if you do."
e34s2d,"A tip, separate paragraphs for easier reading.

Nta. You don't have to go. Also I would tell your parents because they should know."
e34tb8,"NTA, but ask yourself, are you his gf or his mum?"
e34tt1,"NTA. Your sister needs to grow up. First she should not assume  she is entitled to your stuff based on her or anyone's analysis of your current degree of use of stuff. This sounds like a preteen spat over last years toy. Second as your sister she really should not befriend your ex-husband out of respect for your feelings, especially immediately after divorce. Third if she does befriend your ex-husband she should sure as sh*t realize that he cannot speak for your stuff. And the ex is having boundary issues, and hasn't fully understood the meaning of ""ex"""
e34wis,"NAH but you should make it up to her somehow. Not your fault your dogs got sick and I’m guessing she doesn’t hold it against you, but yah, it did kinda mess up thanksgiving so maybe invite her over to dinner at some point or send her a bottle of wine with a pic of your dog and a card that says “sorry we are a bird and you didn’t” :)"
e34ybi,"NTA. 

Your mom is breaking your family apart. She chose to marry and have kids with a man she wasn’t in love with, and in doing so she risked the happiness of her husband and her children. There’s no excuse for that, whether she was still in the closet or not. 

She cheated on your dad, and your dad is a more devoted parent than she is. Go with your gut."
e353lk,"Majorly YTA

>I don't think it's his role to meddle in this 

If it's not his role to meddle, why is it his role to buy the cigarettes?"
e356go,"NTA - it's your dog and you taught it in a way that was convenient to you. If the signals are easy to pick up, then it's not really a problem as you can show anyone who needs to the signs. Why would random strangers be commanding your dog anyway?"
e359k8,"NTA. Your father is an asshole, excluding a kid from a fucking wedding is literally pointless."
e35arx,"So you are in one line, your gf is in a line, and your wife is in a line? 🤔"
e35c06,"NAH 

holy high school, Batman"
e35dvy,"NTA. I cannot believe you let yourself get railroaded into a day you didn't want in the first place. It's YOUR special day, not your families. They were totally out of order and you absolutely deserve to have a beautiful day. Get it booked!"
e35iec,"NTA

A hypothetical offer of eggs made a few years ago to a third party is not a firm offer made in current circumstances to the person who needs the eggs. Your previous possible willingness, if it was brought up at all without you there, should have been presented as a possibility to follow up, not as something you'd promised last week. They did not have the right to commit you to that hypothetical willingness.

Even if you did make an actual offer years ago, it's now. You can change your mind for many reasons. Yes, that change might upset people, but it's your right to decide whether and to whom you donate eggs."
e35l3b,"If this is true, NTA. Your GF is a massive asshole for putting your kink out on social media."
e35muj,"YTA and it may be illegal. Your aunt works for that person under the assumption of trust. Rich people are extremely cautious about their privacy. You violated their privacy and effed with the trusted relationship between your aunt and her employer.

Did you take the video down?

Also, thinking that just cuz everyone on reddit does it, doesnt mean that it's legal. There are hundreds of illegal videos on Reddit.

Further, you have NO idea what was identifiable. What if they had one-of-a-kinds? That's a great way to identify stuff. What if they had stuff that was precious yet highly stealable?

**An OUNCE of common sense** woulda helped you in this situation."
e35vik,"YTA

You expected everyone else to wait 40 minutes and eat what you admit was “cold dinner.”

Perhaps you should host if you don’t want to travel?

I have been the one stuck hosting holidays for many years.  If someone is not there when dinner is served, they get leftovers.  That’s how it is."
e35w6k,"Obviously NTA. The gf is manipulative and has probably convinced your friend of going her way, against you. You're just being a good friend imo"
e35ygw,[deleted]
e35z0g,I’m gonna say NTA it’s your kid. You get to decide who kisses your kid and who doesn’t. He shouldn’t have let her kiss your kid especially with how nasty you say she is.
e35z0y,"NAH.  Tell him that you’re concerned for his health.  If need be, offer to show him the relevant information."
e3612b,"NTA but your mum and dad are.  Why in the name of god would your mother defer to your father's decision?  They're not married any more, you and her had a financial plan organised and you don't need any input from him.  She needs to shiny up her spine and make decisions for herself. It has nothing whatsoever to do with him. 

Your father sounds like a. A-grade arsehole. She's well rid of him. And no,  you're not TA for cutting him out of your life."
e361wp,"NTA but honestly it's easier to identify people with behaviour you disagree with and ignore/avoid them... than it is to lecture them into some sort of change. You don't get to dictate her social etiquette, but you can stay clear of her if she doesn't meet your standard. You might have pressed the issue more than necessary.

One time I was driving around with a friend who threw a can out if my window into the lawn of a business we stopped near. I insisted she get out and pick it up. Unacceptable! I concede that I wasn't being nice. 

Maybe our actions had an impact but, as I've gotten older, I now consider it a waste of time to try and impact the casual friend in this way."
e361yr,"NTA
You can and should share this information. Now your coworker has leverage to get a raise that she probably deserves."
e361z7,"I think this isn’t really about the gifts fully. You say you’re parents don’t care as much about your daughter as they do about your son, and that makes them assholes.  Idk how you’d go about trying to bridge the gap and get to the bottom of why they don’t seem to care but I think it might be important to do so before daughter gets older and starts to feel a cold shoulder from them.

NTA"
e362qa,YTA.  There is no way this is going to damage your car.  Cars are constantly used with uneven weight distribution.  My husband weighs 215ish pounds and constantly drives around by himself.  Those weight limits are very likely to be EXTREMELY conservative.
e363j0,NTA. Innocent kids don’t have anything to do with their parents mistakes. WTF is wrong with your family??
e366d0,"YTA, this is a completely valid arrangement that the person with the biggest room pays more."
e368w8,"NTA, not sure why he's trying to guilt trip you into not going"
e36dlq,">*""I told her she dishonored our agreement""*

For goodness' sake.


Surely this is a shitpost? Nobody **REALLY** interacts with the person they love and want to share life with, in these sorts of terms?


If this story is true, YTA."
e36f3j,"NTA. Dude, your folks sound possessive and crazy af."
e36g9a,NTA. Knowingly letting people eat recalled food is unprofessional and unnecessarily lazy. You aren’t wrong to refuse to work somewhere that would do something like that.
e36g9v,"NTA. If you really have asked that many times and it is never going to stop, you kinda either be her maid or do what you're doing. I'd do the same"
e36s03,NTA he could've informed you earlier to cancel of they had been a bit sick for the last couple of days.
e36tax,"NTA for one reason- the kid’s mom said NO, so why in the world would it be okay now for the child to use someone else’s phone?"
e36ukk,ESH if for no reason than I wasted ten seconds reading this trivial junior high garbage
e36uly,"I think giving a dog away for free can be risky if you dont know the person - they could be used as a bait dog for dog fighting or something. A person willing to pay for a dog is more likely to treat it well imo. That should be your reasoning behind a price, not wanting the money. 
NTA in this instance, but don't get another animal until you are willing to commit to it for its life."
e36xp6,"NAH - whilst you’re not the arsehole for asking him to push the button, I can understand his annoyance. If you would have justified your asking him to do it by saying something like “oh sorry I thought this was my floor, can you press ground floor for me please” any anger from him would have been less justified

However the use of just the term “ground floor please” sounds on the surface of it like there is some expectance of him to press the button for you, and he probably interpreted it as an entitled demand, rather than a polite request. IMO, just a misinterpretation of the situation"
e36xsf,NAH. It’s doubtful that kids that age are really going to notice that they received fewer gifts - they’re just going to be excited about the ones they do receive.
e36z7g,YTA for texting something like this at the last minute. Cancelling on family on a holiday should at least be done through a telephone call so you can explain what’s going on thoroughly.
e371fa,"Yta, keep drama off the internet and stuff. General rule of thumb, not just because you’re making stuff public, inviting people not involved to get involved, but also putting things out there you might not be able to take back because they’re documented"
e376qu,NTA - She shared it so she should have expected some shape or form of a response and you told her the truth. It seems like a bad situation so you told her.
e377z9,"NTA. The child is 2. He is altogether too young to be exposed to the dismembering and evisceration of an animal. It is a scary, messy, bloody thing that no child needs to see until they are old enough to understand that meat is animals and aren’t afraid of the sight of blood or sharp implements."
e37aau,"NTA

Do your parents realize how much drama having Jacob and his father there could cause? Asking someone else to use their social function as a way to try and force a reconciliation is unbelievably inappropriate. Tell your parents that it's a bad idea to do this for a lot of reasons. If they really want to insert themselves in this other family's drama, then they can invite them over at some other time and not risk them blowing up your annual holiday party."
e37age,"ESH 

You reneged on your promise. They didn't get (everything) you asked for. Doesn't everything have tổ be shipped into alaska? I thought supplies were relatively limited unless you order with the next shipment"
e37ayf,"NAH

As a parent of a sixteen year old, I worry when my kid gets hurt. I probably wouldn’t have gotten the neighbor involved, but I would have said that if your eye looked worse the next day, you’d be going to the doctor. You’re at the age where you’re wanting a level of independence, and I get that, but your mom wants to make sure you’re not injured too badly."
e37bnx,"YTA, sorry.  When your boss at work is sick do you still expect a paycheck?  Yes, you do.  Just like your sitter should be paid even if you're sick.  She's providing an agreed upon service and has bills to pay, even if you're sick.  You're an employer, not a relative, not a friend."
e37eub,nobody wants to hear shit like that in a time of panicking/being frantic/the last minute. joking or not i wouldn’t have said it lol. but of course she was panicking so of course her reaction could vary. torn between a very soft yta and NAH
e37kq4,"NAH

Tell your brother the entire truth, that your son doesn't want a relationship with him, and you lied because you thought he would come around. 

Hopefully, he will forgive you and understand how his nephew feels. I know it seems likely he will still be angry, but at least he has the truth."
e37ml1,"NTA - Its a family ""relic""(???) putting in a young childs room puts it at huge risk."
e37v3m,"NTA.

Used TVs sell for *a fraction* of their retail price. You wouldn’t have gotten a lot of money for it anyway."
e37v3g,"NTA, but it sounds like it was a bad idea to move out there. You don't mention your bf standing up for you, so I'm going to assume he doesn't. If you stay in this relationship you can expect to deal with this everytime you interact with his parents. Get out now."
e37xy5,"YTA

Your younger daughter needs to be assessed IMMEDIATELY. It's not normal nor typical to have these reactions to things like the dark or heights. That being said, there is no way she needed both of you. If you have conditioned her to expect EVERY TIME SHE IS UPSET mummy and daddy drop EVERYTHING to comfort her, that's just poor parenting. At 6, she should be self-soothing. You need a new therapist, yesterday! 

I am so upset for your eldest daughter. You have done her a serious injustice and it's obvious you favor your younger daughter over her. You are being unfair, and you don't even recognize it. Get your younger daughter an assessment, and a new therapist. 

Apologize to your eldest daughter. Do better."
e383uh,"YTA.  

> fiancée is upset because I proposed in public, even though a couple months back she mentioned how that would give her pressure & anxiety.

Like.. duh."
e3869q,YTA.   Your grandma and aunt are only looking out for your best interests.   Not sure why that offends you.   Sounds like you need someone to be looking out since your mom isn’t holding you accountable for your success in school.
e3879h,NAH. You’re broken up - you are no longer obligated to communicate with him for any reason.

e38t9u,"NTA, if your mom isn’t capable of watching him by herself, HIS mom needs to take responsibility of her own offspring.   Also., They are the assholes for trying to make your dad stay home with him."
e38wwk,"NTA, your partner’s family shouldn’t be treating you like that, and it’s completely reasonable to not want to visit with people that make “jokes” at your expense and treat you like shit for being better educated than them."

You are not ""technically the reason"" for his speeding. He made the choice to take you to the airport, show up late, and speed. 

He's the a-hole for expecting that you would pay his ticket though."
e39enu,"ESH. While he was wrong for saying all those things, if your brother was truly one of your closest friends you shouldnt have gave him shit over a pack of gum and some snacks. Me and my siblings never act like this"
e39inp,"Giving them money won’t do anything, they’ve proven to have very poor money management skills. The fact that they’re staying in a motel instead of renting a small apartment (which would be a ton cheaper) is a huge red flag.

1) you sounds super dismissive of your wife, like you think she’s stupid and you’re high and mighty. you want to get rid of the help so “she’ll do something” but you shouldn’t be delegating, you’re not in charge of her.

2) if she is not contributing, you have every right to be frustrated, and things need to change. she’s being lazy and you are totally justified in what you expect from her.

e3apzb,"NTA. It sounds like this woman has made little to no effort to develop a relationship with you, so why would you feel a familial connection with her? I think you should talk to your dad and tell him how you feel--that your stepmom doesn't seem to have mad much of an effort to actually connect with you other than yelling or getting mad, and it's made you feel conflicted. Even say you would be open to more of a relationship with her (if you are), but if this woman has lived with you for FIVE years and made this little effort, it doesn't sound like she really cares. But people can always change. Also, I do think it's reasonable to tell your dad that it makes you very uncomfortable to be in the same room as your stepmom while she dances, and say you'd prefer to leave the room if she ever engages in that.

Something like buying tickets to a show you know they want to see and offering to go together? Or those cheesy fake coupons for babysitting or a day trip to the beach? Might need to brainstorm on that a bit, but I think it'd go a long way to try to replace ""gifting"" with some other thoughtful gesture so they know it's not a matter of you being lazy or not caring."

Instead of framing it as better for both of you, have an honest conversation about your own feelings.  And give her an opportunity to tell you how she feels.

Secondly, you've made your daughter's tuition dependant on C accepting her apology. As the fees are something between you and your daughter that's not appropriate especially as C seems to be the issue here.

Your niece is very aware of her loss. Her classmates have parents, but she doesn’t. She made herself vulnerable and asked to call you Mom. It would be a gift, not only to her, but to the memory of your sister. You can’t replace her, obviously, but you can take up the helm of raising her daughter like she would have.

In the three times it took you to say “watch the tea” louder and louder, you could have walked over and moved your child away.

Just because they’re family does NOT mean you have to be kind if they’re not extending the same courtesy. I can’t imagine that shunning is doing wonders for your mental health either, and it’s in no way your responsibility to gift them anything. 

If you want to try and keep in friendly contact with the kids, I understand wanting to buy them presents, but you’re also saving up to start a family (congrats by the way!) which is much more important IMO. You can always try to explain the situation to the kids when they’re older if you want a relationship with them, but unfortunately I don’t see your brother changing anytime soon and wouldn’t waste another dollar on him. It may be a little awkward if you come around with no gifts, but it’s awkward your brother put you in this position in the first place. 

So in conclusion, you wouldn’t be the asshole if you didn’t buy them gifts, but if it makes you feel better you can. I hope the situation gets better and have a great Christmas regardless.

e3m6g1,"NTA and I’m appalled by the amount of “don’t snitch” in this comments section 

Downvote me to hell, but smoking is an awful habit. It destroys your body and causes all kinds if health issues, plus it’s nasty. Cigarette butts are the most littered item in the world, ash trays stink, it makes your breath nasty, and second hand smoke is carcinogenic (it causes cancer). Furthermore, as a teenager, your brother is also stunting his growth and doing damage to his brain. He’s hurting himself. If he continues to smoke and picks up this habit, he cuts years off of his life and does quite a bit of damage to others because of secondhand smoke. Nicotine also does a pretty substantial amount of damage to developing brains. 

And that’s not mentioning that he lied to you, and broke the deal you had arranged. If he cannot meet the terms of his deal, then said deal shouldn’t be fulfilled. He smoked. That’s his fault and you’re NTA at all if you tell. You even gave him a 2nd chance. 

It’s good for your brother because it might make him stop and it illustrates that actions have consequences. 

But, seeing as I’ve got a brother, it feels obligatory to say you need to sit him down and have a real heart to heart about how nasty that stuff is and how badly it’s hurting him. Make it very clear he does not get another chance. Put the ball in his court and see if he fouls again. Not quite as extreme as telling on him and might accomplish everything without the blow up. 

Best of luck."

Nothing wrong here at all. He's being open and honest about his feelings.

>So I told him to stay in his lane.

Your boyfriend (1) expressed how he feels about this, open and honestly, and (2) acknowledged he cannot and should not tell you what to do in spite of his discomfort.

asking once is fine. but when you’re told the restaurant’s rules you should know that you’re putting your server in a very uncomfortable position by asking them to beg their bosses to break the established rules"
e3ogyf,"Nah, YTA the whole story is phony. 

1. Costco membership cards don’t have two names on them. Memberships can have two members but each member gets their own card with name and photo. You are not allowed to use someone else’s card. There are also age requirements to be a Costco member and if you want to be a membership co-signer you have to have the same street address of the main cardholder. So they came in with their dad’s membership card and no personal ID. Cashier did their job and nothing more.

2. When asked “why didn’t you talk to a manager” The OP said “there was no time to talk to the manager  between arguing with the cashier and getting kicked out by security.”  But then also says “mom was paying cash had no id or drivers license.” and “the cashier just ignored us.” So it wasn’t an argument, more like the two were just yelling at the cashier for doing their job because they had no valid id. And instead of talking to a manager, which would’ve been pointless since they have no id, they chose to sit there and yell at the cashier, who didn’t even engage them, until security came and took them outside.

The story changes from the cashier being abusive to the mom and the son yelling at the cashier for doing their job. If the mom had Id she could’ve gone to member services and gotten another membership card printed up. She shouldve gone home and gotten her ID.

The lesson here is that it takes a lot for fucking Costco security to throw you out. You have to do something to earn that kind of treatment."

Their bodies won’t process the water like that. They’ll need to pee around midnight from the water you have them a few hours before bed. You’re better off if you cut off water several hours BEFORE bed because they won’t have any waste to build up. If they sleep at eight, last cup of water should be at 5 with last chance to pee right before bed. Otherwise they’ll pee. But why are you letting them sleep in your bed if this is such an issue for you? Either they wear pull ups or they don’t sleep in your bed until they can sleep the night through without an accident. 

You let them push you around until you snapped. That’s on you and your lack of boundaries. The minute they started playing with the water, you should have taken it away. Same with the gummies. You let them make you angry until you snap, and because they know you won’t do anything they keep acting like that. You are, right now, the kind of person who would raise an awful terror of a child. Of course they don’t respect someone who lets them do whatever they want."

e3sw8n,NTA. You’re an adult and your first priority needs to be your partner and your son. You don’t have to feel guilty not extending an invitation to your home to someone who treats you all poorly. At some point there needs to be a conversation that you will no longer put up with his treatment of your partner.
e3sxtc,NTA. Your ex needs to be held accountable for paying child support for his child. Do what you need to do to ensure you get the money. He knows he owes it and is purposely screwing around to keep it from you.
e3t93k,"NAH. I think a lot of people are going to call you the asshole for calling him stupid. That wasn’t great and I think you know that. But I don’t think that tips you into asshole territory, I think it makes you human. I get that you feel frustrated because you think he should fight and that there is something worth fighting for, but if he is also dealing with depression he just might not have it in him. 

I deal with both chronic pain and major depression and I just don’t have the words to describe to someone who hasn’t had the experience the grinding ordeal that the day to day becomes. You are just so fucking tired and fucking *bored* by your own pain. I can completely understand how he could want to usher in a resolution to his glaucoma, just to be done with it.

 I know this isn’t what you want for him and I don’t blame you for feeling hurt. But he’s fucking tired and it’s his choice to make. You need to let him make it. There’s a peace that comes with accepting your fate. I’d advise you to look for that."

Snitching on him for having his phone out. Some might say that's a bit too far but honestly I would have done the same.

And then his friends yelled at you and stamped on your bag AND emptied it out? Yikes what the fuck, that isn't okay.

What you said was a bit extreme and there was no need to bring his weight into it, but considering their actions, I would say it's totally justified."

e3uaem,"NTA because I honestly do not understand why she would cry over you asking a pretty normal question.

e3vevj,NTA. You absolutely did the right thing. Some dogs just aren't meant to be around other animals or children and it sounds like Coco was one of them. There's nothing you can do about that but accept it. The breeder should have warned you about the possible temperament issues. I urge you to report them. Thank you for thinking of your sweet older dog and his comfort first. You sound like a wonderful pet owner who just got saddled with an animal they couldn't control.

e3viht,"Dude, more than just the Christmas tree, I am REALLY concerned about your budget here. How far above your means are you living that you make 150 THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR, and you can’t afford a $95 Christmas tree? You already have a tree and I think it was shitty your wife tried to guilt you by talking to your kid about it, so NTA there, but how are you referring to yourself as a “deadbeat” whose $5,000 vacation wiped them out, when you are making THAT MUCH MONEY. That is absolutely insane and I really think there’s a lot going on here besides just a tree."
e3vkd2,"NTA. This is really cold, but why would she think ""Her own family"" is the children of the woman who her husband was married to when she met him? Aka her husband's family who she never raised or much interacted with? 

Abandonment by definition requires an initial presence (you can't abandon someone you never knew). NTA. Unfortunate, but your father and his wife are the aholes here. 

Your father was wrong to tell his daughter you were coming to visit and never once ask you to come until it was almost too late."

03:00am is a pretty shitty time to be 'whispering' in the living room, that noise can carry through a quiet house and be very annoying.

He shouldn't be acting like a child and blame and guilt trip you for an argument he had with his wife, that's just pretty low,"
e3vty3,"NTA. I do it to my b/f all the time, as he will often do with me. Neither of us take offense at all. Sounds like he had issues with it because he felt like it was challenging him. Glad he’s your ex now, sounds like a jerk."
e3vusb,"NTA obvious favouritism if you ask me. Your stepfather left a note for you so therefore, it should he yours. Simple as that. Aldo, about the part about you stealing the name, your son was born 3 months ago, she was pregnant after that. You didn't steal the name."
e3vv09,"NTA, you warned them many times and they refuse to listen AND they dumped work on you def not the a-hole"
e3w2is,"NTA

She has the etiquette backwards. The person familiar with the group has the responsibility of introductions and staying close to the partner. 

Moreover, they also have the duty of providing the time limit to be spent. 

While you should check in equally from time to time, it’s not very much obligated. 

Also, it sounds like the minor “celebrities” are jealous that she has an independent partner. 

Sounds like she cares too much about outside opinions. And if she spent the entire time talking about you behind your back, then she doesn’t respect you."
e3w437,"NTA for storming out. You should have gotten the heads up. However, will you still get a good reference from him? Doubtful. He was most likely worried that you would take intellectual property with you and he wanted to protect that, but he went about it in a really shitty way."
e3wbqw,"NTA because damn. 'You could've done it just to be nice' sounds like guilt tripping, and he admitted it himself that it wasn't much so why make such a big deal out of it?

Communication is always a difficult thing to get right because people understand and react differently to everything. But if you apologised for how you phrased it and tried to explain yourself properly, and he was still fairly aggressive about the situation (which was a few unwashed dishes; why such a big response?) then he is the one with an issue here.

It's one of those situations where it may be just a small thing, but it's all about the lack of respect for you. Not massive disrespect, but the fact he's getting upset to that point, even after you tried making amends, just feels disproportionate.

I also get he was getting up super early to leave, but getting that mad about it just feels mean. All that was needed was a 'sorry, I thought you could do them in the morning because I needed to sleep' or something. It feels like immense guilt tripping.

I hope you feel better, and that the two of you can sort everything out."
e3wftk,NTA. you were upfront with her after you discovered her lie. she is definitely TA here.

e3wx1f,NTA she could be in serious physical trouble and needs to see a doctor.
e3xady,"NAH. This just seems like a normal chink in an otherwise good friendship. It seems to me that your friend might not understand that you are being truthful when you tell him you can’t hang out for the reasons you give. He probably thinks that you are giving excuses. But you have the right to say no to something if you don’t want to or if you can’t. 
I would try to talk it out next time you see one another in person. Explain to him that you aren’t lying and that you value his friendship, and he will eventually come around."
e3xbku,"YTA.

>The issue is that I see my child once a week now. We are close but I can tell he doesn’t really need me.

Do you really believe that? I know children in this situation, and they never stop wishing their parents would love them more. By the time your child is old enough to ""come live with you if he chooses,"" he'll choose not to, because he'll have worked out that he was never a priority for you.

If you want to improve your life, do it, but don't do it overseas."
e3xfd4,"NTA. It’s fine that he wants to hang with his friends and he should be allowed to do that, but leaving you alone for so long when you’re uncomfortable isn’t right. He can balance the two, spend some time with pals and some time with you. 

I feel like it’s just a case of men being emotionally unavailable, rather than him necessarily being an asshole. As your partner he should consider your feelings and wellbeing"
e3xi4i,"If your girlfriend's sweat is staining the sheets that badly after walking home from work, she needs a doctor not a shower."
e3xr7j,NTA you are not obligated to give people free rides...especially when they’re being assholes
e3xsd3,NTA. Find better friends. These people are rubbish.
e3xsu6,"So, I can see where you were coming from with this. 

Here’s my issue with execution, though. 

By your own admission, your employees got their asses kicked. 

When you told your employees what was happening and why, I doubt that they were feeling enlightened, educated, or more open minded. Most likely they were feeling resentful. Towards you, and towards the people they were already discriminating against. 

Under the assumption you weren’t just doing it to make them suffer something they’d only view as a punishment, and honestly wanted them to interface better with customers, NTA. I just think there could have been a better way to go around it. Like you said, they’re still pissed a week later."
e3xu1b,"It’s his xbox, you don’t have a right to it. YTA. Now maybe if you were gonna ask him nicely, maybe even offer to do something for him, he would give you the pin no problem. However allowing your parents to punish your brother for not giving the pin means he’s not gonna want to let you play at all. You don’t respect your brother or his property clearly."
e3xxti,"NTA, he's the parent and you're the child (albeit an older teen), he ought to be taking the initiative to make the plan."
e3y081,"Dude, she probably is having a PTSD-like response to this pregnancy  from her past experiences with two miscarriages. Her response to the trip isnt a matter of rationality or logic. She's scared.

You accept that shit wholeheartedly, and even play that CD on blast on the home stereo system. You are grateful that she tried. You shut up, sell the PSU, pony up the difference for the one you want, and get on with your life. 

Don’t fuck with Grandma."
e3ybu9,NTA. How old is she?
e3yg19,"NTA. He didn't put much effort into raising you without bullying, and you're still trying to keep the peace by getting him a gift. You don't have anything to worry about."
e3yild,NTA you have every right to be uncomfortable about this. Just be calm when you approach this as it seems as though she doesn’t have many friends.
e3ylre,This isn't really a matter for AITA. This is deep deep territory that you need to be discussing with a therapist or a priest or a family psych.
e3ypz5,"NAH Although as a general rule it is to be assumed 230am is much too late to be texting anyone but as you say you 'saw' him online it is not entirely your fault.

Hes not wrong for being upset with you waking him and now has made it clear he doesnt want texts that late."
e3yr5z,"ESH. You don’t buy something for one child and nothing for the other, but you need to realize PDQ that your kid isn’t better than your nephew. She may be smart, but if she’s being mean and nasty and calling names, you certainly haven’t taught her to be kind."
e3yssy,"NTA

Thought this was you proposing right before he did.

If all she was yapping about was how you showed him all the options, then she must be real insecure. All you did was help a friend and even told him to ask his GF on stuff, but he refused cause he wanted the surprise factor.

She is probably salty you are closer to him than she is or something."
e3z6jm,"ESH

Unless you actually know that she is disruptive or doesn't pay attention you don't really have a right to judge her. Everyone learns in different ways and different teachers will inspire students differently. She can absolutely have the opinion that the teachers aren't very good if they are failing to engage her or take her needs as a student into account.

The appropriate response to make would have been ""oh you didn't like them? I've had them both and found them to be very good teachers""

She also sounds like she was being narrow-minded and judgemental. Texting you later and telling you that you need to rethink what you said seems petty."
e3zjd6,"NTA in fact, I'm surprised you didnt take everything out of your name.

If you havent done that with the utilities yet, I highly suggest you do that immediately.  If you don't live there then NOTHING in that place should be in your name now."
e3zl7a,"NAH, assuming your mom is looking out for your best interests and isn't just complaining about the hour. That said, I'd suggest carefully examining your outings and ensuring that they aren't affecting your grades, your health, etc, and that you aren't doing anything that'd get you in legal trouble."

If your parents want a big wedding, let them throw one for themselves."
e3zvxe,NTA. I do think you should have made it clear what you were taking so they had a chance to replace it but threatening you is way over the top.
e4029t,"NTA

But it depends on how you are 'correcting' their mistakes. If you're just pointing out every time they are wrong and being overly critical, that's kind of assholish, but if you're being helpful and showing them better ways to do it, and of course also making sure to explain to them why you are doing it, then you're not TA."
e404p5,"NTA. Your money, your decision. That said, I'd suggest a long talk with grandma and grandpa to make sure it's what they truly want, make sure it won't leave you destitute, and make sure they'll be cared for back in Vietnam."
e40bu1,ESH she should be more mindful and respectful of time.  You sound overbearing and patronizing.
e40iet,"Eh, close call, but I'll go with YTA. Your house, your rules, but it sounds like it wasn't your house. Thus, while it may have been more respectful to avoid the topic, it sounds like you threw a tantrum because the others disagreed with your positions."
e40r82,i don't think she's planning on getting the abortion dude
e40sw2,"YTA. It would have also been inconsiderate to ignore the phone. When you’re traveling with other people, sometimes you have to be inconvenienced. Making plans for the morning was important. If you didn’t want to do that, you should have made plans last night and let everyone know you were sleeping in"
e40xng,"NTA, just be sure you don't fall afoul of squatters rights where you live"
e416cd,"NTA. Your husband is purposefully doing his chores badly trying to get you so exhausted with him that you'll do them yourself. He also sounds very abusive with his words, which I am very sorry about. Is this a man you want to keep? Appreciation for what, exactly? Berating you?"
e41fyw,"NTA. The system was a gift of yours. You were kind enough to let your siblings use it. Your sister abused that by taking your game system to college without permission, and she has no right to get pissy about you putting your foot down and not allowing that to happen again."
e41j8k,YTA if you hide them and disrespect her wishes.  Talk to her and explain the situation and that you will be more careful than the previous tenant.
e41jv5,"YTA because you promised your friend a ride and aren’t coming through. I understand not wanting to upset your mom, but still, leaving your friend with no ride is shitty."
e41lb8,NTA. You are not required to be tolerant of intolerance. If your sister's orientation is that offensive to him that he can't put it aside for an evening with his family then he *should* stay away.
e41mcv,"Mate, you've been in seven car accidents and are still recovering from the last one... and your husband *still* doesn't realize that your anxiety isn't a commentary on his driving skills? NTA but maybe get couples therapy if you aren't already. This kind of thing would mess anyone up, and if the therapist can get your husband to realize that this is not and never has been about him, all the better."
e41n1u,"NAH. Tell him. Writing is hard, but you're right, you don't get anything if you don't try."
e41wqa,"NTA, any boss who expects someone to be happy 100% of the time while doing their job is unrealistic."
e422z3,"ESH... Unnecessary drama from all of you. You made a wrong assumption between you, you could have knocked gently on the door or something to see if she was up... Your sister was annoyed, and overreacted a bit for sure, thinking there was more to the situation than there is... But your rant at the end shows you to be anything but nonchalant when it comes to your sister, and is also a massive overreaction.

I assume there's a lot of history to this though, in wider terms I don't know who the asshole is, as there's definitely difficulties in your relationship with your sister... But in isolation, in the end it's just breakfast, and you and your sister are both making a massive deal out of it."
e42eqw,"NTA- I’ll never get why people say the opposite for these posts. I would want to know if it were me. If I were you, I would cut him out of my life for good though."
e42h6b,"YTA

That sounds frustrating. My husband is always whining when I lose stuff, but he loses things, too. I am sure you lose things every once in a while. So the language that is ""has"" to be her is wrong. It's *probably* her, or *most likely* her, but saying it is 100% her and you never misplace anything IS ABSURD. I am sure you make mistakes, too.

She should be more considerate of your things, but come on, it took you a minute to find your nail clippers? And you ""have to call her phone?"" Come on. That's your wife. Be nice."
e42jt9,NTA. I think family & business doesn’t work. I would just get up that share of the rent & move on from this situation because it’s not working out as it should.
e42t3x,"NTA your dad says he doesn't care, so you shouldn't. If he manages to fall asleep in each movie I can't believe that he's too invested. He likely just comes along to keep you company.

Don't listen to these strangers, both your parents were chill about you giving up the ticket for your friend."
e42vdk,"YTA.

Your brother told you that you pout when you don't get your way. Now you are on Reddit literally pouting. He went to your parents for support and you are mad they ""talked behind your back."" He is just trying to communicate his feelings in a delicate way. The original argument is pretty silly - he was trying to share something he loves (music) with you, and you got mad because it wasn't what you wanted. Half the music you want and half the music he wants sounds very reasonable.

ETA. You already have three specific examples. 1) the incident with your mom jabbing 2) the music 3) pouting on Reddit now."
e42ykn,"NTA

HIS family expects cards? Great, he can send them."
e435nq,Where is the interpersonal conflict?
e4383l,"NAH. She was trying to lighten the mood. She sounds like a caring woman, and you are obviously on edge. 

Let it go. Take some comfort from your wife. Life will go on. 

So sorry for your loss."
e438ni,"NTA, the ""blood is thicker than water"" excuse is bullshit. You shouldn't have to deal with a toxic person just because you're related. SIL sounds like a pathological liar. How does your wife feel about this though? Is she supportive of your decision to not associate with her sister?"
e43940,"NTA - maybe there is a self esteem thing there as you probably know but no, that doesn’t make you an asshole.  But...why the heck did your friend react like that and tell people who are now mad at you for it?  That’s an ahole move!"
e43cs8,"NTA: friends should be able to reality-check each other. I’d maybe ease it in a little though. Ask her to be realistic— when was her last modeling gig? Maybe even spin it such that having a higher paying job might actually afford her a couple of sessions with high profile photographers and give her room to invest/work her way out of Instagram-basic? 

She’s eventually gotta realize that pretty doesn’t last forever. But all you can do is lead her to it, and the kick in the ass has to come from her. If not, it’ll come from some other extreme outside force and it’s is going to suck even more."
e43dqt,"3 adults and none of you gets more food? 

ESH. But the little sister."
e43exa,"NTA - I wouldn't order the ""sad"" burger either."

e43i77,"YTA if you expect her to carry another kid when she’s like 50. But otherwise, no, I don’t think so. It’s normal to miss children and miss when they’re young. They’re so sweet, and innocent.

e44smw,"So... heres the fun news about in-kind donations.

Here's how it goes.

1. I donate a sofa to goodwill.
2. Goodwill gives me a receipt. It says: thanks for donating a sofa.
3. I forego the standard deduction on my taxes. I catalog my in-kind donation, using receipts. None of the receipts I have for in-kind donations will have a valuation on it (they used to but not any more). When I catalog my in-kinds for tax purpose, \*I\* am responsible for providing a valuation of the donation. (See #3 in the section about what a donation receipt is required to have:  [https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/create-a-501c3-tax-compliant-donation-receipt/](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/create-a-501c3-tax-compliant-donation-receipt/) ). 
4. Lets say I get audited as a result. I will have to have photos to prove the valuation I ascribed to my in-kind donations.

All that to say, its really not JUST a matter of getting a receipt. If your aunt wants the tax savings, she needs to do the work.

e44u42,"NTA You were clear and honest with her and she ignored you, that's something she needs to work on, not your fault. Honestly gifts should be something you give because you want to and can, not because you feel obligated or because you expect something in return. Also the fact that she keeps bragging about how much money she spent on your gift is really distasteful and of putting. It's pretty weird."
e44x86,"NTA. Also if I were to do it on FB, I’d post something on HIS profile not her photo. She just wants likes and comments..."
e44ycu,"NTA. you had absolutely no relationship
with this man and your step siblings even said you didnt have to be there. im sorry they didnt wish you a happy birthday, but i think you’re reading too much into that, they probably have bigger things on their mind."
e453ai,"Hugs help when the person hugging you respects your boundaries. If they don't respect them, then yell at you while showing you a bs article they certainly don't. They should add that disclaimer lol.
Jokes aside, NTA"
e454o1,"Yeah, no harm in setting up some boundaries to make a toxic relationship less toxic. Congrats on coming out.

NTA"
e455fi,NAH imo. It was a surprise gift I'm assuming and you didn't expect it. He was being nice and trying to help you but a phone is something you'll have for a few years before you get a new one so you should be happy with it. I think you should thank him for it but explain why it isn't practical for you
e45c3y,"If you don't want to hear people, you need to move. 
If the noise is bothering you, but even you admit it isn't excessive, then maybe YOU need to look at soundproofing solutions. 

Sometimes, it's not the other party that's the problem, and here it sounds like they are simply living there, which you can't fault them for."
e45csv,"NTA - it sounds like Joe wanted you there but only if it was convenient for him. You had planned on him picking you up, he bails because he doesn’t want to deal with traffic. I am assuming like any other mode of public transportation it would be money out of your pocket for something you weren’t all to invested in."
e45fam,"NTA as I bet they are aware it’s your space and that it’s residential parking.

However, it’s asking for trouble and I would’ve just let it go for tonight and I think your BF is being petty and causing trouble for the mistake he’s made, so he’s probably TA here too."
e45gsg,NTA. He knows you'll clean up after messes he makes *while he makes them*. Don't let him piss on your leg and tell you it's raining.
e45gu2,"NTA. It’s yours to send wherever you want, whenever you want, for any reason you want. Middle bro sounds entitled and like his priorities are outta whack."
e45h7r,NTA to meter your own emotional output. Sometimes things are just above your paygrade.
e45hlo,"NAH - I’m sure your boyfriend is upset that he let you down. But shit like anxiety doesn’t really care about other people’s feelings. Anxiety is one of those things where it can physically make you sick and I am sure that’s why he wanted you to take him back home. 

And while it sucks that he couldn’t make it, this is a thing that he needs to work on and get help for.

Talk to him. Maybe even make dinner together at his house. Have a nice relaxing evening."
e45i8x,No one is ever an asshole “in a good way”.  Your SO sounds toxic and you should slowly remove yourself from him.
e45j6m,"NTA

As far as I can tell (not knowing typical US semester dates) you gave them about 9 months notice of your intention to move? That is plenty of time for them to make alternative arrangements. And by the sounds of it your continued living situation was just assumed on their part, rather than based on actual discussions, so it isn't even like you went back on your word. *And* you've said you'll help find them a new person. You're fine mate."
e45m1g,She probably wakes you up doing all the stuff moms do to make children like you comfortable. YTA and a brat for even thinking this makes good sense.
e45n12,"YTA if you go see your grandparents at all. They sound awful and like they are emotionally abusing your aunt with cancer. Even if it's a religious thing, they're still giant assholes and so are people who hand wave or excuse that behavior."
e45orh,NTA. It was your food. She should’ve asked.
e45qax,I think YTA for not taking your husbands feelings into consideration. You both created this child and so he should have a say in what the name should be and you guys could come to a compromise.
e45r92,NTA — not your responsibility. You offered him help and it wasn’t what he wanted. He has no right to be pissy with you. You didn’t have to answer his phone call at all on Thanksgiving. You could’ve had it off the whole day to spend with family.
e45rq4,"YTA, she can't make everyone a bridesmaid. Be thankful you don't have to spend time or money on it."
e45ug9,Info - if you knew going into it they'd be gone through the end of December why won't you leave now?
e45w39,"NTA. Fuck that guy. Save those kids.

Do be careful though, this woman might harbor ill will towards your mother, and she might act on it, and you will be the one who gave her the information."
e45x75,"NTA. You have every right to choose your own makeup, and it was bizarre and controlling of your mom to try to take that control away from you in such a public confrontation. Is your mom this overbearing in other ways too?"
e45xpz,"YTA.

>He told me that it wasn’t really my place to say, and that he was bisexual and not gay. I kinda shrugged and told him that they were basically the same and he got upset and told me that he was going to bed.

This is the thing. It's not your place to say. You're making decisions for him and that makes you TA."
e45z1k,""" I didn’t go because I wasn’t personally asked to come ""

I was going to say N-A-H, but after this ""clarification"" from you, YTA.  You knew you were invited, but because someone didn't beg you to come, you decided to make a statement and not come. Who knows, maybe more ""friends"" will just decide to do the same thing as they see you being an ass about it. 

It would be different if you HONESTLY did not think you were invited.

I am guessing there were other friends that showed up to the party without a formal invitation either."
e462ep,"NTA, at all. Your current husband needs to work on himself, because that’s a pretty gross thing to make you feel guilty about. It’s not like you’re harbouring feelings for an ex; he died. You’re allowed to miss him and grieve him and want to remember him. 

That said, approach current hubs with love. Try to understand his feelings and let him know you care about him, but you don’t feel comfortable hiding your late husband or his life. Conflict resolution should be about finding a true solution, not winning a fight. Good luck!"
e464nr,NTA- tell them now before this becomes a habit.
e469ns,"For the record, NTA and I think everyone calling you petty is being absurd. Your ex puts in no effort during the year but wants you to just hand over your son on Christmas? Parenting is all the shit that happens between New Year's and Xmas....

That being said, your son is old enough to make the decision and if you discuss it with him without making him feel guilty or like he's the bad guy, I think no matter his decision it would be a win for you."
e46fdg,NAH - You stopped when you realized you were being creepy
e46kz5,The freemasons....run girl....run.
e46m4y,"NTA - But it seems like maybe it could've been handled better. It's okay to want some things to be just for you, and it's also okay to want your boyfriend to respect that.

The 5 year old is just the same, but they're still learning so it's something that has to be taught, just like all manners"
e46q88,"When I opened this, I thought it was going to be a picture of *you* and him, and I was like, yeah, he should probably change that, it's telling people you're still together. But your dog? I mean. I don't know if it makes you an asshole or not, but it does seem pretty childish.

I'd say yeah, YTA. You weren't just to ask, that's fine, but he said no, with good reason, and to keep pushing himself about it, yeah. Just move on."
e46x7k,Tell them together?
e477i2,What about an ultimatum? You will remove her from the class u less mom agrees to stay in another room.
e47ig3,Is this a real post?  Over 55 cents? YTA for this post.
e47ilw,"NTA though in the future, it would probably be more fair to remind the kids who aren’t doing the work they agreed to do that they aren’t meeting expectations and if they don’t pick it up, they won’t be getting paid."
e47mll,Yta. Why does it matter and why did you feel the need to point it out not having ever met the kid?
e47n3o,"NTA for merely asking, but YWBTA for demanding it. You have no jurisdiction over who your mutual friends associate."
e47xe9,"NTA, they're keeping the deposit, your paths have diverged, it is what it is"
e47xr5,"NTA

You barely get any PTO in the whole year and their expectations are not reasonable."
e4803u,"ESH. Shoplifters obviously suck, but you did behave unprofessionally and deserved to be reprimanded at the very least."
e4817e,NTA. I’m sorry this happened to you. You deserve friends who will be honest with you and he refuses to do that.
e482ug,"YTA

You were sneaking around their home while everyone else was together and expecting you to be there. This is a huge violation of social norms and you are the asshole for that.

If you don't agree with the social norms, don't participate. I'm with you on gift opening. But please - don't act like opening gifts is so morally repugnant that you physically cannot be in the same room and needed to go somewhere else. In someone else's home. Without asking them. It's just not respectful and it's really weird behaviour."
e4840y,"NTA. Your friend is taking advantage at this point. Your mom wants him out, it’s your job to tell him that."

e485wq,"NTA. This roommate is a gigantic asshole. If you’re paying rent, you get access to common spaces whenever you want - not when the guy sleeping on the couch allows it."
e488on,NTA - - Your friend is the asshole for telling her about your conversation with him. He should have done this on his own without you telling him. I hope your sister eventually realizes you did this because you love her.
e489s6,"I see no harm in bringing them, but I would ask the friend first if they mind if you knitted during the hangout.  NAH, necessarily."
e489yn,"NTA.  Sounds like your mom is toxic and you avoiding her is best for you.  All OK NTA for exploding, people can only take so much constant criticism."
e48aem,NTA. Every kid needs an adult in their life that they can go to with things like this. It’s awesome that your nephew has you to fill that role.
e48ez2,"NTA - but don't hold it against the cousin.

Talk to your parents about requesting your aunt repay for the damaged brushes and wasted paint."
e48gev,"NTA, but the best course is to leave her alone. I understand the hurt that can come from thinking someone was a good friend, only to find out that they didn't care about you as much as you do them. Also, establishing boundaries (which it sounds like you were doing by being more assertive) tends to weed out people who don't respect your boundaries. It hurts like hell, but overall you're better in the long run to not have people like this in your life.

Edit: I misread and thought it was HER wedding at first. It's understandable that you might not be invited to her sister's wedding, even if she wanted to invite you. With the per person costs, wedding lists can get cut throat, so I wouldn't hold it against your friend that you weren't invited. The fact that she said ""leave me alone "" still makes me think that you should, in fact, leave her alone. But if you are missing her and your friendship still after a few weeks or months, I think it would be acceptable to check back in with her."
e48lj9,"NTA you’re not stopping him from chasing his goals, you’re just not willing to give up your own, which is totally fair! A steady job, a car, and a degree are all very important and realistic things to want for yourself. Don’t let him bully you into leaving"
e48max,"NTA Everyone expressed interest in the meat-related pizzas and ""agreed"" to the cheese ones. Then they ate the only pizza you could eat and did not apologize for not leaving you a slice. If they want cheese pizza, they should order cheese pizza."
e48mq8,"NTA. You have an obligation to tell your friend things like this - you have no obligation to this acquaintance. If you don’t want people finding out you’ve done shady shit, don’t do shady shit."
e48nf3,NAH. Part of being a parent is teaching kids the tough lessons they need to know in order to relate to others and be kind. You did the right thing.
e48nhz,NTA. That’s gross. I hope he was at least sleeping on a sheet on the couch.
e48oe3,"YWBTA. If she's as bad as you describe, she will take any humiliation you put on her, multiply it by 100, and inflict it on your brother as revenge. 

PS, this is a good example of why ""I don't sugarcoat things, I tell it like it is"" people are like 2-year-olds in their ethical and emotional intelligence. Good for you for asking for advice though."
e48p9m,"oooooh lady I was on your side until you started using sex as leverage. Use your words and work through the issue; don’t punish people for not giving in to what you want. 

ESH."
e48qr8,NTA. There’s no point in her spending a ton of money on furniture that you don’t like and will most likely end up putting on Craigslist or donating
e48vq1,"Rule8. A Gala, really a Gala that he ""had to go"", really ? And a hat for graduation how old is he, maybe your shitpost should say prom."
e490vl,"NAH - this is pretty par for the course given the boundaries you agreed to. If you don’t like it, you need to say something"
e491wd,NTA. Don’t light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. Never let anyone make you feel guilty for prioritizing your own well being and eliminating the toxic from your life.
e493nx,NTA.  Your wife is an enabler and her brother desperately needs to learn how to be an adult with adult responsibilities.  Sometimes that means being forced to figure things out the hard way.
e494tc,YTA. It’s not yours until you pay for it. As a cashier I’ve seen things go wrong with credit cards and cash registers. What happens if something gets screwed up and you can’t pay for it? You’ve just stolen that item. And you’re teaching your kids to do the same. As a mom I always had snacks in my bag.  Let your kids eat/drink things you’ve already bought.
e49aiw,[removed]
e49b4y,NTA. No need to attend and be uncomfortable in the presence of people who don't even like you or want you there. You can always visit your bio mom at her grave if you want.
e49c0g,Ehh NAH.  She was doing it by accident obviously.  She can’t control what she does while asleep.  But at the same time I don’t blame you for doing what you can to mitigate her uncontrollable response.
e49wxi,"**You are NTA.** It should have been the guy's responsibility to ask you questions about the behavior of the cats before adopting them from you. It is also not your responsibility to take the cats from these owners as you have signed off your ownership of them. These man and woman are also both wrong for suggesting to put down healthy cats. I don't know what country you are in but in the U.S., animal abuse is against the law and punishable for jail time and heavy fines."
e49ybl,"YTA. Your uncle gave you a job and hired your friends I assume based off of your recommendation. When you left for another job and took them with, you were leaving him SOL. He tried to be civil to you, for the sake of your relationship. Quitting left him in even worse shape because he was hugely understaffed and had no one to train the two new hires. He’s your family and he did right by you by hiring you all in the first place, the least you could have done was leave at your notice date."
e49yif,NTA. That flatmate is a total dick though. Also...u might want to keep an eye on him around ur gf. That whole scene was dodgy asf.
e4a3al,ABSOLUTELY NTA - And here’s why. I hear it a lot especially on my small inbred city. I’m constantly asked to move for families though my SO and are childless and intend to stay that way. The way I see it is that their poor planning is not my issue. Period. But families constantly run late and expect others to accommodate them. Nah. Not happening.
e4aa3y,"NTA. I feel you should wear what makes you comfortable, irrespective of the event."
e4abf5,"ESH and NAH

You got rid of something he cared about because it was creepy to you 

He kept a dead fucking lizard corpse for four years."

e4aucc,"I mean you sure sound like YTA. She’s seven. Take a bite, say something dumb like “yum, i’m full right now but this is amazing!” and send her on her way. Not hard."
e4axj0,"Your absence isn’t causing them pain, it is causing them GUILT, which is completely deserved it sounds like. And it isn’t your job to fix their guilt."
e4b91f,"NAH and I think it's a lovely idea. It's called a ""plus one"" because it's you plus one person of your choosing. I think especially since your friends know and like your mom it's completely fine. If you're worried whether it might be a problem for your friends (I doubt it or they'd have let you know in the invitation) you can just ask them, but really I think it should be fine. It's not like she's a random acquaintance or something. It really should be all good. I hope you and your mom have fun!"
e4bf5a,"NTA: This just makes me sad, and I would consider dropping these “friends” over this. 

Have they done anything like this to you before? Did anything happen during the planning process that would have inclined them to blow you off?"
e4bhlg,"You are N T A for buying a more expensive gift for your bf than his family members. BUT

e4bo1z,"I'm going to say YTA. Not because you are having a baby and have chosen to be stay at home parent, but because you don't seem to understand how not using your degree could upset your parents. I'm sure they made some major sacrifices to provide for your tuition, room & board, and spending money.  Maybe you will use your degree for employment later, but the longer you go without using it the less it will help you land a job. Hopefully your marriage works out and you won't need to support yourself financially. If it doesn't you will understand why many people postpone starting a family to get their careers started."
e4boa2,"NAH, but you may want to consider seeing a therapist."
e4brdy,Info: Are these ideas and projects expected from your typical work? Currently sounds like you want acknowledgement for just doing your job.
e4brnp,education is more important than a dead-end job
e4bwkp,"NTA. Your sister needs to knock it off. She has no business critiquing your home or cleaning it. Tell her that if she doesn’t stop, she’ll no longer be allowed in your home."
e4bzxv,"Damn, reading this post makes me feel soooo old.

ESH. Don't unfriend her, because I bet you'll make up in a couple months and you'll end up adding her again."
e4c21d,"NAH. This isn’t being dishonest. If you don’t need to turn your heat on, you’d be silly to do so."
e4c83s,"NAH. It sounds like just a really unfortunate miscommunication? Would you feel comfortable with not backtracking exactly, but rather just making it a positive thing? Like “now you know i want to marry you! But you can still totally propose to me!” 
Either way, he’s not wrong for wanting to propose to you and you weren’t wrong for proposing to him."
e4cay0,"NTA

It is your hair. 

But I do hope you're dying it for more reasons than ""Everyone at school had been asking me to"""
e4ccu7,"Controversial YTA 

You are a college student, which sounds like you don't live at home any more. It isn't your cat. The rest of your family got a cat and will continue to care for it. You are bonding with it while it is still a kitten and imprinting that it prefers your room while your siblings who will be around more are by default limited in interacting with it. You can't both ""set up spots for it"" and just pretend it just prefers your room. 

And you know what? It could be your siblings want to spend time with you and the kitten is a pretense. It's definitely a break, so you are entitled to spend it any where you like. Rent a b&b away from your family and do you work by yourself. Or you could have stayed on campus. You are grown up. But you decided no, I'll go home for thanksgiving. Your family has a reasonable expectation that you will spend time with them, especially the younger ones. But it's definitely assholic to be snippity with your EIGHT YEAR OLD SISTER who wants to play with a kitten and talk her older college age sister's ear off while you stay at her home! My two pence."
e4cd4y,Info: why can't you go by yourself or with friends without him?
e4cf39,NTA. It’s bad enough that he used your belongings without asking but he also went into your private space to retrieve the item and then lied about it.
e4ch76,NTA. You're dealing with immense pressure and you're young. Your feelings about your mother are valid and you're allowed to speak them.
e4cj00,YTA You're lacking the very basics of social media etiquette. You ask before you post other people's images. People don't have to ask you not to post them.
e4cnn3,ESH- ya'll are fucked up. Probably not a good idea to get married.
e4cs6z,"NTA it's your choice to have people in your life and if you don't want them in it then you don't have to. I have a very very messed up family and only talk to 1 aunt and a couple of my cousins and siblings. I am no contact with the rest of them and it makes my life so much better.

e4d1h3,Nta. You didn't feel comfortable and they made homophobic jokes IN FRONT OF SOMEONE WHO IS GAY.
e4d4bs,"YTA. Did you not realize that the messages refresh everywhere when new ones come in or go out? Also, it sounds as if you’re trying to make it sound like she purposefully snooped through your messages and just happened to see it. What probably happened is she saw the message from your coworker come in (because, ya know, you didn’t close the window) and then automatically saw your reply. That doesn’t quite qualify as snooping through your messages."
e4d6q0,"NTA. If your mom wants an invite, she needs to discuss that with your dad. It isn’t fair to ask you to get in the middle."
e4dbj2,"NTA. It doesn't make sense to assign the smaller bedroom to two children and the bigger bedroom to one child. Your parents are being unreasonable, but their house their rules I guess."

e4dvcs,"NTA.  I feel like people are using anxiety as a way to cover for themselves to do really rude things.  I’m not  suggesting anxiety isn’t real, not at all.   I have anxiety and that shit is a shitty mcturd. 

But using my anxiety as an excuse for bad behavior is wrong.  She should have communicated her state of mind/feelings during the trip.  

*but she can’t cause she has anxiety*

No.  It’s not an excuse.  For anyone dealing with anxiety I’m gonna be mad clear.  If we keep our experience to ourselves and then blame the world around us for not helping/“catering” to us we are wrong.  How the fuck anyone will know we’re going through something?

*but I don’t like confrontation*

Telling someone something isn’t negative.  Confronting something only means facing it.  If you *don’t* face it the problem usually evolves into something worse.  

So this friend was wrong.  All she had to do was pull you to the side and say the week was overwhelming.  You and your fam could have adjusted things for her.   If she still wanted to go home you’d have a heads up.  

Guys I’m all about self care, boundaries, putting myself first and respecting my mental health but I won’t use my mental health as an excuse for rudeness.   NTA."

e4ehc8,"NAH

You aren’t an asshole, you’re just a teenage girl. And being a teenage girl can be rough. I know it doesn’t feel this way, but fifteen is so young. Your looks are going to change over the next few years, as are the tastes of the boys around you. 

Focus on the things that make you feel good about yourself — both your looks and your other gifts. Are you really good at one subject or activity? Are you really funny or a great friend? Everyone has things they are good at. Lean into those things.

Instead of telling your parents you want plastic surgery, maybe talk to your mom about less drastic things you can do to help you feel better about how you look (different haircut? family walks after dinner? more of your favorite shirt?).

The better you feel about yourself the more relaxed and attractive you will be.

Also, wear sunscreen."
e4emk0,"NAH. You are rightly feeling protective of your wife and it upsets you to see her run ragged by her GM and M. Her GM sounds like she is dementing. She is in her 80s and she is not going to be around for long. She is acting out of love. Please try not to show your resentment towards GM and M. Because if you do, your wife will feel even worse because she will be upset that you are upset. It will be another burden in her heart. Support her as best as you can. Are there any community support for elderly people where you live?"
e4et4a,"NTA. Go dance if you want to.

You're not going to ever be his long-term/life partner. The fact that he's keeping you secret from his family even after three years makes that clear. You're just his ""placeholder"" until he marries someone his family finds acceptable. I'm sorry, but that's the truth of the matter.

In addition to that he's making _you_ feel like what you enjoy doing is wrong and dirty, and that female sexuality isn't acceptable to express.

This relationship of yours will end at some point, so I'd get out before he makes you even more miserable."
e4ezyx,"NAH. You aren't required to buy them, but she's allowed to do what she wants. I hate smoking too but my grandma just wants to die and honestly I feel sad that she's still here. If she wanted to smoke, i wouldn't buy em for her, but I don't think I'd stop her."
e4f5k5,"YTA. If your partner is the one who will be looking after the child on weekends, then she ABSOLUTELY should have been involved in the discussion. She's not supposed to be the one taking care of the child all the time. You are. He's your son. It sounds like you and your ex need to get a formal custody arrangement set up and you need to start taking your partner's opinions into consideration before going along with whatever your ex wants, otherwise I doubt you'll be having a partner for too much longer."
e4f9vh,"Completely unrelated but what a shite gift (IMO) 

At least a bottle of wine or something has a purpose..."
e4flqh,"NTA - you owe your family nothing. Put yourself and your husband first, it sounds like you have a lot of healing to do and they’re not going to be remotely helpful with that. I wish you both all the best!"
e4fpv8,"NTA - but I've never understood why people care so much about their things when living in a group setting, Especially with family. I feel like it's easier to just share now and know that (hopefully) you'll eventually be in a financially stable place where you don't have to share with anyone you don't want too. I get the urge to punch your sibblings over using your stuff but in the long run its just stuff and this is just temporary."
e4frcz,NTA you'll continue to make and lose friends for your entire life. Learn a lesson and move on to friends who don't make you uncomfortable.
e4ft0l,NTA - “My wife and kids are my family. They are most important to me.” - that should be enough of a reason.
e4fvj4,"YTA - number 1,  for butting into a conversation that doesn’t involve you. Number 2, for belittling other people’s lives. I’m sorry but I find it hard to believe that you were so evolved as a teenager to not care about ANY “petty meaningless” things.  You can be thinking about college and going to a party. 

And number 3, for pretending at age 25 that you’re some wisen old sage who’s giving such pearls of wisdom to young whippersnappers, how dare they not take your advice. Dude, wake up. You’re still basically a kid yourself, successful business or not. And you clearly have a lot to learn about compassion and people."
e4fvjn,"I know I'm in the minority here, but nta. 

My wife grew up with a mom who would have no food but there would be beer in the fridge. There would be days without electricity or phone, but she'd have her cigarettes.

e4fxoe,"NTA - unless your boss is heavily invested in you and your career, they are always going to do what's best for themselves and the company.

e4glaw,"YTA. While being able to be honest with our friends is important, there was no need to put down her interest in that way. You don’t know if she would actually be a good nurse. The fact that she isn’t a traditionally social person doesn’t mean she couldn’t be a good caretaker. She seemed to enjoy, and do well with assisting her elderly neighbour, so why wouldn’t she do well in other similar situations."
e4gld8,"YWBTA. Your partner doesn’t want you to do this, and since it’s their name I feel like what they want matters more than you getting satisfaction from petty revenge."
e4glrw,NTA holy crap is this guy still hugely popular now?
e4gqcd,"Haha, NTA. They're manipulating you into trying out their product; classic scam/mlm technique."
e4gs80,"YTA. I think if you viewed women as people to be friends with first instead of just potential dating candidates that this situation could have been avoided.  I guess it’s one thing if you’re just looking to hook up, but that’s not really what friends’ parties are for..

If you aren’t trying to “waste time” talking to women with boyfriends, I’d say skip the party altogether because the girls there probably don’t want to talk to you anyway."
e4gty4,"NAH it's your birthday and you should do what you want to do, even if that's nothing. 
Maybe if you explained all of this to the people who are buying the gift, they would understand, you seem like a loving family. 

Maybe you should suggest a different idea like ""I really love that you are trying to make my birthday special, what would really make it amazing, is if instead of Vegas we used the money to have a family trip to (insert a place you would like to go)"". 

That way, your family still get to spoil you like they want, but it's also more what you would want to do rather than Vegas."

e4h5fx,"NAH. His mother put you in a tough spot, no doubt interpreting you as a better friend than you were (after all, you came over in a restaurant and hugged him!).

She put her pride before the animals wellbeing."
e4huc7,"YTA just because you're ""above it"", doesn't mean that ""fat"" isn't a negative descriptor to the rest of the world. I love my body, as a ""Fat Girl"" and I hate it when people think I'm being self-loathing when I describe my body as fat. But I also wouldn't want my friend describing me as ""the fat one"" because I'm more than my body and it *does* imply that I'm the odd one out because I'm fat."
e4i0am,YTA for not taking the time to write a letter. And showing others jumping a turnstile is acceptable.
e4i12l,"NAH. 

There are scientific links between overuse of technology and things like disrupted sleep patterns, stress, depression, etc. (This trend is especially spiking with children and teens.) Your mom isn't wrong to make the changes she did if technology use is an issue. I can't tell you whether or not you or your siblings are ""overusing."" If there are good changes happening, then she should stick with what's working. 

However, it's not necessarily fair for her to punish the ""household"" on the actions of your siblings. You make your post seem like the consequences are more based off of their actions than yours. If this is how you feel, maybe talk to her. 1-2 hours of gaming here and there isn't the end of the world as long as you are doing ok otherwise. But maybe she is seeing something you're not."
e4i3u4,"NTA. Even if it’s true it may have been assholish to bring up unprompted, but at that point she had it coming when she tried to attack your parenting as an absent parent."

e4iajj,NTA. I think this is good parenting. Your step-daughter needs to understand how her actions are affecting others. I think this is a gentle way to help her learn this lesson and will hopefully make her more mindful of others around her.
e4ifkx,"NTA.  For people who aren't into kids, a party full of them is a nightmare.  Parents often get upset because their friendships die after they have kids, but they have to understand that their friends don't want to get together in situations that revolve around children."
e4ihzc,"YTA because of this. Don't embarrass your sister like this. If you know she's in there stay out it's not difficult. Should she lock the door, eh, she should respond to knocks, yes.

e4jhol,"NTA but it does sound like your wife views you cleaning the shed as you getting away from the family, and maybe views her cleaning the bathroom as being in service to the family, and perhaps that’s the disconnect.

And you have to be careful not to over-accuse - jumping to pointing out hypocrisy (her having a character flaw, and you being the judge) rather than trying to understand why she views it differently is perhaps not the best move on your part.

Hope you can talk it out with her."
e4jkta,"YTA because it's depression, not ""depression."" No one needs friends who doubt everything they say."

e4klee,"YTA

At this point I would be more concerned with why she has changed so much and then wonder if you still want to support her. 

Maybe she is just busy or overwhelmed.

Or maybe she is just only sees you as reliable ATMs.

e4l6qq,"NTA Howdy from Texas.  I want to address this a couple of ways if you please.  1) I think you and I both know 14 horses and a 9 stall barn on only 3 acres isn’t right (is it even legal there???) Typically you need at the very bare minimum an acre a horse and that’s just bare grazing.  A stall per horse is also standard care. It sounds like she’s gotten in over her head.  2) I agree whole heartedly with you backing off helping them because what seemed to be a favor in the beginning, appears to now be a burden she’s trying to guilt trip you in.  Stand your ground.  On a side note, the horses really need to be looked at properly and if she’s starting to age in years to where she physically can’t look after them, perhaps it’s time to help her look into other options such as selling the farm.  In the end, the ones suffering the worst will be the animals."
e4lbva,"Let me guess, you’re all teenagers? He should hug who he wants. He’s not kissing her, not grabbing her ass. Don’t be jealous- it’s unattractive. YTA"
e4lpln,"YTA. You told her to stop buying you bracelets, so she’s giving you cash instead. That shows a respect for your boundaries and receptivity to feedback. Maybe it’s not because she’s trying to buy you; maybe she’s just showing you that she still considers you part of the family and she hasn’t forgotten about you and doesn’t want to give up on you. Assuming your grandma’s worst offense is just being excessively religious, you’re being mean. 

You don’t have to go to Christmas. But you should make more of an effort to be kind to your grandma, who clearly misses you.

Consider having a heart to heart about why you’ve distanced yourself. And consider whether there is a third avenue where you can have a cordial and respectful relationship where religion doesn’t come up. 

(fwiw: my parents are also overbearingly religious, and I just grey rocked the shit out of them whenever they brought it up, and now they just don’t bring it up around me anymore.)"
e4lpsw,"1.  NTA.  If he wanted you there, then he would have invited you himself,

e4m5um,"NAH. You both have pretty reasonable stances and I think its up to you both to figure out how to handle this. It's hard having a pet that could remind you of one that has passed, but it also sucks to give up on owning a breed you've owned most of your life because itll make your partner sad.

My parents let me fail a really big project like that in 4th or 5th grade because I just didn’t want to put the effort into it and it taught me (a wildly overachieving Type-A student) that everything requires effort if I want a good grade, and a lot of that requires planning.

Do you have a friend you can stay with?"
e4mtib,"NTA but do you have a lease?  While it sounds like he’s an asshole it’s hard to tell without knowing his side.  If you guys have constant disagreements (regardless of who is right) and you have no lease, then I am not surprised that he used that power card."
e4my1m,"NTA. It's hard to do work for an organization you're not passionate about. Your mental and physical health need to be your priority right now, and your mum will figure it out. It may mean that she needs to scale back the size of her rescue, or find some sort of outside funding to help her staff it, but that's not your responsibility. 

You spent years doing something you actively hated for your mother, it isn't fair to you that she put that on you (whether she meant to or not) and you are totally justified in putting yourself first and taking steps to make yourself happier and healthier. 

Best of luck to you with everything!"

e4nfyg,Nah but you guys need communicate better and work on your finances together so you both know what is going on. There is no excuse for you not to know whether your loans are being pair or not. You're a fool if you our your financial future in anyone elses sole control.
e4nhq5,"YTA
Don’t take this as me saying that you’re a bad person, you’re not. This is a difficult situation to traverse and it’s ok to be confused. However, you know information that could save this man from possibly years of turmoil due to this. If he finds out now before kids, marriage, and you know, life he can, in time, be ok. He can break of the relationship and move on. If you say nothing, there’s a high chance she cheats again and there could be more than just a house on the line, ie kids. I would say be upfront but expect some form of backlash. Good luck OP"
e4nmoe,NTA- are you really contemplating risking an advancement in your career so your bf can continue to be lazy? Please take the job. Who knows if you will get another opportunity. They fact that he is asking you to turn this down is also concerning as well. Something to think about with your partner. They should be encouraging and bring you up. Frankly he sounds selfish.
e4nn5v,NTA and please ignore the people telling you that's you're overreacting or seem crazy. If this post was about someone destroying someone's video games or other nerd crap there would be no question. Destroying your personal belongings is NEVER excusable under ANY circumstances.

e4ny15,Of course but you did it in a manipulative way. You could have easily said yes I’m excited to pick you up because I’ve had a rough day and I need a hug. Instead you expected her to know you needed support by asking a weird question and she seemed immediately annoyed by it.
e4ny3n,NTA she's upset with you because you wouldn't let her cheat.
e4nyzy,NTA. your dad is being emotionally abusive by threatening you with suicide/giving up custody.
e4nz7u,NTA he doesn’t get to decide who hooks up with whom and if it’s because he has feelings for her then he needs to communicate that more than just demanding you don’t get together.

This is the most heart wrenching thing I've ever read. Your dad is a complete fucking asshole. I don't care HOW grief stricken he was, it wasn't your fault and he shouldn't have made you suffer for it. He should have let you enjoy your birthday, what is WRONG with him?!

I'm so sorry about your mom, I'm so sorry your birthday celebrations were stolen from you. I'm so, so sorry. Please have a good birthday and enjoy your cake. Happy birthday, friend."
e4o1wo,"NAH, if she’s considering getting a one that’s secondhand it only makes sense To give her yours. But DO NOT give it to her on her birthday or as a gift. Just give it to her and explain she can have it if she’d like it because you are looking to change brands. It has nothing to do with her birthday. For her birthday give her actual gifts. Don’t even bring up the watch or money at all."
e4o407,"NAH It’s hard to tell sometimes when someone considers you their best friend, especially at a younger age. It sucks you didn’t feel it was mutual but it’s a learning curve in friendships overall as you grow older. Does it suck you didn’t see it that way? Sure but you didn’t have bad intentions."
e4o4k5,"YTA

You found things that were not yours and acted as if they were. How do you even possibly think you are not the asshole here? Obviously you are. Its not your business where he keeps his stuff or if he uses it. It's HIS.

**Edit** to add that the rest of the details about your roommate are irrelevant. You added those to make yourself look better, and tbh this is one of the most biased posts I have seen here. You didn't even try to be impartial."
e4o648,NTA but i would tread lightly. And be prepared to lose a friend.
e4o65t,"NTA. You said that you’d waited for them to cross and that they didn’t. And then when you started turning they moved. Maybe they didn’t see the light change, who knows. 

I think your neighbor was just being judgy. You said the father and son didn’t notice so the neighbor is making a big deal out of nothing, I’d say."
e4o8ar,"NTA. Yeah, it's probably a hurtful thing to say, but you came from a place of honesty, not so much as wanting to offend your mother.

Alcoholism and depression left unchecked can cause a lot of harm to others, whether or not the harm is intended. Unless your mother can genuinely recognize the changes she needs to make and actively work towards achieving the changes, it's understandable why you feel the way you do and wouldn't want her behavior/actions influencing any future children you could have."
e4oc0j,YTA if you limit the policy to just your mom and grandma. Why not extend it to the whole family and do a baked goods exchange instead? That way you wouldn’t be alienating just your mom and grandma.
e4og5s,NTA. Always remember that your boss wouldn't risk their life for you.
e4ogcl,"YTA- Good job burying the content. You cheated on your wife, she was upset enough that her last words were grievances with you, and she died horribly and drawn out. That traumatizes a kid! Meanwhile you have a ""family assistant"" who seems more of a parent than you considering who she turns to for help even if it is just money.  

You think maybe your daughter is acting out because you have been terrible to her mother and clearly not involved enough in her life to have an idea of what is going on? Your description of her friends sounds like you disapprove of everything. Were it drugs and age alone, you may have a point, but throwing ethnicity in there is an eyebrow raiser.  

Moving will just lead her to fall in with the first crowd she finds that she knows you will hate because it sounds like she hates you and it sounds like you have given her reasons. If you want to fix this, you have a lot of work ahead of you and it won't start until you can admit how much you have failed her already. If you want to stick to fighting the symptoms rather than the root cause, don't worry about moving. She will take care of that for you soon enough."
e4ogpc,You're NTA for wanting your parents to treat you like their child and not a roommate whose personal space they can't even respect.

e4oxa6,Dude nta its a cult
e4p1uw,NTA - Getting offended at cards against humanity means you probably shouldn’t play it.
e4p22r,NTA. Your mom sucks.
e4p8rv,NTA but from what you've said about this guy it does sound a bit like he's deliberately sitting in the room to be there while you do it and he comes across as a bit creepy. There's no need to change your routine as you live there and it seems your roommate has some relationship issues to work out.

e4pc98,"YTA your sense of humour kind of tells it all. It's funny among friends but at the expense of other. That's a typical asshole trait. Does that make you racist? No, however, the continuation of racism thrives through people like yourself that allows these things to be said in humour. I use to be the same way so I get where you coming from, but a friend broke it down of the harm it does even in jest."
e4pew3,"YTA - Not because you’re not right, but because you went about it in a way that will almost certainly cause your daughter to rebel against you. You should have been upfront with her. She would have been pissed, but ultimately, know you were acting with her best interests in mind."

e4qa84,"NTA but isn't 31 weeks pretty visibly pregnant? I totally hear you that your pregnancy is more about you and I'm sorry that they're making it about them but if you're worried about it being a secret, I feel like anyone who sees you will probably know anyway? some might not be worth the angst of trying to keep it a secret?

Break up with her. That behavior is unquestionably fucked."
e4qagw,"This might be unpopular but, YTA

It seems like you escalated everything to a point that was unnecessary.

Was he threatening your aunt's safety at the family meeting?

I would say that there are ways to deal with this before escalating it to police involvement. Talking to your aunt, for one. Encouraging her to leave her husband if you think that's apt. Hell maybe even talking to her husband if you feel so strongly about what he's said to her.

You would not be in the wrong for standing up for your aunt. Calling the police based on the facts you've provided, however, seems excessive.

EDIT: Info- on what basis did the police charge him with verbal abuse? Did they witness anything?"
e4qftz,NTA — it’s only natural for children to move out and make their own homes. The fact that she’s manipulative and takes advantage of you only means you need to do it more.
e4qg1a,NAH.  I understand their point about your s/o being 3 years older and possibly taking advantage of you.  Though I do think it's odd they're still not allowing you to go over as an adult.  You also didn't talk about your parents interactions with your s/o and his parents.  Could they not have trusted his parents but trust your sisters bfs parents?  I just think theres a lot of factors that can make the two situations very different and both you and them have good points.  You need to talk to them about letting you be an adult.
e4qjmc,I'm going to abstain from an official verdict here and just say please tell your mom about your anxiety and what boundaries you need so that you're able to show her love in a way that feels good for both of you.

e4qnw4,"NTA. I would decline the religious aspect of it, and you can do so without being the asshole. However, if she is looking at godparent status as ""if we die, will you be guardian for my child"" then there are ways to accomplish that without having to participate in a religious ceremony."

It's not fair to say a friend ""suddenly become part of the mothers group."" People have children, and it's normal and nice, and it's something you aspire to. Don't write them off just because they have something you want.

I don't really think you're an A, I think you're going through something very difficult and you need to see a therapist to work through all this. But I do think you're in the wrong for isolating yourself from anyone who inadvertently says or does the wrong thing.

And if someone told me they were struggling to have children, I would never ask ""which one of you is the problem."" If anyone does ask you that, tell them you're not comfortable discussing it."
e4s30v,"YWBTA. First of all, if your ex is using the money to pay her rent, that is providing your kids with a place to live and is a completely appropriate way of spending the money.

e4sdbi,"ESH - Coming from a dad of 3 and one is a step- daughter, never put the kid in the middle. Wake up and get you SO out of bed if needed, but don’t let that little girl be embarrassed or stressed because she’s late. It isn’t her fault. Plus, kids thrive on routine. Her entire day would be thrown off by getting there late. It doesn’t matter if me and my wife are fighting, all my kiddos know I’d move heaven and earth for them.

e4sjr5,"NTA it's a difficult situation to be in, when you're never good enough. Try to ignore your mom when you do your best and she's still not happy. As long as you're doing the best you can that's reason enough to be satisfied with your self."

You're allowed to have boundaries. In this case, this boundary is vital for you, as it's essential to not have temptations around for you to be able to stay on the wagon.

The person you were seeing is equally allowed to not be okay with respecting those boundaries. He's within his rights to not be sober.

It just means you two are incompatible. Ultimatums are often unreasonable and unnecessary - but this isn't one of those times where the ultimatum was bad.

You did what's right for you. You're not an asshole. 

Don't second-guess yourself; rather, be proud that you could stand up for your own needs.

Stay the course. You've got this."
e4ubvo,"YTA- Not for the rejection, but for the shirt.  You seem to only want to wear it to escalate the situation.  If you were just wearing it to wear it then that’s different.

It’s not appropriate for him to be keeping that. It’s explicit, and while we don’t know the relationship with the ex, I personally know I’d feel uncomfortable knowing my ex still had explicit images of me after a break up. Especially if he was with someone else.

e4xdp7,"YTA. It’s very sad that you dislike your daughter so much you would punish her and literally allow her to be homeless.

You say you’re just doing what your parents did to you but it’s hardly the same. You had the benefit of having your husband stand by you. He worked to support you while you stayed home with your children. Your daughter doesn’t have that. You are literally forcing your daughter and her infant out onto the street. You have a chance to help end the cycle of teenage pregnancy by watching your grandson so your daughter can get her education. Your grandson is statistically less likely to become a teen parent himself if he had a parent with a college degree.

Your daughter is 16. She is legally a child. If you are in the US you are not allowed to make her leave home, it is against the law to force your minor child to live on her own. She and your grandson could end up in CPS custody if you do this. She’s not even old enough to sign a lease for an apartment, some places won’t even hire a 16 year old for a job."

At the very least your mom and grandmother should on top of things like his being up and making noise at 3 AM. A twelve year old should be asleep long before then during the school year.   
They also should know and care that he's tagging, especially if he's so dumb as to use his own name. This could get him into legal trouble. It could also escalate into worse vandalism.

e4xmf8,"NTA it doesn't sound like 'you're no longer in the honeymoon stage' it sounds like he is completely disinterested in the relationship.

If he can't be bothered to talk to you for 10 minutes without napping, but he can video chat with his family for 5 hours straight, I think you know where you stand. Personally I think he's TA for stringing you along and not just telling you he isn't that into you."
e4xn4j,"You guys have some serious issues if you guys are communicating this poorly. Or, on his side, not communicating at all."
e4xo72,"NTA. Quit if you feel that's the best option for you. Consider putting the reason you quit in writing to your manager (and if applicable, to their boss/HR) because you never know when you'll need the documentation to back you up."
e4xoed,"NTA. Not really the sub for this, but note the drama and remember that it will never stop. If you don't want the drama, don't hang out with these people. You are the company you keep."
e4xp3m,"NAH. You and your boyfriend clearly had different views on how much communication was necessary. I understand you getting upset, especially because the project was kind of your project, too. I understand him just wanting to relax and figuring a generic answer would be ok. You both are in the clear, but in the future try to be clearer on what kind of communication you want."
e4xpqr,"NTA, also not the sub for this, try relationship_advice or relationships."
e4xsh8,"NTA/NAH

This all depends on how accurate their statement that they were busy working is.

Obviously you aren't the asshole, because it sounds like you pretty much have it your all and your request wasn't unreasonable; however if they *were* actually busy, you can't really blame them for not taking up the work that you were meant to do.

Also, if S focused on the wrong thing *by mistake* then he also can't be blamed, we're all human. Of course, if he was just pissing about then he's an asshole."
e4xv6d,"NTA but your fiance is. 

He didn’t do the bare minimum of running the dates by people who he needs/really wants to come. 

You just made these plans and your wedding is over a year away. You haven’t even sent out invitations it sounds like. So, I don’t understand why rescheduling is so impossible for y’all if you really want him to come. Is the church really so in demand you can’t find another date?

The fact your in-laws are refusing to discuss the wedding at all now makes me feel like something more is going on."
e4xxe0,"YTA - Visit friends and loved ones while you can. You never know if something horrible will happen to them. Especially if they live far away, take the opportunity to see them. i think since you haven't flown in so long, maybe that could make up for it?  your morals are totally valid but I think you should reconsider your current decision. Is there another mode of transportation? Maybe look into other options."
e4xy87,"YTA, but a very light one. You had spent the whole of this trip knowing you were behind, but made no effort to get ready early on the day of leaving.

There's no reason, though, that the friend on your flight couldn't have waited. Then you would have had someone to walk with, and the friends on the earlier flight could still make their flight."
e4y2wg,"I feel like we need a little more context than this but you are never the asshole for removing toxic people from your life. So even without much information, my judgment is NTA."
e4y4s5,NTA. Relationships with in-laws can be so difficult to navigate. Yours don’t seem to be very understanding people at all.
e4y90y,"NTA. Your kid has no decent immune system yet so its a valid concern to have them around another sick child. Also, if your wife is just 3 weeks post c-section, she should still be resting up, shouldn’t be carrying a car seat, etc."
e4ycsr,Hell no. Definitely NTA for your neighbors mooching off the kindness of your parents. They are even bigger As for trying to guilt trip you by sending their young kids to get you to turn it back on. I sincerely hope your parents cut them off for being such scumbags.
e4ymd3,"NTA your parents’ reaction to learning that you have a working memory is strange. I’d give it back to them like when they say “OP is so petty he’ll remember for a decade”, tell them it’s normal for brains to retain information and if need help remembering which door is their bedroom tell them you’ll lead them by the arm to remind them which one. 
   Same with the “I hope OP doesn’t go snitching” nonsense. Laugh at their immature reaction and flat out tell them to Grow Up. That’s the sort of crap that little kids say to pretend that they’re tough."
e4ynyl,NTA Just tell her you won't be involved with her bridesmaid drama.  It's not your job to mediate things for her.
e4yqhu,YTA. If you have a certain way you want your clothes put away then he should leave it out after they’re clean for you to put away in your specific way
e4yrda,"NTA - they stayed in your house and didn't keep it clean, and then went into your bedroom and your private bathroom without asking FIRST? No way. They've been weird as hell."
e4ytal,"

Judging by the fact that you don't know the difference between taught and thought, I would stop worrying about what other people know. YTA.

>He became even more upset when I mentioned that I though this was basic knowledge that people get thought in elementary school, and repeated until high school."
e4ytp9,"NTA 

You have to take care of yourself as well. Take some time to recharge and don't feel guilty about it."
e4yvxj,"YTA, but mildly. Wearing headphones, whether fully or one in one out, signals to your family that you’re busy and don’t want to talk to them. That’s fine when it’s occasional, but not when you’re always doing it. You’re putting them in the position where they feel like they *always* have to interrupt you in order to talk to you, and that can’t be pleasant for them."
e4ywh6,"NTA. This woman wants your forgiveness so she can die feeling guilt free (to put it bluntly). If you’re not capable of that or ready to, that’s on her. She’s had a lifetime to connect and form a relationship with you, you’ve reached out to her over and over, you should not feel guilty for not wanting to give her your forgiveness (even if you feel it is not owed because you are thankful for being adopted). She shouldn’t have waited until her time was finite, this seems more like a selfish maneuver on her part. It’s for her, not you. Don’t let people guilt you, do what’s best and right for yourself. 


Will it matter to you after she’s been gone for a few years and didn’t get the chance to forgive her? If you think your stance could change in the future, I would consider it."
e4ywvx,"Sorry, but YTA here. The issue isn't that you spent Thanksgiving with friends. The issue is that you traveled to a new city with your mother on a very special, family-centric holiday and then left her on her own so that you could spend time with your friends instead. It you wanted to spend the holiday with your friends, then perhaps this was NOT a trip you should have taken with your mother."
e4yyx2,"NAH

Here’s why, if your son has consistent time management issues this is something I’d consider looking in to. Because if the root cause is something like a executive dysfunction, this “teaching” method won’t make a dent. This doesn’t read as malicious on your part. I don’t think your wife is being an abject asshole, nor your son."
e4z3sy,"NTA, I used to feel bad about leaving retail jobs because I liked the people I work with. But at the end of the day, retail workers are so easily replaceable and corporations will f you over at any moment for a chance at more profit, so I don’t think you should feel bad in the slightest."
e4z44t,NTA. Pay child support and be done with it. An absent parent is much better than one who doesn't want to be there.
e4z45e,YTA for placing the blame on your sister when it’s your parents who are shit heads
e4zdwn,"Run... don’t walk. 

Try a different sub, you need relationship advise, not this."
e4zfpg,"NTA

Ditch her, she sounds draining. 

There's no point sacrificing your enjoyment."
e4zjjc,"NTA.

Your sister sounds entitled and I wouldn’t share it either, if the person simply assumed they could have it without asking first. The balls on that one.

But I’m also super into not sharing food unless I feel like it. I’ll share anything except food, to be honest. And only two or three people can take my food without me getting slightly annoyed."
e4zk4z,"Not necessarily an asshole, but you're an idiot for using a phrase you didn't understand."
e4zm0e,"ESH. You need to agree on how you;re going to handle this as a couple.

I'll add that I'm not American, and there seems to be an emphasis there on encouraging children to actually believe in Santa Claus, even at the age where they're beginning to question it, but I personally don't see why you can't enjoy Christmas traditions without actually insisting on their veracity. If your son's ""appearing to believe for your sake,"" it's gone too far.

>So AITA for just wanting to have a few special Christmases with my son?

That's actually a loaded question, because nobody - not even your wife - is suggesting that you can no longer ""have special Christmases with your son."" I think if you compromise with her, you'll be reminded of really matters here, and that's that you all find a way to enjoy Christmas together."
e4znb9,"YTA. 

Every dog is “well-behaved” until they aren’t."
e4zsva,I'm not going to lie. I had a really hard time reading this. But NTA because you stuck by your friend. People need more ride or die friends in their lives.
e4zu27,"NTA. As a knitter, in a family of “makers”, your brother’s reaction is appalling. Keep your keepsakes away. For now. Your nieces/nephews may learn the value of such love-gifts in the future. 

Also, I’ll gladly accept these creations 😂"
e4zwxv,"ESH. I agree that if she's at home with the children and you're working 12-hour days, the bulk of the cleaning should be her responsibility, and I'd say this if the genders were switched. But the way you said it was pretty disrespectful, and it sounds like you hadn't actually discussed the division of chores before, you just made an assumption. Looking after two children under 3 is hard work, and I wouldn't mind betting by the time you get home she's exhausted and has no idea where the time went. You both need to talk this over, and cut each other some slack.

>I make fairly good money and she is VERY comfortable with her spending.

That's a separate issue. You can't just throw in everything you don't like about your wife and hope it will influence judgments in your favour."
e5004n,"> I work out regularly with equipment I bought with scholarship money.

...Why didn't that money go towards your college tuition?

> I refused to get a job like a regular person and stayed home with the promise that I'd make something happen and eventually become independent through creating an online business. I haven't left since. That was 3 years ago.

YTA. Emotional reparations? Please; you're just a run of the mill leech."
e503v7,"NTA.

Which family members are complaining? You should talk to your dad directly about this. He is the only one that actually knows if he appreciates what you give him.

If he likes and uses your gifts, isn't that the whole  point? Should you give him a silk tie that he'll only use once in a while? Or another pair of slippers or mittens?

It sounds to me like your family members are getting their undies in a twist over how much you are spending on his gifts. And they know that they'd be assholes to gripe about that, so instead they gripe about ""utility,"""
e503wr,"NTA. I feel like you shouldn’t have called her a bitch, just should’ve said no and left it at that"
e504vc,"NTA.

Wtf this has nothing to do with you. If my in-laws were this crazy I'd be doing nothing but making popcorn."
e50845,"Yta if you actually used the phrase “my destiny lies elsewhere.” Otherwise I’d suggest you lighten up a little on the hometown hate, but it doesn’t make you an asshole to want to do something different from your old friends."
e508o1,Are you actually going to end a friendship for such a stupid reason? A trolley? Of all things?
e509q0,"ESH

She sucks for obvious reasons.

You responded to her bitching about you being unfair by turning around and actually being unfair. And you're shooting yourself in the foot- if you're really giving her way too much work, then she will be able to compile evidence and eventually your bosses will notice, and then you'll probably lose your delegating privileges in general.

Assign her stuff you don't like, that's fine, but don't blatantly give her a disproportionate amount to do."
e50at3,NTA. You were 30. The implication that you didn't/don't know what you want/don't want at 30 is astounding.
e50c7m,"YTA -- Don't call out, that's fine. But then find some way to get your own grown ass to work. 

You can't try to force your mother to drive in conditions she's not comfortable with while simultaneously going on about how you refuse to drive because you once got in an accident, right? That's be bonkers. Did I mention YTA? Drive yourself or hush up and call out."
e50c8p,"NTA It's your house, you get to decide who/what comes into it. Your friend is probably upset they can't smoke with you and are taking it out wrongly."
e50ekj,"NTA especially if comments in the paper don’t match the grade on the rubric. The problem with their swapping system is that it opens you up to bias from other teachers. Asking from a second opinion, if not from your teacher, then from a 3rd teacher, seems reasonable."
e50evd,YTA for deliberately using the wrong pronouns. No wonder your daughter (who is too young to be TA) doesn’t want this girl there. Children learn from their parents.
e50fcl,"NAH

You were grateful and polite. You can't change your feelings.

Can you ask your Dad to help set up the new computer in a way that is comfortable for you to work? It sounds like he is knowledgeable and skilled. That will show him you really do appreciate the gift, and help you get the best out of it"
e50j82,"NTA Even is there was something wrong in the towel closet, having them neatly folded will help.  If she had told you the issue, you could have fixed/moved them around to her liking.   
Sounds like she was in a lot of pain and that her pain isn’t managed very well (maybe she can’t afford medication?). Hopefully she will calm down and appreciate your efforts."
e50kgp,"While it's alsways objectively true you only get to hear one side of the story,this one just feels extra onesided.

>I was best friends with this woman for years, let's call her Pamela. We had our ups and downs, but always stayed strong, and we always had each other. The recent years I've expanded my social network quite a bit, and as a result I think she started to get insecure.

Your story of what went wrong ends with an assumption. That's never good because it means you two never got to talk that shit out. That's what happens sometimes.

You make Pamela sound like a toxic bitch, but I'm sure Pamela could make you sound like a toxic bitch in a reddit post too.

You need the judgement of friends or family who has a chance at knowing both parties.

Reddit will keep telling you NTA because of your extremely onesided portrayel of Pamela as a complete asshole."
e50paq,"NTA

Client was informed what was required to achieve what they asked for. Client failed to provide such conditions. I wouldn’t edit the photos beyond what you would have if you had gotten your photo spot. If they want you to heavily retouch or edit the photos to mimic what they WOULD have gotten, I feel that’s extra hours on your part and so would require a additional compensation."
e50qc7,"Hmm... is this an AITA issue?

It sounds like your mom has some issues, because she isnt really acting or presenting herself the way an adult should. I think you need to talk to your father about your concerns."
e50uqm,she definitely needs to pay you but asking original price for a 6 year old laptop is ridiculous
e50w8i,"NTA, if they weren't letting you participate after you asking multiple times then theres not really anything good for you to say about them, group activities are supposed to be group efforts that everyone works on together"
e51143,[deleted]
e512ru,"YTA, you're living in her house and she's been kind enough not to charge you rent. Get your self one of those insulated lunch bags that can be put in the fridge. Pack yourself a lunch from the left overs when the food is ready, or just use your words and ask your mom and boyfriend to save a little food for your lunch. You don't sit up in her house, living rent free and then have the audacity to refuse to offer her dinner."
e512zs,"NTA. The wedding is the most important thing to your sister, your classes are the most important thing to YOU. Your mother is wrong for trying to pressure you into prioritizing the wrong thing. When a wedding is scheduled to take place \*right before\* the end of the semester, I think just managing to physically be present is all anyone should be expecting of you. That goes triple for a ""destination"" wedding.

I also think you should step down as the MoH in your sister's wedding. The MoH has a lot of responsibilities, and right now you don't have the time (or money) to take them on. So tell her you'd like to step down so that either one of her friends or maybe one of your SILs can take that role instead."
e51dil,"NTA because that place is a just bad for your health.

Don't avoid the conversation. Be very clear with your husband that why you can't go. Explain, that you are not saying this to criticize them, but their lifestyle has side effects, namely that they way they live is just bad for your health and you need to limit your exposure to it.

Avoiding confrontation is not healthy for a relationship. It just kicks the issue down the road and when it does come up it is 100 times worse."
e51fq3,"NAH

You need to discuss this. Calmly, lovingly, but you need to talk about it, before the resentment really kicks in.

My advice. One parent gets up and does everything each night, but you alternate nights. No reason for both of you to be awake."
e51ggh,"NTA

1. You got your grandmother's blessing
2. Your grandfather doesn't care. He's dead."
e51jyo,"NTA, i would not consider him a good guy. That is legetimate manipulation. He manipulates you into staying and profiting of your talents. I would report it to HR since if he did this to you, he will probably do it to someone else if he's never in trouble because of it"
e51l4j,"NTA, but I do think you could have done a tad better. It's completely understandable to kind of freeze up when someone else snaps, so I can't blame you for standing there and basically just thinking WTF, but it's not like her frustration came out of absolutely nowhere or was a frustration that you hadn't experienced yourself. You didn't have to back her up, but when she and the neighbor started arguing you could have intervened to try to mediate and maybe explain how you both have felt in the past in a less aggressive way in order to defuse the situation a bit. Your neighbor may still have been pissed, but it could have helped alleviate the situation a little too. And while your girlfriend's reaction towards you is a little inappropriate, I think maybe just take into account where she may be coming from. Clearly she's in the wrong, but it wouldn't hurt if you acknowledged to her that you completely understand why she would want you to have her back in any kind of stressful situation, even if she was very obviously handling things in the wrong way in this instance."
e51m23,"NTA

You’re paying for a fair education, the laziness created an unfair advantage. I’d definitely report it."
e51mdb,"NTA. He has a chore, either complete or dont expect a prize for half assing it, especially if he knows that you’ll just swoop in and finish it. That’s a total dick move."
e51ng0,"NAH (I'm sticking strictly to the ticket conundrum and at any rate you've taken responsibility for the falling out)

""...COUPLE have decided they don’t want to continue with the friendship."" I think you and your BF have to respect that and leave them alone. Besides, I doubt they want to sit next to you two at this show. If they really want to go, they will buy their own tickets, I would think. Unless they are cheaper than they are offended."
e51oss,NTA. If this like a dormitory common room space it’s free use and it is a common room/area where in which people use it all the time. It isn’t part of her room it’s part of the shared agreement that you have
e51pd1,"ESH, but I understand where you're coming from. Your stepmom is clearly the asshole, and you responded in an asshole manner, but as a fellow clothing reseller the thought of someone carelessly trashing a freaking BURBERRY BLAZER would probably drive me off the deep end too. Basic human decency indicates that if you borrow something from someone, ask first, and if you damage it, apologize and do what you can do to fix it. The fact that your stepmom has done neither is unfortunate, and you don't deserve to be treated that way. 

But with that said, to be frank, what's right and wrong doesn't matter in this instance. Your dad has demonstrated that she's on her side regardless of whether or not she's wrong, and the two of them are in control of your living situation. So, deal with it in whatever way is easiest for you, and be glad that they won't be in control of it for much longer."
e51q0h,"Do you have to say it?

Can you make socializing with them a dine-out situation? Stay in a hotel and dine out.

NTA"
e51szf,You don't use enough periods.
e51tz0,"NTA, you've split up and if she wants to choose a low paying career that's on her. I'd suggest getting a lawyer though as it sounds like she's counting on child support to bank roll her income above needs for the child, especially as you have  him almost 50% of the time."
e51vp1,NTA It's the MoH's job to organize the bachelorette party. You give your input and she ultimately does the scheduling or organizing. I don't blame you for wanting to be the lead in something like that.
e51w4m,"I dont think yta for receiving the gift, but yta for discounting your partner's feelings about it. It may be nothing to you, but its clearly not to him. it's not fair to your current relationship to put a past partner's desire to give gifts above your current partners (reasonable) discomfort with it."
e51yhd,"NTA. Bedbugs will not go away. They will multiply and everyone in her house will eventually get them, then their homes will be invested. 

There are a very small percentage of people who for whatever reason don't get bitten by bedbugs. Maybe she is one of these people. Has she been bit? She would have red itchy welts if she has. 

Regardless of whether or not she is bitten by them most of her friends at parties will get them and they are really bad. So you should tell everyone for their own protection."
e51ymb,"NTA

Pay her back for the meals, the rest is yours."
e51za7,"Girlfriend here. First off, it's ADD, not OCD. Second, I never asked you to come because I know it irritates you. I was perfectly content to do the shopping on my own, and then as I was leaving you told me, completely unprompted, ""don't take 2 hours about it this time."" When I asked what that meant you had a go at my shopping by recipe.

I do find it easier to shop by recipe because I'm still figuring out my medication for my, again, ADD, the symptoms of which include lack of attention to detail, forgetfulness, and, shockingly, attention deficit. If I have a list done by recipe then it helps me keep track of what I'm getting and I know that I need to get this, that and the other for Monday and this, those and these for Tuesday ect so I don't lose track. I've tried other methods, and I'm sure there are other methods I could use, but this one is the one I happen to find easiest. I've tried going by category but that leads to me forgetting something or not getting enough of something.

He did say it drove him crazy, which pissed me off because he uses it the way someone else would use ""babe"", as in greeting me with ""hey crazy"". I've asked him to stop multiple times because I really hate being called crazy but he still does it.

And then, to top it all off, he posts this extremely biased account to make me seem MORE crazy hoping it'll shame me into changing my shopping method.

YTA."
e521go,"If you have to ask, don't do it."
e523cg,"NTA. The smell of smoke is nasty, and I wouldn't be able to handle that either."
e527pq,"ESH
Coworker for kissing you knowing you have a bf.

Bf for telling you not to tale the ride home, but not coming to get you because he's ""hanging out"". That's a saftey issue. Seems like he doesn't care if you're safe.

You for not telling the coworker it was inappropriate and not telling your bf what happened."
e527yt,"NTA. Honestly I’m a spiteful bitch, it’d be fun to watch her open that box."
e52b8e,"YTA - it's a lot of money and you're allowed to be annoyed about it, but be so privately or to people who didn't know and aren't grieving over your grandmother.

What good did you honestly think was going to come from complaining about it to your siblings who are grieving? You had the good sense not to complain about it to your mom since it's not her issue to deal with, what made you think it was ok not to extend that courtesy to your siblings?"
e52boc,"YTA 
She's known him longer than you. You trust her to look after your baby. She's a reliable, trustworthy person.
She took an eleven year old to McDonald's on his birthday. Even if he ate the saltiest, fattiest, most sugar drenched thing on the menu it was one meal and won't harm him. It's a fun trip for a kid, especially if it's not something he gets to do often.

She took him to visit her family, presumably because they've known him for a long time and wanted to wish him a happy birthday. That's kind and a chance for him.to meet people outside his usual social group

What's particularly concerning is that an experienced professional who knows your stepson very well says she ""feels sorry for him"" and you dismissed her concerns.  
I think you should speak to get further and find out what she means, and if there's something wrong"
e52dls,NTA. This is why one has to be so careful when blending families. To go from having a room to being made to feel like a guest hurts. There should have been some conversation before any renovations happened. Give your dad a chance though. He knows he messed up and does want to fix it
e52gfx,"ESH.  Your brother isn't even required to give anyone gifts, but giving used and damaged gifts is tacky.  If you aren't eating for a week, you're spending too much on gifts.  Stop trying to make up for the kids lives by getting them expensive gifts and expecting anyone else to give expensive gifts."
e52h58,NTA - she is scared of the doctor and blame is easier to go with than fear.
e52ln4,"NAH

Mate don't be stupid, this was a golden opportunity. That woman deserves a gift after that lmao."
e52m6l,"NTA. This is unacceptable behavior. I am surprised how nobody seems to have noticed that she propositioned your son. The fact that your girlfriend is still willing to let her within range of your son speaks very poorly of her judgment.

Both you and your girlfriend have the right of veto-power over who gets to visit and this seems a good case to enforce it."
e52n2i,"YTA - you would rather others get more $ than your grandpa?  I don't think you realize how tough it is to save up $, let alone your grandpa sacrificing his own retirement and wealth so you can go to college. 

10 years later you may stumble upon this thread and realize how ridiculous this question is."
e52nc0,Nta. That's a stupid reason to get mad about something. Its fucking makeup.
e52nfi,"NTA. Many have this problem, me included. I cannot stand loud chewers and feel a sort of fight or flight response. I just turn the tv up louder or make sure not to sit too close because I risk getting frustrated and lashing out."
e52p3o,"NAH

They are not assholes for asking for help. You are not an asshole for refusing to give them money.  You are not an asshole for offering them money under certain conditions (ie they make a move that you believe will reduce their future need for financial help), since they can either accept it or not."
e52p97,"NTA. Your boyfriend sounds like one of those insane people who think they are so nice for treating animals like they are children. A cat doesn't know what 'I'll give you up for adoption means'. My cat doesn't know what I mean when I say 'keep waking me up at 6 am, you asshole, and I'll turn you into a fur collar'."
e52qlv,"YTA big time. It's your fault you hadn't slept in 48 hours. It's your fault you were driving dangerously, and you could have killed someone. It's your fault you slept through your alarm. And it's your fault you got replaced. The director should have replaced you sooner. You had the lead role and couldn't be bothered to make rehearsal."
e52sck,"NTA. 

He is kinda putting you out by using the garage. Instead of trying to get money for it, just don't let him park in the garage. 

""hey, it is starting to snow, I am gonna start using my garage!""

If he pushes back, then ask him to start paying you for it."
e52xnt,"NTA. That's exactly how it works, they won't be taking over your existing account - they'll be starting a new one. Call the utilities companies and tell them you want your account closed on X date. Let the roommates know your account is closing the day you move out, and that they can call to set up a new account to avoid service being interrupted. If their utilities get cut off it will 100% be on them."
e52yg6,"NTA

You're allowed to end friendships."
e530dr,"NAH

Yeah, it's a diet cookbook...for the diet she is explicitly on. I think it's a thoughtful gift."
e5317o,Ethical it ain't!!! But I would keep it 100%. Amazon it a notorious tax dodger and piss poor company to work for. Low wages and harsh conditions. Fuck em
e531ru,[deleted]
e5343a,"NTA. 

Emily thinks she has it bad? My husband died. Emily’s not allowed to feel/express her pain because I have it worse. How inconsiderate of her to talk about her military boyfriend when there are actual SPOUSES that have been widowed.  - editing to note that this is sarcasm.

Tell I said her she’s being a self-obsessed jerk. Her experience should be teaching her compassion."
e539er,"General rule of thumb, you dont step between siblings. Ever. No matter the argument, as long as it doesnt get physical. NTA."
e53bta,"YTA, twice over.

If dog poop is a problem, the DNA testing seems like a necessary step. But DNA tests cost money, so SOMEONE has to pay for it. If you're not charged that fee, that essentially means that it will be charged to everyone in the building by being bundled in with rent or whatever other fees you pay to management. To me, seems only fair that dog owners should pay for their dogs. Just like you don't know who it is, no one else in the building knows for sure that it's not you.

You're especially the asshole for being such a prick about a $30 fee that the staff were avoiding you. It didn't ""pay off."" You sold your dignity for $30."
e53dzs,NTA. Your sister in law sounds like she was being purposely obtuse and ignoring you so she could keep behaving how she wanted to.
e53fgq,"NTA. You did handle it correctly, very correctly. It is insulting, asking someone to bark like a dog for a bigger tip. Everything you said and did was right, and the guy made a fuss because he was embarrassed, as he should've been. Not the asshole, good for you!"
e53isz,"YWBTA if you tried to control what you’re employees wearing because it’s reminding you of your ex. It may be hers it may not be hers, maybe she just bought it because she liked it on her friend. Sorry about your break up but man don’t freak out on your coworker for the clothes they are wearing."
e53k13,"NTA. He's not your responsibility and you owe him nothing. His children can pay if they're that concerned, and can split the cost between them. If you're interested, maybe offer to chip in, but don't feel obligated to do so."

e53rl7,i think you’re making the conflicting birthdays an issue way too early...due dates can be sort of arbitrary. i’m one of 3 and none of us were actually born on our due date. seems like an unnecessary conflict to bring up with your already upset wife IMO
e53sqt,YTA for posting this when you know you're not TA of this story
e53vjw,"NTA - he crossed a line, and you were direct in asking him to dial it back.  He doesn’t need to be attracted to you in order to violate your personal boundaries.  His friends may think you were rude because many young people (girls especially) are conditioned to always be polite and not make others feel unwanted or unliked.  However, you have valid reasons for pulling back and no obligation to extend friendship to someone who makes you uncomfortable.  Your ability to be direct and communicate your feelings clearly will serve you well in life."
e53vqa,"NTA. She's three. Dates don't mean *anything* to her. It'd be different if she were like 8 and you were just flat out lying to someone who can tell time and read a calendar, but at three years old, having Christmas 3 days later isn't going to change anything."
e53wih,"NTA. If they don’t treat you kindly, you aren’t obligated to spend your holiday with them."
e53y14,"YTA. You sound exhausting. Why not apologize for something you feel you've done wrong, first, instead of waiting for her to come to you? You are the asshole for being ""picky' with apologies."
e53zl3,"NAH. You aren’t obligated to meet someone you don’t want to, but I think you should really think about it before you decline."

Can you take them with you? That might be a good teachable moment... them coming home to an empty house with no explanation."
e54cms,"YTA- This is a perfect example of elderly people being treated without  respect. It seems to me that as soon as someone is viewed as ""insignificant"" in society  they are open for public humiliation, scorn, ignoring their existence or general disrespt. When you live with someone you experience their personal moments and it is simple common sense to preserve your roommate, family member, spouse, children's privacy out of basic repsect and honoring the space that is shared by keeping your big mouth shut.  If you haven't already please hand write a letter of deep regret and offer to ammend the wrong doing.  Also, sincerely ask if there were other reasons she evicted you so rapidly because this sounds like the last straw that broke the camel's back, not the first offense."
e54deo,"NTA

Was it snarky? Sure, but this person was being an absolute dick to people who have no choice but to be polite because they're at work. People like that deserve a little reality check and you were in a position to give it to him. Fuck people who feel like they can talk down to others just because they're not in a position to defend themselves."
e54geg,"YTA

so you're excluding them because they (presumably) don't drink...

and because they (presumably) don't drink they won't be fun??

these are her friends and if the purpose of this trip is to spend it with other couple friends then yes, YTA. she even offered a compromise of another location but you don't think that's fun either?

maybe you're the one who isn't fun."
e54hky,"NTA

While disabled people also have a right to earn a living, if they are claiming disability and working more than the permitted hours, it is fraud. People like that make it so much harder for those who genuinely need help. And if it turns out that they are within their allowance, honestly, there is no harm done.

However, I also wouldn't continue to work somewhere where the hours were that fickle. Are your hours contracted or do they change week on week?"

But you should accept the position of supervisor. It will look better on your resume and will likely be for more pay. If you are going to be working there, you might as well be machiavellian about it.

Keep the work relationships cordial as well. Don't have to be close friends, but you never know when a work acquaintance now could be a useful connection in the future."
e54va2,"NTA - I have a great dislike for HOAs but this is the reason why they exist, so if they are going to exist (and you're going to be paying the dues for it) then you might as well use it to justify having your neighbor clean up his shit.

I’ve been stuck on the subway before for well upwards of 30 minutes, so it definitely happens (and indeed happens pretty often). 

You say this is totally unlike her, so instead of being worried about her, you leave the restaurant. She texted you at 7:38p and called you multiple times (just like you did). You didn’t check your phone for 20 minutes because you were on the subway and there’s no signal."
e550wr,"YTA.

Damn. This is cold. Your wife stopped to help someone else bring a new life into the world, and you're worried you lost some ""me time""? She then offered to make up for it, and that wasn't good enough?

This is very petty. You are 100% TA."
e55163,"NAH

She doesn't need her own room, but not having one pretty much says it's not her home. I moved away for almost 8 years and when I came back home, my room was there for me.

You couldn't afford the house. That's understandable, but just because your daughter is an adult now doesn't mean she can't have her own feelings regarding it."
e552i1,"NAH

This seems like a kid just not fully understanding a situation, which happens all the time. What are the chances she's already familiar with how a financial loan works? I don't think she was being a brat on purpose, that's a *lot* of money to a 12 year old. 

I also don't think you were wrong to ask for it, or to use authority when she refused. I think getting to the family Thanksgiving is more important than making a 12-year-old happy. In fact, good on you for offering the extra $5 if she would help. As long as you refunded her, all will be forgiven later in her life and this will be a silly story for family gatherings."
e552vp,YTA. MEPS is so easy to reschedule that it is actually offensive that you think it is more important than seeing your sister graduate. Whats worse is you know that is something you CAN reschedule. Whats worse is you decided to be an even bigger prick and try to compare your Father NOT BEING ALLOWED to return for important events to you NOT WANTING to go to your sisters important events. Instead of making excuses just tell your sister that you dont care shes graduating and you have no plans to improve the relationship between the two of you.

I can't really judge this as it seems like you want the best for the cat but contact the ""owner"" first. I personally think the cat is better off with you.

e55m29,"NTA. She's being really immature, and she needs to realize that there's more to life than sex."

Additionally, your kids have an absolute right to their DNA.  Read the fine print on 23 & me, they own the DNA.  We don't know what the next 100 years will bring in terms of genetics and DNA strands.  Protect your kids.  Your unfounded doubt is no reason to hand their DNA over to third parties."

No offense, but you sound really immature. The fact you can barely control yourself when your partner needs to abstain from sex and are upset that he doesn’t want you to jerk him off into a cup is honestly extremely bizarre. I have genuinely never even heard of someone’s partner assisting in sperm sample collection. That just seems awkward and like it could even contaminate the sample.

Work on self restraint and take a moment to realize that not EVERYTHING has to be done together, especially when he firmly tells you no. You are not entitled to his body. If you want to have a child and healthy marriage, you also need to work on your communication with your husband.

Edit: Your post history shows you have a horrible relationship with your underage stepdaughter to the point you want to move out for the nights when she visits?? This whole situation seems like a recipe for disaster. You need to talk to your husband at the very least, learn about boundaries, and work on maturing."

Edit-to-your-edit: These are all just justifications and excuses for doing what we're telling you (and you must know) is wrong.

Honestly, I was upset when I first found out my boyfriend had one. I felt like it was nicer looking than my parts and maybe even better feeling. It was smooth, never had to be shaved and never had razor burn. It was intimidating and I couldn’t understand why.

My boyfriend was always fine with me using my vibrator during sex, so I felt out of line.
I had to come back to reality. I will always be better than a sex toy. Once I understood this I even used it on him during sex. I believe that we are afraid of things that we don’t understand and things were are not use to. I was fine after that. It’s a toy, it does the same thing as his hand. He still always wants the real thing.

e59jst,YTA for even adding this into your decision of who to let go. Watching your child is not a part of their job description and you should really figure out your own childcare. It's ridiculous to ask a subordinate to babysit for you on the job.
e59ktr,"ESH.  Instagram presents an idealized version of life, a fantasy, this isn't new information.  I would directly confront your mom about this, tell her how uncomfortable you are with the way she portrays the family on Instagram and forces the kids the do stuff.

e59kwx,"This is way above this sub’s paygrade. Your spouse is is depressed and likely in crisis. You leaving won’t make it better, but he’s not TA for suggesting it. He really needs to see someone ASAP. And you need to not take his irrational ideas personally."

I don't blame them from cutting ties with you. They may come around eventually but you probably severed some serious bonds, at least with the older two.

At the very least, it would have been better for your wife to go alone and do a long distance relationship with your wife instead of your kids. This would have worked better if your wife would later be able to transfer back. Or I'd be more understanding if you were on the verge of homelessness. 

No halfway decent parent would chose a dream job over their children. No halfway decent parent should chose a spouse iver their minor children."
e59wi0,"Oh NTA. I often believe that if someone overlooks racism/transphobia/homophobia in terms of people they associate with, then it reflects on their own opinions/beliefs too.

You did right in cutting her out, although, I do advise you give her an explanation. Something simple on the lines of “Hey Anna, I’m sorry but I feel we are no longer on the same page and feel our friendship has ran it’s course. I find (said friends) behaviours unacceptable and cant bring myself to associate with them or anyone else who can willingly accept such toxic behaviours/beliefs.

YTA.

You  insisted on reading his manuscripts and then told him they are utter hot garbage and would rather read the future in the shit-filled diapers of the local dementia ward of the elder care hostel than pick up his work and read it for pleasure.

As a professional writer, I can assure you two things:

If you think your writing is beautiful and godly and ""life's work"" - it sucks.

If you think your partner is a good test audience for your ""life's work"" - you aren't looking for honest feedback, you're looking for delusional support.

You're only the asshole because of the way you handled the situation - in the most crushingly painful way you possibly could have handled it.

Look, my friends and writing partners have had a straight-up agreement: we have a common goal in mind, which is to get honest, useful feedback that we can use to build out our fiction work. It's all practice until one of us gets the best-selling novel - even the stuff that DOES get published.

But I gotta tell you that what you did was quite possibly the one thing I have told everyone in any writing group or any ""new novel writer"" group is the single thing NOT TO EVER DO TO ANYONE YOU JUST MET.

And you did it to your husband.

Let that sink in for a minute.

You did something that I will ban people for life from a writing group and tell them not to let the door hit them in the ass on the way out. You did something that is so completely uncool that just forwarding this to another writer whom I work with in another city said, ""Holy shit, what's this person's name? They sound just like this woman I kicked out last week and told never to come back.""

And you did it TO YOUR HUSBAND.

God, are you EVER the asshole here. Not just mildly so, but on a whole different level.

Unsolicited from you would be just straight up insensitivity.

What you did was the equivalent of demanding to see someone's progress and then saying the whole thing was utter shit and demanding a match and a can of gas so you could burn it all down.

I'm going to tell you right now that if he doesn't divorce your ass, I'd be shocked. That's beyond disrespectful. That's abusive.

By the way, had anyone done something remotely CLOSE to this in a writing group that I mediate, that person would be banned and blacklisted from all local writing groups. It's happened before. What you did is so far off the pale it's not even funny.

I hope that one day you find yourself in this situation, where you offer the core of yourself to someone you love because they insist that you should because you love them so much...

...and they drop it on the ground and proceed to shit on it as thoroughly as you've shit on your husband's.

Damn, you suck.

e5axtb,"YWB-NTA if you're doing it just to get your dad a hoodie from the team he likes. However, YTA because you're doing it with the intent of replacing a gift you didn't deem good enough. Was what your step mom gave him a licensed product? No. But it was made from the heart. Money wasn't an issue, as you said. Sometimes people have trouble shopping for others when money isn't an issue because, what do you get someone who can buy whatever they want? So she did something thoughtful and I'm sure put a lot of time and effort into it. The action isn't the problem on your end, it's the intent behind it. Much like the intent behind her gift two years ago was love."

e5b13g,YTA because he’s literally just trying to be a good partner. If you’re as good friends as you say you should be happy he’s treating his partner well. He didn’t say no he just said he needed to check. That’s the correct response. It’s incredibly disrespectful to make plans on someone else’s behalf and then have that person be the asshole by having to decline later etc. Your birthday is on a popular night. Surely you have accepted by now that you have to kind of let go of the expectations that people will prioritize your birthday over anything else (excluding family and partners of course). I have a similarly popular birthday. It’s hard but honestly saves a lot of disappointment when I just accept that a lot of people will be busy and it doesn’t mean they don’t care about me

e5b3j7,"Hmmm gonna go with NAH. You may be misinterpreting how your sister feels about you. I would assume that she loves you and wants you to be involved in one of the biggest days of her life, not just to be an observer. I wasn’t there, but I think you may have just misread her tone when she asked. At the same time, she needs to recognize that you have physical and mental limits that you cannot necessarily overcome. You two should work out a way for you to be involved in the wedding (not necessarily a part of the bridal party) that is comfortable for you both."
e5b3xj,YTA. Put your stuff away. It's not your dad or brother's job to gently put your things away -- it's your job.

e5b67p,"YTA for trying to parent him. You are doubly the asshole for recommending a pseudoscientific, discredited ""medical"" practice to him.

Nothing she did prevents you from dumping him.  You had the exclusive talk, yet he was dating other girls.  His ""story"" shouldn't matter, you should immediately dump him.

Getting pissed at your friend is only going to hurt you in the long run.  You become the girl that no one wants to tell the truth because you take it out on the wrong person.  

Apologize to your friend."
e5c97b,NTA tbh your dad is at fault if he thinks you’re really that much of a burden on the “SMITH” name then you should change it I guess but I mean try and see if you can work it out before doing anything at least try and seal the bandage before ripping it off

I think people will disagree with me, but personally, if you're comfortable, I don't feel like paying your sister's phone bill is much of an issue.

e5cxzx,"NAH, sure that mom said she's having a 'rough time', but it could be work related or something personal that she may or may not have wanted to discuss with you. I mean if you really wanted to know, you could go out for coffee or lunch with her and casually bring it up in a conversation by saying ""I'm a realtor and my husband does yadayada"" & you can describe how your job is to her. If she doesn't respond with what she does, then just understand she doesn't want you to know and leave that topic.

Also, your husband makes some valid points. If you already have an assistant, wouldn't it be better to give him the extra hours because he'll feel like you don't value him as an employee. If you do give this mom that position without talking to your other assistant and explaining as to WHY you're doing it, then YTA because that's disrespectful to the assistant.

I get you're trying to be a genuinely concerned person but you should talk to your husband and refocus your view."
e5cyq1,"NTA. If they loved you like a grandparent should, they would try to understand. They’re intentionally disrespecting you, and I don’t blame you one bit for not wanting to associate with them."
e5czjv,"NTA.

My wife and I had an open relationship, and despite my mom being ""moderately socially liberal,"" I still didn't think she'd fly with the whole thing so I lied about it constantly. Never once did I come out to her about it.

Given how off the rails she went about other (far more benign) things, I feel 1000% correct in my decision to do so. I wouldn't change a thing.

Fact is: Your lifestyle (and the labels that accompany it) are yours. You get to decide who to share them with, to what extent, etc. Clearly, after the first blowup, you knew that your mom wasn't as chillaxed as you; your peace of mind comes first, so you absolutely can and should choose how much to divulge/withhold.

Your mom needs to grow up; my mom did too. When you're gone and living your life (with all the people who make you happy and accept you), maybe she will; in the meantime, divulge details on a need-to-know basis and keep her in the dark lest you're willing to forfeit peace-of-mind."

It can be considered insulting to a chef, to add salt or pepper to a dish, without tasting it first.  How could you possibly know it needs seasoning without trying it first?

Similar idea with trying the vegetarian chili.

You weren't trying the vegetarian chili, you made your own concoction with the vegetarian chili as an ingredient.

One possible reason she could have taken offence, would be: you aren't giving vegetarian food a chance, if you have to add meat to it, before you give it a try.

It is one thing to say - ""Hey that looks good, can I try some?"" Try it, and find it less appetizing than you expected - then fix it.

It is an entirely different scenario to ask for it, then tell the very person who made it - it is unacceptable unless the forbidden fruit is added.

Not EXACTLY what you did, but kind of is."
e5d5v8,"YTA.  You took another persons stuff and just threw it away because it was negatively affecting you.  You mention you are selling your home and use this as a justification saying essentially that this was lowering your home value.  How do you think that that gives you the right to throw away someone else's belongings. 

&#x200B;

 A crappy car in someone else's home can negatively effect home prices for everyone in the neighborhood, do you think it would be appropriate for me to call a tow truck and have a neighbors car towed because I'm trying to sell my home?

&#x200B;

If you did that I'm pretty sure you and everyone else would acknowledge that you are the asshole?  What makes this situation different?  Is it because this guy is homeless?  If so you are essentially saying it is OK to harm people as long as they are defenseless."
e5d69q,"NTA - Address this immediately. Those excuses are practically triggering a PTSD episode on my end. They seem to think they have the upper hand in this situation by outnumbering you in how you feel about it vs. how they feel about it — **when how they feel about it is flat out inconsiderate, unfair and disgusting.** I went through the **exact same fucking thing** of two new roommates of mine befriending one another, both turning out to be slobs — and trying to gaslight ME in thinking I’M in the wrong for expecting basic sanitary living conditions for a shared space. When I think back to how infuriating this really was, my emotions about it still come out lol.

Thankfully in your situation it seems as though you have a third party who will handle it formally. In my instance, I only had a landlord who didn’t intervene or give a shit about anything other than collecting rent. It led to me having to leave notes, get in to screaming matches with them out of frustration, and eventually begin to send disgusting photos of their mess *(with flash on)* to them in group texts CONSTANTLY to annoy the fuck out of them, and leave their piles of dirty dishes in front of their bedroom doorways so that I could use the sink that I’m also entitled to.

Best of luck."

e5dc9j,"As someone who used to be super thin I can confirm that people make these kind of comments all the time. It's considered rude to comment on someone's body when they're fat, but perfectly normal when they are skinny - this is exactly what you have experienced here, the double standard. I can also confirm that it is definitely damaging to your self image as a skinny girl to constantly hear these kinds of things. Being too thin can be extremely unhealthy. When you identify as the skinny girl you often deliberately make choices to keep you skinny, because that's who you are. Like only eating half your meals, only choosing healthy food etc. Most of the time the people affected don't necessarily realise what they're doing. Some people take it too far and they become anorexic or bulimic. I have 2 sisters who have battled with eating disorders because of it. One is so bad she has ruined her teeth from vomiting (bulimic) and has to get regular IV nutrients just to stay alive. 

I realise you were standing up for your girl, and kudos to you for that. If you had omitted the word fat from your insult I'd be all for you, but knowing how bad body image issues are for so many people I have to say ESH. She shouldn't say what she said, but likely doesn't realise the impact of her statements. But on that same token, it's never ok to use language that makes someone feel bad about their body - fat or thin."

Gently tell him his son may not stay in the main house, but he's welcome to add a bed for his son in his own room.  At this stage of the divorce, there's a decent chance that will be acceptable as an interim living situation in the court's view, although he may need to find a real two bedroom apartment in the future.

You should absolutely be able to have your own stuff but it looks like you're going to have to hide it better.

e5glyz,"NTA. She was forewarned about you staying up late and you also agreed to adjust brightness/sound if it bothered her. She agreed. If she’s getting pissed off now, telling anyone other than you is exactly why the problem isn’t being resolved. I’m not sure if there might be more to it from her point of view but to me it seems like you should casually bring it up, just ask if it’s okay you still being on the computer late now that she’s getting into an earlier routine.  

Now that she’s getting up earlier it’s possible that she could be hoping to go to sleep earlier, too, but is pissed off that you hadn’t thought of that yourself so that she didn’t have to ask you to finish up earlier."

e5in15,"I’m gonna go against the grain here and say NTA. It sounds like OP has talked to husband and he has been unresponsive, instead turning it around on her, saying “why would you be upset I’m helping someone else?” when in fact he’s NOT helping someone else. He’s forcing HER to help someone else, when she already has a lot on her plate. 

Additionally, what OP has described doesn’t sound like “whining” to me. It sounds like someone who is pointedly communicating their needs more effectively, telling DH that they are overwhelmed and need help when they do. And DH’s response to this is to accuse her of whining, when his real complaint is that more is being expected of him and he doesn’t like it. Just because husband calls it whining, doesn’t mean it is. 

I’m really disappointed that people are telling OP they need to go back to being a doormat in order to save their marriage. OP, if your husband only wants you as a doormat and doesn’t respect your time, your health, or your feelings, is it really your responsibility to make him happy and salvage the relationship? It sounds like you both need to have a hardcore conversation about both your needs and come up with a compromise. 

And yes, he may have been this way all along and OP was fine being the doormat in the beginning of the relationship, when they were most likely younger, had less going on, were basking in the light of the honeymoon phase. But as the years go by, marriage gets harder, people learn and grow up and realize their needs are important to their mental health. 

OP - it doesn’t sound like you’re whining to me. Husband needs to step up his spouse game and listen to your concerns without turning them against you and gaslighting the conversation to make you feel like asking for your needs to be met is wrong."

Control them, do not let the kids use them at 2 in the morning, make safe decisions about their internet use.. 

But if you decide your children's relationship with their father is somehow something you can legislate, if he isn't being abusive, just because of how the court decided the custody, you will be SHOCKED when you realize that your children don't CARE what you think, and want a relationship with their father. 

As it turns out, whether the ex-wife likes it or  not, the father is still the father, and attempts to actively work against him having a relationship with his children WILL backfire. 

(note: I am the ex-wife and Mom, and this is my approach to my child's relationship with his father, that relationship is  important even if my relationship with the man didn't last)."

Keep up the good work and tell that player if they don’t like the way you DM, show them the door.

Your wife is not a child. This is not about what you allow or don't allow. Your wife should have free rein to make whatever choices she wishes to make. Giving her ultimatums or commands about how should relate to Jenny is controlling behavior.

You are, however, correct that it would be best if your wife never talks to Jenny again. Why? because this relationship puts your marriage at risk. If your wife values your marriage, she should stop having anything to do with Jenny.

So, what should you do?

e5lcxy,"YTA. I understand getting frustrated but that was completely uncalled for. She is scared, frustrated, and hormonal. Have some empathy! 

A better response would have been ""I know you're upset and probably scared and I want to help you but I can't if you don't let me. Having an unsafe abortion is completely unnecessary. You could die! If accepting the money is the problem, then you can pay me back for the procedure when you have the money. Call the clinic, book an appointment and I'll go with you so you're not alone. You said you want an abortion, so this is how it's going to get done.""

Yes, she's being irrational and understandably making you angry because of it. Your anger is justified. How you decided to respond and react is not justified. You cannot control how you feel, but you can control how you react to it."
e5ldhp,"NAH

But I would suggest you broach this subject very lightly since it is a very sentimental thing. I mean you could say that you would rather have your wedding band be a simple one that you wear day to day and save the meaningful one for special occasions. I mean idk what you do professionally and as hobbies, but I’m and outdoorsy type. My wife and I have both lost or broken multiple wedding bands (none were sentimental or super pricey for this reason). She’s on ring #3 and I’m on #2. Hell one ring, she was driving home one day from work with her windows down and her arm dangling out, it was a little chilly but still nice, fingers get a pinch smaller when cold, and her ring just fell off into a grown over ditch (we live in the boonies). I imagine your fiancé would be crushed if you lost the heirloom with something silly like that."

I’m guessing if the books have personal meaning then they’re good ones and so reach out

 “I’m sorry for your loss, I know I didn’t know your daughter well but I’m glad that I managed to share my love of (insert author) with her before she passed. There’s one particular quote from a book I lent which really resonated with me so I wanted to share this with you (insert quote).

It's also worth considering reporting him to the police if he's like this , as verbal and emotional abuse is still abuse. Take recordings if you can to use as evidence, should you need it.

She may be planning for a time in which she may be financially dependent on her son. It is a bit old fashioned, not unreasonable.

She may want to plan ahead for the quite probable future in which her son has children and might just want to make sure that if he does pass that the kids are looked after. Again, old fashioned but not a bad thing.

A serious muscle injury will take a lot longer to heal than a broken bone. The muscle cannot be immobilised for a length of time like a bone can. 

Doing a simple chore like washing some dishes can very easily aggravate the injury, and cause the muscle to swell, resulting in pain. 

I have a muscle injury - my lower back on the left side. It’s been two and a half years and I’m only about half way through a recovery. 

Your roommates injury will heal, but it will likely take a lot longer than three months. I’d expect a full recovery in around 12 months. 

If he’s able to do a chore with one hand, then he can do that. He can put clothes into the washing machine and turn it on. He can take the clothes out and put them in the dryer.
He can scrub the toilet bowl with one arm, and he can put away dishes with one arm. 

But don’t push him to do chores that in all likelihood will just aggravate his injury and cause him pain.

Edit: According to what I’ve read, it will take up to six weeks for the labrum to reattach itself to the bone, and another six weeks to strengthen. After that, you have to be very careful not to stress the injury - being so recently healed means there’s a higher risk of reinjury."

Your teacher is right... but - 

**You don't understand what your teacher is doing. I can't fault you for that.**

You will end up in this situation in life.

There are things she can help with. If you stick with that mindset of you're the only one who can do things you will have a rude awakening when you get out there in the real world.

There are many people better and smarter than you.

There will be a day when you are the deadweight.

This is a problem I deal with in managing people - this is the solution: [comparitive advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp)

I know I can do things better than a lot of people on my team. Probably about 20 out of 25 of them ... but, I don't have the time to do the work of a team of 25 software engineers - I need to delegate. So, comparative advantage is the solution.

How do you apply comparitive advantage in this situation? You need to look at her as a resource. What can she do that she won't screw up - and will save you time to focus on the harder stuff. She will contribute, you will save some time, you can do more important things.

Resources? That means people. People are a resource. You are a resource, she is a resource. Your time is a resource. Use your resources efficiently and to the maximum of their potential.

Last, and maybe the most important- let her know you are putting your trust in her to do her part. You're counting on her to contribute. As long as you both do your part, you both get that good grade.

Trust motivates. (Of course, trust but verify. Never trust blindly.)

Do it. You have no idea how valuable what you will learn is if you pull this off. This is leadership. This is infinitely valuable.

**TL;DR: Be a leader. Help a person. You both will win.**

I’m in the same situation. Poly addicted brother who won’t get medical help, rehab or counseling for his addiction and mental illness. Mother enables him and gets heartbroken every time she thinks he’s gonna change. Heck my sister is going through this very same thing with her son the last 3 years and she can only empathize with my mother (her step mother), though she is trying a different approach she’s still making mistakes. Her son stole and wrecked her car after letting him back in her home after having kicked him out nearly a year.

Your brother sucks obviously.

Your mother sucks because she is effecting your life with something you really don’t want to be a part of. She sucks for enabling him but in her shoes she’s really trying to help him. But it’s hard to help when she’s being manipulated. 

You suck for basically telling her to give up and get over it. You have kids. You might say you’d do better... 

Though in my family the fathers try as little to be involved as possible while the mothers really want to fix their children and have them at least safe and know where they are and if they’re okay. I’m not saying you’d be one of these fathers but please don’t be one of these fathers if this ever happens to your future adult kids. 

It’s fair that you want to live your own life free of this drama, you have every right to, but as long as your brother doesn’t get the help he needs, your mother will never stop being effected by it. When your kids grow up they dont stop being your kids. One of her kids is very sick and fucked up and suffering with medical problems (addiction is a medical problem). Shes allowed to get upset.

Secondly, they could overdraft the account easily and that will hit your husband. If they overdraft it the bank comes for him and not the family. The same applies to the credit card.

I understand his desire to help his family. But he is putting himself and you at a great risk since his family is not good with money.

I also don't think it would have gone over well to march up to her and say ""you're too much of a burden on me right now, let's stop hanging out"". Adults often phase each other out and scale back on social interactions without needing to make declarations about it.

“A landlord cannot enter the accommodation unannounced. He or she is obliged to first knock or ring the doorbell, and wait until the door is opened.
A landlord is not allowed to visit the tenant at any given time. When the landlord wants to visit the accommodation, he or she needs to have clear and well-formulated reasons to do so.” 
Technically, what the land lady did seems to have been a violation of the law. While her intent may have been great in her own mind, I can completely understand how what may seem sweet to her would have had you running for the hills. The landlady was not your mother and had no right (as far as I can tell-if I’m wrong please correct me) to be in that apartment without your knowledge.

I very much understand where your parents are coming from: they're scared. Coming out as trans inevitably means a swath of challenges for your family, and feeling apprehensive about the runoff of those challenges is normal. Maybe even expected.

What they are overlooking, though, is how difficult it is to be closeted. It's far worse when you're trans, as far as I understand, because (and correct me if I'm wrong, naturally) you're confronted every day by well-meaning people who are using a name and pronoun you don't want, and you are constantly reminded that you're not living as yourself. Your parents' role right now is to protect and support all three of their children, and ideally that would mean finding a way to work together as a family to support your decision to come out and prepare your brothers for what might happen.

Be aware, though, that coming out will present challenges for you, too. The school may not be supportive (I'm not sure how well-protected you are in your area, so I can't really say), and you will want to be very ready before you take any steps. Make sure you're safe."

But not in the way you think.

You should have stopped the destruction in the first place. Allowing your friends to vandalize makes you complicit of the act. Who your friends are reflects on you. They are shits, which means you are shit.

Do you know why the school ""forgave you?"" Because it would have looked horrible if their valedictorian didn't graduate. If you weren't their top student, you wouldn't have been given this chance.

The only reason you care about what happened is because you were about to lose your ""honor.""

Truth is the world may thing you have honor, but you don't. Not because you ratted your friends out, but because you stood by and watched and did nothing. You only did something when you were threatened.

Pure speculation here, just my thoughts -

1. Your bf might be burned out from serving and want downtime in the evening. Or if he works at night he can't socialize the same way as folks with a 9-5.

2. Your bf might be struggling with depression or anxiety and isolating himself.

3. You want to expand his social circle?  Wonderful intention, but you can't force a friendship. You can say, ""Let's hang out with x and y people for a movie or game night."" and see how it goes.  (Something close ended.)  

4.  If he's being clingy, I would want to know - he's being controlling? Is he preventing you from seeing other friends?  If so, please carefully evaluate if this is healthy.  

If he sees you as good company, okay, but lay some boundaries. Make sure you take time with your friends / family."

Bringing up your niece sounds a bit hollow -- were you and your wife setting aside any money for you niece? Saving to help with her college or emergency expenses? Unless you were contributing financially to her upbringing I don't think you get to judge how her parents handle it.

Of course, it would be nice of him to do, that doesn't mean he's obligated to.

From what I'm hearing it sounds as though you aren't able to live freely in your own home because of your dad's temper. Regardless of whether your father is to blame, this is an awful situation to be in. It makes a lot of sense to me that you'd feel angry about that.

Brain stuff is complicated. I know that a lot of people who have Traumatic Brain Injuries, for example, experience difficulty regulating their emotions. So it isn't totally surprising that someone who has part of their brain removed would find it tough to remain calm when things don't go exactly the way they are envisioning, and it isn't clear to what extent your dad has any control over that. At least in theory and depending on what else is going on, your dad should still be capable of apologizing and acknowledging that things got out of hand, but these things vary person to person.

You are NTA/NAH (depending) for being angry at your dad. He isn't able to be there for you in the way you need him to be, his illness takes up a lot of space in your life, and it sounds like you aren't getting the chance to just be a kid and make mistakes and have fun. That doesn't necessarily mean you should act on that anger -- like yelling at him or telling him all the things on your mind -- but it's always okay to feel what you feel.

You have no idea if you are getting an inheritance and want to borrow against it, while the giver is still living?

There are plenty of domestic violence agencies that would help your gf. She needs to reach out to social services and explain the situation. Services are not just financial but can help her get counseling, even if it's just a social worker to talk to. She might qualify for a relocation grant to help her move into an apartment, as a one time only gift.

I'm sure our intentions toward her are good, but I'd never advise someone escaping a domestic violence situation to immediately move in with their new relationship. She's young and needs to discover herself and develop some independence, and a caseworker will probably be able to counsel her on that."
e6cyf7,YTA. If she specifically asked for it wouldn’t she kinda already know what she was getting since she asked for it for Christmas?

Once you guys know whether you're going to keep seeing each other, you could tell him you started listening to that music because you saw that he was interested and it piqued your interest.

Companies who ask employees not to discuss compensation are the AH - they are actively trying to prevent employees from understanding the compensation structure. If they have valid reasons for you getting less than others, then they should be transparent enough to discuss that with you openly.

A fucking judge ruled you would be responsible for her death. You don’t care though; her life doesn’t mean much in comparison to the dogs. That much is clear. Not only that, but you’re forcing your S/O into a fucking hotel every other weekend (don’t even get me started on the financial aspect) and you’ve considered moving out before you’ve considered giving up the dogs, so I guess you don’t care about your relationship either. I feel sorry for your baby; god help them if you ever have to choose between them or the dogs.

Edit: didn’t know about the stepdaughter being hidden when this was first posted. That definitely makes this a far more sticky situation than it appeared at first. Undecided about whether or not the OP is actually the asshole.

Edit 2; I’m going to go with YTA still. Unexpected or not, step or otherwise, a kid is a kid is a kid. And that kid will be in your life forever, regardless of biological relation. If your biological kid were to develop an allergy, what would you do then? What if it was yourself? Your S/O? It’s unfortunate, truly, that you have to give this up your dogs for the child but that kids life should still mean more than whether or not you keep the dogs. At the very least, shop the dogs around. TRY to find them a good home. If you try and fail, that’s a different story but if you don’t try you are definitely the asshole."

First off, yes your hubsand is an asshole for blowing up at you. Thats a mountain out of mole hill reaction but lets deep dive into his thoughts. Way I see it couple things are going on, one or all could be true 1) He thinks women should only wear ""appropriate"" clothing outside. I agree thats a controlling dick move, assuming you don't live in a place where you get arrested or anything. 

2) he is legitimately afraid for you cause he believes men are monsters and if they look up and see your nether regions it may alert the monsters to your presence. This is kinda shitty to put the burden upon you but at the end of the day its the monsters he is afraid of

3) he asked you to do a thing and you just ignored it and never expressed why you felt that thing was a bad ask. This would upset anyone and doesn't matter what. If you asked me to refer to you as Karen and I refused and called you Melissa that would upset you/anyone. 

So to me the real issue is you relying on your **inner** feminist an dnot your **outer** feminist i.e. you and hubs should discuss what the actual issue is so y'all can atleast know what the issue is. I think if men vocalized their problems they would better be able to process them and see how silly they are. Cause if he thinks guys might get a quick lookise well...thats rather insane isn't it? But doubt he has ever faced the  reality of saying this fear outloud."

e6k8e7,"NTA. His comment at the end just shows how awful he is. If he asked you to venmo him for your ice cream, just ask him to venmo him for everything you bought for him."
e6k8is,[deleted]
e6k8zh,"NTA. Dude, you need to get out of there like yesterday for your own mental health. Do whatever it takes, you come first in your life."
e6kap9,NTA. Technically the books are NOT still hers. Hindsight's 20/20 but that doesn't mean her friend gets the books.
e6kcbt,"NTA.

You didn't say 'Hey Prof. Please fuck my friend over.' or mention anything about your friend at all actually. You asked for your test to be relooked at and then the teacher realised his mistake.

Fuck all to do with you."
e6kchp,"Considering you said you’re a woman and this is like your sister, NTA.

This is someone you were close to for a number of years and if your brother isn’t uncomfortable with you being friends then I don’t see why he can’t disconnect from the fact that they were together. She should just be considered your friend and not your bros ex at this point.

If you would buy any of your friends a plane ticket or lend any of your good friends money, then that’s who you are as a person. It shouldn’t matter what your brother thinks."
e6kdk2,"NTA. It sucks sometimes but you can’t let bad partners ruin your grade for you for the sake of appearing nice.  Your teacher told you to boot them too. As long as you handled it graciously, I think you are fine here."
e6kgwp,"YTA

If it’s so close drive yourself. The tip is for the convenience they offer you."
e6kha3,"NTA You are all taking the class and she's distracting you by making comments about how gross things are, thus making it her business. You brought it up as a joke, but were making a valid point. If you want to have a job in emergency medicine, you should be ok with the sight of blood."
e6khsm,NAH- you *should* be honest with your friend. If it’s been 2 years already and she still cries over it every day- she prob needs some sort of professional help- therapist maybe. Friends unloading on us can be draining- which is why a therapist would be great- she can unload on them and get some professional advice at the same time.
e6klgh,NTA. FIL needs to keep his opinions about your body to himself.
e6kn9n,"YTA only because he’s fucking one, of course things confuse him. How else do you learn besides exposure and practice of confusing shit? Children are sponges and the more you expose them to the more they take in. Worst case scenario he doesn’t pick up on please and thank you, best case he does there is no harm in trying."
e6kpyh,"NTA, she's not a child, old people don't suddenly loose all sense of right and wrong unless they are really ill. Start talking back or you are gonna be a rug, and same with her children. You don't have to just take it."
e6kui5,"YTA, this this no different than a noise complaint. Your recreational activities are disturbing your neighbors. They shouldn't have to breath your second hand smoke just because you don't want to leave the building to get your nicotine fix."
e6kujv,"NTA. Imagine being so selfish that you could still enjoy a trip *knowing your presence is a huge imposition.* 

Your husband needs to push back, tell her to change the ticket, and impress upon her that it is **not cool** to plan stuff like this without asking first."
e6kv8t,NTA- she sounds hella flakey.
e6kvfg,"Sorry, but I think YTA in general. You aren’t thinking of your child at all in this situation. Divorce is hard on them and it would be nice if you all could be cordial adults for a Christmas gathering. I would hope your girlfriend could understand that it is one day where you can show your kid that they are loved by their family and that everyone can get along."
e6kwnk,"NTA

I think you probably need to do this incrementally.

Take him aside and let him know he's violating the spirit of the group when he uses dead names and inquires about sexuality in a personal way outside of group.

Let him know these actions aren't appreciated and if he continues behaviors like this he won't be welcome back."
e6l1d5,"NTA. From each according to their ability, to each according to their need, comrade!"
e6l3cx,NTA- there’s this cool theft powder that turns purple when you touch it. It reacts to moisture if I remember correctly. I would dust the bag with that and catch them purple handed.
e6lb2o,"YTA. 
Why’d you take the job in the first place? They’re being friendly to you and you’re gonna walk out just because you don’t have anything to do? 
Why don’t you talk to your friendly boss and stop ignoring him. That’s no way to act in a professional setting. Especially if you are really considering quitting."
e6lcff,NTA at all. This is not up to your FIL and you’ve made a really fair request.
e6lee2,"NTA but if you want to avoid this I future, I would suggest each paying $10 a month or something though to cover shared expenses like dish soap, toothpaste, toilet paper etc. That way all those really basic things won’t become an issue when it comes to sharing. Your roomate is in the wrong here though and toothpaste or not, it’s not right to take your stuff without asking."
e6lktx,"NTA, but what would you do if they refuse? I would seriously think about finding a new roommate."
e6lm2h,"NTA

You have a lot going on and it is perfectly reasonable to stay home and relax. It's not like you're stopping him from going."
e6lo82,"NTA. It's great that your parents have done so much for her, more than a lot of people would, but ultimately she's not their responsibility. At 18 she's an adult and it's time she started to think about looking after herself. It sounds to me like they're good people and as such they deserve to enjoy their twilight years."
e6loav,NTA Never ever put a shit minimum wage job before spending time with family. This is why materialism causes so much suffering.
e6lqoi,"NAH - No one is an asshole here, but her logic doesn't make sense even if the portfolio doesn't get her a better job, it will certainly put her in a position where companies are more willing to take a chance on someone without the normal expected level of experience."
e6ls1d,NTA. I have the same experience with my family and they also use the same excuse when i use bible quote against them. I think making your mother cry is unfortunate but you were just standing up for your own conviction so it's not really your fault. Apologize for making her cry but don't apologize for standing up for yourself.
e6lury,"NTA

Going out to eat is for you to take some time away from your desk /work and literally take a break. When you are responsible for ordering food for them, it takes away from your break time and it makes you responsible for their food. 

I wouldn't mind doing it every once in a while, but not all the time."
e6lvbe,"Going against the grain here with NTA .  And here’s why. Your mother did nothing while your SD abused you for years. He pushed her 3 year old grand child, and she did nothing. So on the off chance she talks him into letting her spend time alone with you and your family, can you ever really trust her to protect your child in her care?

Until she can really talk this out with you and recognize the abuse she has enabled, she isn’t a safe person for your child to be around. Your mother needs a divorce and counseling, but the odds of this happening are slim. Perhaps your ultimatum will be a wake up call for her. But until she can truly break free, your priority needs to be your child, not her or your SD’s hurt feelings.

Edit: misspelled word"
e6m1mf,NTA - sometimes you grow up and grow apart. i don’t think you would be an asshole whether or not you sent her a happy bday message but she might appreciate the thought
e6m2fc,"YTA. He’ll probably just think it’s cool and edgy and the point will be lost, plus now he’s got another lighter."
e6m52j,"NTA 

You’re paying the bill aren’t you? If you pay the bill you get a say period. I’d move out tbh because that sounds ridiculous and controlling. 

I’m pretty sure if they can pay the extra oil bill they can pay someone to shovel their driveway too."
e6m5wq,"NTA-. Joining in on a protest about something that you aren't protesting would be a more asshole move.  

 If you wanted to go with them to show support I'd make it clear that you aren't against the decorations, but feel that everyone should be heard.  But either way, they ( the Jewish girls) have put you in a tough spot and singled you out."
e6m8jl,"*Whaaaa ?* Why would he want to get a vasectomy reversed if not to have more kids? The, ""I feel less masculine"" excuse doesn't fly and has no basis in fact.

e6mat7,"YWBTA 

Right motivation, wrong execution

You're really not in a position to do anything with that intervention but piss her off. You would need to get someone involved who has some professional ability to help her and authority to demand she accept the help or face the consequences.

Your heart is the right place but you really don't have anything to actually provide her with."
e6mb6q,"NTA

RED FLAG! Dating a month, asking you 5x a day to see you, showing up *uninvited* when you need to leave for work? 

Run! That is really overwhelming and definitely not something you should ignore. He is not listening to you, he is acting way too possessive.

Nothing about this seems ok. Listen to yourself and dump him."
e6mkn5,"NAH (Wife or sister, boyfriend=asshole)

Don't invite him, but be prepared for the fact your SIL probably won't attend. And from the sounds of it, she will involve as many people as possible."
e6mlxy,"NTA, this is so bizarre. 3.5 is WAY too old to be breastfeeding, and if it’s to the point where he’s pulling practical stranger’s shirts down, there needs to be an end."
e6mm2e,"NTA.  I finally started doing things as well to a friend. 
I put up my hand and say ‘hold on, I wasn’t done yet’. Kinda awkward but just remember, she deserves it. It’s beyond rude 
My favorite is if she does it on the phone. I just start saying ‘hello? Can you hear me?  Oh ok cause I was talking and thought maybe you couldn’t hear since you interrupted’ lol"
e6mr4i,"NAH - the idea that it’s rude to discuss salaries only benefits employers. 

Anyhow, it’s a valid question and he gave a valid answer. 

I’m a professional artist and as a community we often discuss how much we make off of a work or a show. It helps us know what’s “reasonable” for art prices, and know which clients will try to get work on the cheap."
e6msog,"NTA, not your dog, not your responsibility but it sounds like you’re trying but your dad isn’t backing you up. If you can’t take care of the dog and you’re it’s primary caregiver, talk to your mom about rehoming it or at least get your dad to take up some responsibility regarding his dog. Your list of chores sounds extensive, especially if your siblings aren’t pitching in. You’re the eldest, doesn’t mean you’re the maid. Your siblings are old enough to do some chores and help around the house."
e6muho,"YTA

Gift giving is not about expecting reciprocation. It is about showing how you feel about the other person.

Learn to accept gifts graciously and to show thanks. Do not deny the gift giver their opportunity to express their love for you.

Also, don't stress out about match gift financially. Give based on what you can do. Good people will appreciate it. What matters is that you thought of them and got them something."
e6mwxh,"NTA. Play bitch games win bitch prizes. Do it anonymously and leave it to the profs to decide if they can tell of they cheated. It's law school not highschool. Cheating has consequences. This happened all the time when I was in engineering school. People got reported and they deserved it. If you do cheat and aren't smart enough to make it look like you didn't then you doubly don't belong there.

Edit. There's a lot of ""you have the wrong motivations"" in these comments. Motivations be damned. This is a social lesson about giving people a reason to turn you in. A lot of cops will let you get away with speeding 5mph, but if you flipped them off when you passed them they wouldn't. Learn not to give people a reason..."
e6mz7v,"NAH. There’s different levels of kosher. Can he just order a vegetarian meal where you go? That’s usually kosher by default if you’re basic kosher like no meat and milk in the same meal. If he’s requiring a place keep a kosher kitchen then that’s kind of unreasonable. 

Also there’s no reason he can’t join you and drink seltzer and cranberry on Friday. Maybe ask him what he suggests? He hasn’t crossed the line into being an asshole. He’s been kosher for ages and knows that sometimes it limits your options like a vegan person would. If he hasn’t asked you to stop or god forbid accuse you of being anti Semitic, he can feel a little lonely without being an ass. Also most places will sit one extra person who brings a bag lunch if there’s a whole crew of people. If there’s at least 6 of you and one person says they can’t eat there but wants to join, the restaurant would be an ass for not allowing that, especially if they can’t accommodate that person’s dietary needs. It’s not like he’s going in alone wanting a table."
e6n4fb,"> because M really likes him

e6n4l9,"I'm going to say NAH - we don't know her situation, it might be that she is homeless and that is the safest place for her to sleep."
e6n6rb,"NTA. I agree with Dad. Why can't your mom or your sister's baby daddy be the chauffeur? You work and have classes, what makes them think you have all the time in the world to play limo driver? Kinda sounds like you got voluntold but didn't want to put up a stink about it so you just did it to make everyone happy."
e6n8ca,"> Maybe our mistake was in telling people our plans to elope.

Facepalm. Apparently you and I have VERY different dictionary definitions of the word ""elope"" because the fundamental key to it is the secrecy. NTA, but you kind of opened yourself up to criticism on this one."

Don’t share meds like that, you’re smart not to. Your mom should go to the doctor and get herself checked out and get meds prescribed by a doctor for HER."
e6neql,"You're asking a depressed person to be friends on your terms, by giving them tasks that not only seem impossible, but add to the overall stress of the illness. Do some research and maybe find out what your friend *actually* needs. I'd rather claw my face off than go out with friends during a depressive episode, but it's also very hard to say no to the invitation because you're afraid your friends will abandon you. Like you did.

Yeah. YTA."

Your roommate is upset because of the ongoing issues with your cleanliness. It's crazy that you said it would be a surprise to your roommate just to do some dishes. These are little things that you should be doing all the time to keep up with the house, doing dishes isn't some big event. Living in a home with your constant mess has got to be frustrating to her. 

Your solution of calling a cleaning company is a bit insulting. Like instead of just picking up after yourself a little bit you're calling some service to come by so that they can clean the place and you can go right back to fucking it up again. Your roommate just wants you to do your part, and that involves actually putting effort in rather than having someone else do it for you. 

The fact that you called a service shows your roommate that you're not willing to change your messy behavior and that is frustrating. She's been communicative with you, and if she plainly said she needs some space you should just respect that."
e6ngt1,NTA- 8k is nothing to lose compared to tying yourself to a house with someone who is clearly not ready to commit to you. Walk away girl!

If he finds out you're not married and he makes a thing of it, he's TA for sure. But he hasn't done that; you're only speculating. There's no need to worry yourself over shit that may never happen. 

Right now, it sounds like both of y'all are just living your lives. He may have been having a bad day that time his face fell when he saw you. Or he may have felt intimidated cuz he likes you. Either way NAH."

e6o4vc,NTA.  I also had an abusive father although not has severe as your situation. I have tried to bond with him and he doesn’t seem to care but loves my siblings. I’ve decided that if my siblings were to come to me if my dad was sick etc I’d say sorry to hear that and have them deal with it.

See, you were polite and direct. Autistic people like direct because we can't take a hint. It doesn't sound like he was upset by the situation at all.

You:

1. Were speeding and lost your license as a result of that. 

2. Caused your parents’ car to be impounded and *they* had to pay to get it back. 

3. Decided to ignore the terms of your suspension and drive anyway, which could get you thrown in jail. 

4. Bought a new car, when that money should have gone to your parents to cover the cost of your mistakes. 

5. Are driving with no insurance. 

6. Yelled at your parents who are rightfully concerned and angry about the entire situation. 

I’ve never seen a more clear YTA post here. You are acting incredibly irresponsibly. You were (still are) driving dangerously. You’re exposing your family to financial and legal risks. You’re 21 and old enough to know better. Grow up, stop breaking the law, pay your parents back, and stop being such an asshole."

e6rin9,NTA. But uhhhh... do you need a niece? I’m very friendly and communicative.
e6rj1w,"NTA.  She made out with your girlfriend and is pissed at you for talking about it?  If she wanted her private life to stay private, she should have kept it so.  I get that she might have been confused and being outed before she was ready was probably difficult, but that's not your fault.  

Did she ever even apologize to you for what she did?"
e6rkjt,NTA- I don't think I even would have went to see her... I had to re-read ot a few times because she sounds like she is trying to be your mother... Is she normally such a r/nicegirl?
e6rkuv,YTA you know that shit is probably illegal
e6rkwz,"My goodness, *major* NTA. Of course you weren't asking for advice when you were literally telling him good news."
e6rw3w,NTA. Your sister sounds ridiculously selfish and self-centered. Stop showing her things you want for yourself.
e6rx82,ESH. You were also disturbing the peace and possibly making patrons other than the parents and their children uncomfortable.
e6s03k,NTA but alert her bank and possibly the police to come have a chat with her about internet scams. And maybe let Grandpa know not to give her anymore money
e6s087,"NTA. Once a gift is given, the recipient gets to do whatever they want with it."
e6s2qx,ESH.  Your dad doesn't get out of helping pay for his kids because he makes less or spends so much on alcohol.  Your mom is spending her money on weed and alcohol instead of making sure her kids have what they need.  Perhaps the weed and alcohol explain why she's not working as many hours.
e6s5io,"NTA x 1000

It is NEVER their place to use food as punishment.  You should go to the media about this - this can never be allowed to happen to your son or another child again.  For all you know, this COULD be common practice, and this is simply the first time anyone found out about it.  

You know what kind of nonsense goes on in schools.  Give 'em hell!"
e6s7co,"NTA, as a musician I can tell you it’s common curtesy to either put in a mute or turn of electric instruments after 10.  Just because we’re nocturnal doesn’t mean we’re allowed to play if it means other people can’t sleep"
e6s7g1,"NAH, but I understand how someone not versed in medical lingo could be taken aback. The ""asshole"" here is the hospital, and I suggest bringing up the optics of how that particular diagnosis can come across when read aloud to patients. Perhaps there can be checks in place to describe the diagnosis differently or contextualize it. Anyway, you were just doing your job - it would in fact have been unprofessional and inappropriate to omit it and not do a standard discharge."
e6s9cl,"NTA, always rearrange on graph paper and cut out sections for furniture first do that all day then move the real stuff once. Or else you end up like this. I mean how many times did you guys have to rearrange it in 2 hours before he was still unhappy?"
e6sbtp,"NTA. Once a gift is given, that’s it. Your friend doesn’t get to come back and put conditions on the gift later on."
e6sc9s,"NAH. I have friends where joking hard with each other is the norm, and sometimes a joke can rub someone the wrong way without you knowing it until it is said. Y'all handled it like adults. Maybe just avoid that line of joking in the future."
e6sdgy,"NTA at all!!!
Your parents sound dreadful. If you don’t have a lot of experience telling them no, start by eliminating your excuses/explanations. It doesn’t matter if your car is in the shop. 
“Oh, I’m so sorry but I can’t”
“Oh no, I’m unavailable”
“I think you might want to look for another sitter” 

Repeat a million times, in a friendly voice. I’m only suggesting the friendly voice because it sounds like telling them no is new for you and sometimes it’s easier to ease in to it. Good luck!"
e6sik9,NAH your health is just as important as his. tell his landlord about the bedbugs and only go over to visit him in designated bed bug clothes. it's not his fault he has bedbugs tho.
e6sonw,"NTA - and it may be worth it to take her to court for everything. This would be a great episode of Judge Judy. 

Also I’d say it’s safe to say her friendship isn’t worth it."
e6spfz,"NTA.

She said you were making your wedding all about you? Umm, that's the point, that day is supposed to be all about your and your partner.

It sounds like even if you invite her, she probably won't be able to come, so I don't see the harm in sending her an invitation.  Purposefully excluding her would potentially shut the door on any future relationship with her, and who knows, down the road you may wish she was back in your life."
e6ssw0,"NTA

Bullying is fucking disgusting.

Im not saying you need to do this but I'd draw a hard line with the manager (if I could afford it), because I would not want to work in a place that tolerates that sort of attitude."
e6sv72, NTA - And I’d block him.
e6swse,"NTA: coming from someone who has a reaction to the point of breathing issues its up to you guys about getting the cat and not your father.

- little side note if its really a full blown concern just keep one room fully cat free (closed door) and keep an air purifier in there that way its ready at a moments notice

- honestly i can't visit family or friends too long that has a cat, 15min is the max before severe symptoms start to kick in. so i get your dad's side but ultimately its about your guy's happiness"
e6sxze,NTA - she was being racist. that sort of behavior deserves to be pointed out
e6sy6k,Looking for more people to tell you you’re a great friend?
e6t43g,"Easy ESH.  ""i will shove thats statement so far up your ass..."" doesn't make you sound tough in any way shape or form.  Your groupmate sucks, but your reaction was out of bounds and only really comes off as a pathetic empty threat from a fake internet tough guy."
e6t5y4," Nta at all. Cremate her. There is no reason her friends couldn't meet at a park or a restaurant and chat about the good times, but you don't have to shell out for someone who wasn't part of your life."
e6tbzz,"NTA - Everyone has to respect reasonable boundaries. 

I had an acquaintance (lol, referred to as Star as well, funnily enough) behave in a similar way. It became exhausting and I started to expect all my friends to be bringing up issues about her anytime I went anywhere - as thats what happened. 

Banning her is the only option, you have given her chances and she has been warned. She is continuing to behave this way even though she is informed of the consequences. 

Good luck to you, its rough on the guilt dealing with situations like this."
e6tfov,"NTA, I would listen to your parents if I were you. You're at a vulnerable age and could be exploited by this person. Wait until you've got on your feet as an adult and keep your guard up."
e6tjn4,"YTA. Part of being a functional adult is learning when to channel Elsa and let it go. I used to be that person, who always had to be right. It’s exhausting for everyone involved."
e6tmlk,NTA there's no reason to let that person stay with you. They're a stranger. Your son is being an entitled pos. He's not being logical.
e6tmlu,"YTA. 

Joking is fun, and everyone laughs.  Cruelty, on the other hand, is not fun.  Not everyone laughs, because one person feels singled out.  

Also, just because something is true doesn't make it ""OK"" to ""joke"" about.  

Now, if you didn't *intend* to make your sister feel bad, then you can go and apologize.  On the other hand, the way that I read this, you harbor more than a little resentment toward your sister for skating by and not paying her way, so this may have been a way of ""getting back at her""."
e6tn4g,NTA nobody can order you to spend time on a vacation. They should be glad you're going at all if you don't like the woman.
e6tn5f,"YTA. Dude, I come in contact with doctors pretty regularly. If you aren’t making those connections, you’re only going to hurt yourself. When this gets out (not if because this is the type of behavior that gossip lives for) all you’ll be doing is outing yourself as someone difficult to work with, and making your life 20 times harder. 

Have you passed this idea by meddit? How did they respond to it?

Edit: I see you got a mediocre Step 1 CK, and your step 2 was one point above failure. Maybe your bad test scores combined with a not great attitude is why you didn’t match a residency?"
e6toe1,"YTA

Lying to your friend saying its Thursday and its really due Monday is a not the right thing to do.

I would be pissed if I was your friend who worked on getting the project done all night for you to say ""It's actually due Monday.

Even if he doesn't do his part, that's on him not you.

Edit: a word"
e6tp2f,"NTA, but if it would take” hours” to move the trampoline wouldn’t it be worth that time?  Also, aren’t those kids a liability on your trampoline unsupervised?  Moving the item seems like a small price to pay for safety, comfort and peace of mind."
e6tsn2,"NAH. But they aren’t wrong. Don’t open something that isn’t addressed to you unless the recipient has asked you to or given permission. Kinda mail 101.

Edit: I see it was addressed to you. It’s still a kind of crap thing to do since you obviously knew it was something for them."
e6tsu1,"If you present your complaint to management in a logical manner, they may very well understand and possibly take action... Honestly I don’t think anyone’s being a straight up asshole in this situation, however they did unfairly give out the prize. If I was in your shoes i’d definitely feel frustrated as well.

NAH - There are no ill-intentions, just a poor management of the prize. This could end up being a great scenario if management listens to the complaint."
e6tvpp,NTA. What a bunch of dicks.
e6tzw7,NTA what kind of psycho keeps unopened gifts in a closet for 6 months
e6tzwu,"Bro, I’ve slept on those uncomfortable-ass hospital reclining contraptions as has every other red-blooded husband with a pregnant wife.  I can empathize with you on that.

Let’s recap your story:  You WOKE UP your exhausted, overdue wife and TOLD her you were going home to get some sleep b/c this was all just too much for YOU. 

Going home to sleep when you’re exhausted does not make you an asshole.  However, given the circumstances and how you went about doing that- 

100% YTA"
e6u28z,Jokes about rape and assault are not funny. I don't understand why you think he's not an asshole. He's a colossal asshole. You're NTA.
e6u2ts,"NTA

I am virtually never in our office, so any work function is always an imposition, so I never attend. It's unacceptable to demand that a staffer take unpaid time out of their workday for a social function.

That being said, not going is clearly sending a bad message to your employer. Inconvenient though it may be, you may want to attend for the sake of your career development. Conversely, if you can conveniently schedule client activities that prevent your attendance,  you can beg off gracefully."
e6u53w,"NTA - You’re never obligated to touch someone or let them touch you. It’s ALWAYS okay to say no to physical contact that makes you uncomfortable. All your life people will try to push your boundaries...learning how to say no politely and firmly is a skill, and people should always respect no. Anyone who pressures you when you say you’re not confortable, including your mother, is in the wrong."
e6u974,NTA she willingly loaned you said item. Didn't even give it to you properly packaged. You packaged as best you could to drive it home. There's NO WAY either of you could've predicted a car accident. She needs to get over it. Don't loan out anything you aren't willing to lose. Period. Definitely NTA.
e6uaph,Nta. You’re being completely reasonable. Enjoy your day off.
e6ub8w,LED nightlights work give plenty of light without being a sleeping distraction.
e6ue5d,"If you feel that negatively about someone that you needed to say that, then I don't think you should be (or are really) friends. Which is totally okay, hang out with people who bring out the best in you, not the worst."
e6uedi,"Ugh NTA. If she’s calling you a bitch for not sharing your answers with her, she’s not a good friend."
e6ufmj,"NTA. Strongly consider accepting the full ride. I know you want to get out of your bubble but if it’s a good school and you are getting a full ride, that’s truly an excellent opportunity and something you don’t want to waste. 

Take advantage of any scholarship opportunities that come your way."
e6uja0,"NTA at all for not wanting them in your bed. So freaking weird.

A little bit TA for using ""I's"" to indicate possession.  (Just a friendly tease from a grammar nerd!)"
e6ujns,"NTA. Your family sounds horrible; spend Christmas elsewhere. Alternatively, buy a guillotine for the gift exchange and announce that this year you’re dispensing with the bourgeoisie.

Double edit: The best part is, it's a gift for the whole family!  (~~Except~~ *Especially* you, OP.)"
e6ul58,"NAH. I really think you're taking this the wrong way. Your roommate clearly thinks highly enough of you that she wants you to be there for her graduation. That's a pretty big thing. It doesn't sound like she's pressuring you to go. It sounds to me like she was just trying to get you information on how long it would be so that you could see if you could fit it into your schedule. If you don't want to go, just tell her something came up during that time, but that you won't be able to attend. Maybe get her a graduation card for when she gets back from the ceremony and a little treat or gift."
e6unhc,You might want to take a big breather. PPD can really screw with your thinking and judgment. Don't do it.
e6uq38,I would say NAH Bc 1) the cat needs to be on a diet abd you’re roommate can’t have him eating your cats food but 2) restricting your cats movement also isn’t fair. I think you should explore other ways of feeding the cats such as feeding at specific times (where your cat would be locked in your room and his outside) or a food bowl that releases food when the cat wearing a special collar approaches so it can’t be activated by his cat. If you did that he should pay for the feeder since it’s his cats problem
e6utyl,"NAH dude. Labor is sometimes long and slow and surprisingly boring, and you're only human. You will have to keep laughing it off though, because you're never going to live this down. Take it on the chin."
e6uzaw,"Maybe she found it creepy. No one wants sex talk from an uncle!

YTA"
e6v29p,"NTA

Taking your possessions and forcing you to share them against your will is controlling behaviour."
e6v2gx,That doesn't make much sense. Those women would still be allowed in due to being with a man. Frankly lesbian/bi solo women or groups of lesbian/bi women only would be less likely to cause trouble.
e6v82l,"Good god, YTA and I am PRAYING this is a shitpost. 

If not, then I struggled with mental illness all throughout my teens (that’s what those are btw, mental illnesses, not disorders)—and still do—and you sound like you’re handling all of this *really* poorly. Can we be hard to be around? Yes. But guess what? Your son is more miserable than you because he’s the one who’s mentally ill, unable to properly regulate his emotions, all while being a kid. He is your responsibility and you need to help him.

Your post sounds deeply resentful, impatient, and more interested in containing your son than helping him. Get him a therapist, get your own therapist who can teach you how raise your son, and stop acting like he’s constantly scheming and out to get you ffs.

And, guess what? You worry he might have issues with consent? *Then talk to and teach your child why it matters.*"
e6v9cl,"NTA - Justin could have gone to the store for you, and he could have helped you sanitize the tank. If he had cared about what's important to you, he would have gotten what was important to him."
e6v9ii,"NAH. Needing some distance from constant negativity is understandable. Don't tell her she's toxic or affecting your energy negatively in those words though. Maybe say it in a softer way - you could try saying that it's overwhelming you and while you understand how tough it is for her, it's more than you can handle everyday."
e6vbmy,NTA Supporting homophobic organizations is validating their views.
e6vezi,"NTA. She sounds so petty, wtf."
e6vjw8,"NTA but... it sounds like you’ve tried to get her to hang out far too many times with the same response. 

Don’t try anymore. Put the ball in her court and see how long it takes her to contact you to hang out. It’ll be hard but if she’s a real friend, she’ll make contact and stick to plans. Don’t waste your time on someone who isn’t giving you any of hers."
e6vkdj,"NTA – congratulations, you are dating a selfish child"
e6vlwq,"NTA, but you weren't bullied.  You were pressured, and probably unintentionally.  There's a difference.

Tell Ryan it's out of your budget and ask for another suggestion."
e6voa8,"NAH. Set up a timeline that is reasonable for her and for you for her to pay you back. 

If she seems like she doesn’t want to then she’s the AH."
e6vpuh,NTA. Quite the contrary. You were friendly. She should be considerate of the public space.
e6vr6a,NTA.  The cross became a popular secular piece of jewelry decades ago.
e6vuby,"YTA because sometimes plans change and adulting involves understanding that work obligations sometimes take precedence in order to continue providing. 

I can't honestly connect your comments about his haircut to your comments about the cabin. You sound really passive aggressive and petulant. Go to the work event with him to show your support and be proud of his accomplishments. Then take him to the cabin to celebrate privately. 

As for the haircut, it's just hair. Bad cuts happen. Guess what? It won't last forever, but the way you treat him over all this will certainly leave a lasting impression."
e6vx0j,NTA. Calvin and Hobbes is totally age appropriate for your daughter. I would talk to your wife and ask how she finds it inappropriate and go from there. Good luck!!
e6vxh8,ESH - she’s a bad mom. That was a petty post. Maybe y’all need a custody agreement enforced by the court.
e6vy8d,"YTA, your mum is right, its not your place. Why do you have to post all about it on fb? Sounds like you just want attention and to stir some shit up. Doing it literally benefits you in zero ways and just hurts people."
e6w076,Yes you’re the asshole. You can’t be kind to someone for the expectation that they will fuck you. You’re basically exploiting them for sex at this point.
e6w86u,Absolutely not. And you should tell them that when you do quit. NTA
e6watg,"NTA, but I'd just be honest. If they're so set on having expensive stag and hen dos, they need to be prepared that some people can't afford it. There's no shame in that. If they're angry people can't come, they're just being bride/groomzillas because, honestly, who puts the destination above being able to have fun with your friends?"
e6wbpc,"NTA- your mother's sperm donor effectively abandoned you. You owe him nothing as a father, because he effectively wasn't one. As you said, you feel bad as a person, so you aren't a monster. But you owe him nothing"
e6wcdq,"Tell them they have to also bring salads potato,  pasta,  and regular. 

Or tell everyone it's 25 or 30 bucks minimum spend and they have to confirm their choices with you first so you can ensure everyone's pitching in and covered fairly.

OR no one can only bring drinks everyone must bring food and one drink or one salad. Also to let you know which it is so you can be sure there's enough food and drink lol"
e6wfqo,"NTA at all, first off if he wants to hold you the standard of a ""real"" babysitter, charge $20 an hour, $30 for between 8pm-8am. Probably more for twins. Then he can have price of the book back, for repairs. Like i cannot stress enough that $40 for babysitting two days is nothing.  
But all pettiness aside, you did them a favor. He's T A if he thinks you owe him something."
e6wnmo,NAH - It's like idiots that leave their towels on gym equipment to claim it as their own. And then trot off to the other side of the gym to do something else for half an hour. You were there for a full hour before he got back!
e6woqu,"The whole text exchange makes me feel like I’m reading a soap opera, holy shit. 

Anyways, NTA. She honestly sounds crazy and frankly I wouldn’t want to associate myself with someone like her. You communicated your feelings to her in a respectful manner and it’s sincerely her problem that she’s not taking it well."
e6worj,NTA - i‘m sure there are other people who could help here and even if not she knew you were already late and i hate when family does this thing that only they are important.it‘s just petty and immature
e6wpi4,"NTA - what sort of company asks the staff to pay bonuses. Bonuses come from the company's profits, not from other staff."
e6wpqb,NAH. What you described is typical teenager angst. You think your family and the world doesn't understand you. I have been there myself. It's the chemicals in your body going a bit crazy. Don't worry. It's normal. Hang in there.
e6wrfk,"NTA

I'm just getting a kick out of this. I truly enjoy how much consideration you have put into something so small - it's a good thing!

I don't know how old you are, but mature people aren't going to stop being your friend over this if they are actually a friend. Just let your friend know your reasons and offer to share his playlist with him so he doesn't lose it if he makes his own account."
e6wwc7,"NTA. Believe it or not, women can move out of the way too! Whenever I'm walking next to someone (I'm a 5'3'' female) and I see someone coming up on me, I drop back to walk behind the person I was walking next to until we pass the person. It's called being a considerate person. If someone chooses to take up a ton of room on the sidewalk and not move out of the way when another person is approaching, they deserve to get bumped into."
e6wzl9,"ESH. It's not your place to demand they divorce, but it's 100% your place to refuse to subject your children to it. Maybe only allow them visits individually and supervised, then see if they can keep their complaints about the other to themselves?"
e6x392,"NTA - people who are your friend under the expectation that you will give them things arent really your friends. If that's the case, then you can find better friends. On the other hand, it could be that he misunderstood your refusal as you not trusting him, in which case NAH and maybe try talking to him about it again?

Also, for the sake of clarity, I think you meant lend, not borrow. It's a common mistake, but the person giving is the lender and the person receiving is the borrower. I knew what you meant immediately because I know plenty of people who speak english as a second language and they do the same thing."
e6x4sr,"YTA, cat pics are the best. Nah jk, but instead of calling her out in a bad mood you could've just said it politely. Ya know just like 'hey thanks for sending me the pics but I'm not that much of an animal person and don't really want them, no offense.'"
e6x6qe,NTA. It's your home. You get to decide who comes around or not. Just be prepared to see less of BIL for a while.
e6xham,[deleted]
e6xkjg,"NTA ... 

Though I would be moving out asap and considering this might end whatever relationship you do have w/ your father."
e6xm8t,"NTA 

She should have never talked to you.  It’s none of her business."
e6xndm,NTA if you poke fun at someone's obvious trauma what do you expect to happen
e6xs9h,"NTA and frankly, your boyfriend's being a bit of an ass if he doesn't even bother to like stand up for you."
e6xtym,"NTA your bf is gonna have to learn about women sometime. I walk around in my underwear all the time. Period or no. Thankfully my bf doesn’t make me feel bad about my period. When I’ve leaked through during the night a couple times, he’s been totally kind about it. During the day I obviously make sure to change my protection frequently, and like you I wear a tampon as well as a pad. Your bf is being immature and rude"
e6xuo1,"NTA. It will probably upset your dad, but you're not obligated to keep something just to make him happy. If it comes up, which it probably will, be honest with him. That's really all you can do. He dictates his own reaction from there and you're really not responsible for that."
e6y3h3,"NTA wanting to have the celebration at your house. 

But, you could always let your brother-in-law and sister-in-law decide since it’s their problem if their kids get upset? I don’t mean that to sound harsh. You’re trying to do something nice for them! But if they don’t really have a problem driving the extra 30 minutes then there is no problem.

Your father-in-law may be a little over the top here, and if you’d like to have the holidays at your house next year maybe start planting that seed early this year. It shouldn’t really matter where you are as long as you’re together. 

People get really funny (read: crazy) at Christmas time. It’s actually the most stressful thing about the holiday in my family. Everyone deciding who’s going where and when... and if you can’t make it to someone’s house they get offended. There’s only so many hours in a day and as time goes on and families grow bigger there’s more and more places to go. 

I’ve stepped back from going to a lot of gatherings. No regrets!"
e6y8a4,NAH but go over there with a plate of cookies and explain in a friendly way that their bright light is flooding your home at night and that you’re wondering if they could adjust it so it points more into their own yard. Letters can very easily come off as hostile.
e6yc0c,NTA. And I really strongly dislike your mother on your behalf.
e6yi2x,"NAH. There are no tickets purchased and you’re not leaving him in a lurch. Take the trip that *you* want. It’s your time, money, and holiday experience (and if you don’t really want to be there your lack of enthusiasm may dampen his enjoyment). 

Happy holidays and safe travels to wherever your final destination."
e6yomm,"NTA he was either trying to shame you, or being Pervy (or both). Neither of those things is okay in any setting. Report him."
e6ypvb,"If you don't like the scent that much, you have two options:
1) Gift her a nice perfume, saying it's a token of gratitude for taking care of your child. Or just as Christmas present;
2) Find another nanny.

Dictating her how to manage her life and what kind of perfume to use ain't one of them, imho.

BTW, NAH."
e6yqs4,"ESH. He definitely isn't acting in a way that you would expect your friends to act. I don't blame you for questioning your friendship with him. 

However, you waited until the day before the concert to decide that you no longer want to go with him. That leaves him very little time to find alternative plans."
e6yud3,YTA. You gossiped about him behind his back.
e6yvo9,"NTA but frankly this feels like a humble brag. Yeah, you’re doing the right thing but you already know that"
e6yvyt,"NTA. If he's just a FWB then it shouldn't matter that they cannot meet your kids. It's your choice, not theirs"
e6yz0g,You are NTA to calmly and accurately inform a business of bad customer service.  You always have that right.
e6yz54,"ESH  
\-your brother: his marriage ceremony was so expensive, that everyone, including your parents who he probably knew didn't have money, had to chip in  
\-your parents: they obviously do not know how to handle money. since you said they had options, could have saved up, if not for themselves, for their children. they bought gifts when your father lost his job, which is hella irresponsible  


\-you: living rent free, going to dubai, having money for going out, and still asking them for money when you know they can't afford.  


\-you sister: she good tho  


Seems like all of you had options to save money and not be in this situation. I don't think it's too late to start saving, things can always be better. You know - you live, you learn."
e6z3r3,NTA obviously. But shitty company rules. Such a waste of food.
e6z7yr,"YTA.  I think you are crossing the line from ""concerned parent who wants to be involved in their child's education"" to ""that control freak who never shuts up at the PTA meetings"" stereotype.   If you think your child's project was offensive, then you can discuss it with them/correct them at home.  

Also I don't think your concern about them thinking slavery/civil rights movement is all there is to african american culture is valid - especially with young children, it's only natural to focus on the big historical things, and the rest will be filled in as they progress through school.  You can't condense an entire culture completely/accurately into one project."
e6zh9l,"NTA, I lived with my boyfriend throughout college like this but I only did it with pre-approval from his roommates. (My parents are ""traditional"" and wouldn't let me sign a lease with my boyfriend). I also contributed to the bills of that house. You however didn't sign up for this. She is free to bring her boyfriend over and spend the night, but he can't live there without your permission. Are you renting? Most leases say you can't have a visitor for longer than 2 weeks so maybe you can look into that and bring it up with her. Otherwise I would ask her if she can designate only 3 nights a week with him there or something. You deserve to have that space the way you want just as much as her."
e6ziqr,"NTA

Your roommate promised things that weren't hers and felt it would be just fine to take what she wanted without asking.

If she doesn't apologize, it's time for a new roommate."
e6ziu1,"NTA

This is the future she chose with her actions. She needs to learn to live with the consequences.

Going forward, your kids will be splitting holidays between parents. That's just how it is. She has no one to blame but herself.

Stick to your plan."
e6zrfs,"NTA it is sometimes easier to test the reaction of strangers, so we can gain strength to tell the others in our life"
e6zt41,"NAH. It bothers me that your concerned with rent instead of rehab but I can't call you an asshole for it if he agreed to pay half in 1st place. 

In situations like this, I always wonder did you move in a partner or did you want a roommate to help with bills?"
e6zxd4,"NTA at all. Your request of a non-band/gaming related shirt 5 days a year is *totally* reasonable. Hell not even that, you sound like you're even fine with certain video game shirts on those days.

e6zzqf,NAH - but I think you are a kind person for worrying about this.
e700zg,"NTA for not donating, but you might want to take your own advice about going somewhere else if you're that salty about your current compensation.  (And if your reaction is ""it's not that simple,"" maybe think about why the cleaning staff might feel the same way.)"

e704pz,"NAH - you should be able to joke about whatever you want.  Just know that when you joke about things that are very spiritual and important to certain people, you may very easily end up offending them. Know who your audience is when you make jokes about things like religion. And if you do offend someone when you did not want to, and you feel bad for it, its very simple to say that it wasn't your intention and that you're sorry for having offended. Normally that can smooth things over on all sides"

She gave you a car. Meaning she purchased it, fronting you the money.

You are entitled to nothing, really. Her giving you the $500 is more than what you deserve (you think you deserve money for maintaining your vehicle that you drive...)

They probably wouldn't be reacting like this if you hadn't corrected them pretentiously in the past. It's annoying to have someone correct you sanctimoniously about the pronunciation of a word.

e71gzj,"NTA - You cant agree to a deal then decide 5 months later that it doesn't make sense.

If he had come back after an hour or a day then I would be more inclined to suggest having that discussion, but 5 months is way past the figurative 'return' date."
e71h54,Are you cancelling because she won't leave for the night? It seems like YTA here for asking her to move in and then asking her to leave for a night as if she doesn't share the place with you. This is equally her space and you can just be considerate of the fact and maybe be the grown adults you and your friends are and behave as such.
e71ic4,"YTA, of course.  Why would you even imagine it's acceptable to do this?

If the old brewery had encouraged you to throw the pint glasses on the floor when you needed a refill would you have done that at this new place?  Of course not.  What the old brewery did/allowed doesn't mean anything.  They're two separate businesses and the manager should have tossed you out."

e71lmj,"NTA. I know this will get downvoted into oblivion, but your sister already had her PPD (pretty princess day). I understand and totally get vow renewals, but they are not second weddings. Personally, I think wearing a wedding dress to a vow renewal is gauche because you already had your day and now it looks like you just want that attention again. There are plenty of gorgeous dresses out there specifically for vow renewals. Had it been her wedding, I would have voted differently because I think in that case, you should have run it by her before you bought it since you both liked it. But she's mad at you for wanting a taste when she's looking to take two bites out of the apple."

I'm prepared to be down-voted, because this sub seems to hate it when you call the person who was an AH in response to an AH an AH.

The manager is OBVIOUSLY TA, and he was TA first. However, in your account, you say you left your aisles in a condition that is ""borderline unsafe,"" and that you shouldn't have taken it as far as you did. That's what AHs do. I do understand your reaction, but that doesn't change the facts of it.

What you could have done is asked AH Manager for an example of shelves stocked to his liking, and just done your job. You like how big mart did things better. I think I would too. But now you work for small mart. You can do things in their messier way, without setting up unsafe conditions (and without setting the scene for non-injurious disasters), but you chose to go full AH. Just own it. We're all AH once in a while."

e72dcn,"YTA because you were aggressive in your first contact. 

You called them rude and ignorant even here, where I presume you've tempered your actual words for the retelling. Your first effort with neighbors should be even-keeled and request-based instead of accusatory and demanding. 

Let your wife handle these conversations if you can't help but approach like this."

And your comment about an old affair she JUST found out about? Seems like a legit concern to not want you to have illegitimate children. She's obviously still hurting from that news and now knows the potential to cheat again is there since you did once. 

Do you not realize what her body went through, TWICE, to get your wonderful children here? And the ablation procedure isn't a walk in the park either. I think going through with a vasectomy is the least you could do at this point to A. Give her peace of mind and B. Show her you can and are willing to keep promises, especially since you cheated. Have you even discussed with her why you don't want to do this now?"
e77ywu,"I’m gonna try to save you a whole lot of trouble though it probably won’t help: what you see is what you get.   


You’re marrying him.. hopefully you like him enough to put up with his flaws. If that means socializing separately some of the time then so be it. If you can make friends first and then bring them into a joint social circle, that would be good. And maybe you can develop some techniques to help the social situations go a little better — instead of moving around and grabbing plates, try to launch into your own story that involves a situation that everyone can relate to.   


But asking him to “tone it down” and telling him he has to “practice his talking” is only going to lead to his hurt feelings and your frustration. YTA mildly for going ahead with that"
e780my,"This sounds like a butt-out situation. It sounds like you eat some meals with her and she is not comfortable with you. You have literally no idea what she eats the rest of the time.

At my last secret Santa everyone else got personalized gifts and cool stuff that related to them, while my Santa got me cheap slippers and a fake leather wallet (neither of which I have ever indicated I cared about)... that still had the clearance stickers on it. The person just bought whatever was cheap and threw it in a box, and I was super disappointed. I put a lot of thought into what I got for my giftee, and my Santa just didn't give a single shit.

So, no. I don't blame you at all. Getting a giftcard while everyone else gets personalized cool stuff sucks."
e78dsu,"NTA -- And be wary of any guy in 2019 who says he wouldn't feel like a man if you showed him appreciation and affection in the form of a gift.  That he employed a full-on double standard doesn't help his case.  This kind of thing seems relatively benign when we're talking Christmas gifts.  But it more often than not has much deeper implications the more you two become invested.

I'm not going to go down the list, but I'm not exactly starved for masculine duties and traits.  Never would my sense of manhood be threatened if my wife decided she wanted to go the extra mile treating me."

Lots of people are bad at parking (not saying that you are, just in need of a little correcting). When I see someone parked poorly (outside of or super close to the lines) I just don’t go near them because there are always other spots. Especially since there were a lot of other empties near you and you made an effort to isolate yourself from other cars. If he was trying to “teach you a lesson” that would make him a bit of an ass IMO. I drive 12-15 hours a week and have accepted that 80% of people are just terrible at driving  and cannot be taught by me or anyone else on the road 🤷🏽‍♂️ (again, not that you are, just speaking generally!)"

You know from your dad's attitude that you will likely be unable to go to him for help of any kind after you are 18 you may even be kicked out when you are 18. These are realities you need to start preparing for now.    

- Tell family who might provide support, your mums side and those sympathetic to you on your dads side. 
- deal with your issues now through professional therapy. your school, if it doesn't have someone itself may have a list of resources young people like you can access free of cheap. you can also ask professionals in the area or look stuff up online. 
- look at getting a job asap, get some money saved up    
- look for resources in your area for job search help, food, bill, rent, housing assistance, things of that nature. Ask at every place if they know of more resources, many small local nonprofits may be hard to find through things like google

If you don't want to be around the guy, don't.

But it sounds like he is habitually being mean. As much as I don't like to immediately say 'cut and run,' it might be for the best."
e79n8g,NAH you’re trying your best and I can only assume so is she. She may be a little bit rude with her approach but she does have a point in wanting the work done.

I moved out at 19 for similar reasons with my parents, and honestly my moving out has done wonders for our relationships!

You're an adult! If you can afford it, move out and get some distance, but don't sever the relationship! Be thoughtful and still spend time with her if you can."

Also, hosting a party can be a lot of work, so you could use that as an excuse if she's being too much. (Like, ""hey excuse me for a second I have to go get more drinks for everyone"" or something.)

If you don't invite her, just don't rub it in her face, and be prepared for her to maybe get upset if she sees it on social media. Again, it's your party though."

I think Sarah is kind of right that 2 months is early but I don’t think she should have said anything it’s not her life. But you were saving up this insult in your bank to use to ‘get back at her’. I would say be an adult and just be direct in conversations but you aren’t adults yet and I doubt you would do this
e7a077,"Gentle YTA. I don't think she's wrong to want to wear jewelry from her first wedding to her second one. If she was divorced I'd say that was a little odd, and you might be right to have a problem with it. But she may just be trying to bring the memory of someone she loved - and lost - with her on this new journey, by wearing the same jewelry. It doesn't mean she doesn't love you. 
You do sound a little jealous of a man who's dead and gone. Might wanna work on that."

e7a21o,"NTA - there is a fine line to walk when talking to parents about their choices for their children.  Since you’re babysitting and helping out I don’t think it’d be wrong to kindly and tactfully bring up diet.  Saying “you guys feed your kid awful food” won’t go far as parents will get defensive.  

You could say something like “I haven’t been eating enough vegetables, what if we tried to work some different stuff into all our diets this week, I think (kid’s name) would really like it.”"
e7a2qk,"NTA - you should just contact her and tell her about your loss. It would be women to women conversation about loss. It is very possible that others in the family have suffered a loss too.

e7aapw,"NTA.

It’s tough for transgendered people today in our climate, especially when it comes to family members accepting them.

But your father (still your father by birth) needs to understand you went 17 years knowing him as DAD. She was DAD. She can’t expect you to at the drop of a hat change all that. On top of that, her partner is trying to push that and IS being manipulative by messaging you that. They’re trying to guilt trip you. Your brothers reaction seemed over the top but you were not. These things take time and your father needs to understand what she erasing with asking you to call her “mom”

Edit* fixed pro-nouns"
e7actt,"NAH. You tried to get your partner's approval, and thought you had it. If he feels differently, he should have said something when it sounds like he was consistently given a chance.

If she doesn't wanna let you know there's a ""guest"", which mostly appears to mean stranger, she shouldn't expect your to go out of your way to greet them.  They are her guest, not yours; you are not the host.  It's her job to entertain them, or ask you to come say hi if she feels you need to.  


That said, you'll never convince her of this, so it might be easier to just go greet them until you can move out."

e7b5rk,"NTA - He seems like he’s doing this often and like he’s planning to do it in the future as well since he’s talking about “the next time”. Him planning on getting plastered and not being able to care for himself is NOT your responsibility. I would consider this a warning sign. People who can’t hold their liquor and people who can’t stand being responsible for their own actions rarely make good bf material. If you guys set the rule this early, that he goes out and get smashed and you have to stay home sober to be his chauffeur whenever he feels like getting his free ride home, it will never change. Nip it in the bud! I’m not telling you to break up with him, but you need to clarify what the hell is going on before it gets worse."

e7bm0q,"NAH, but since you're only staying on weekends I would have thought it made more sense to just leave your sheets on for a few weeks and change them if/when a ""guest"" needs the room. I do think you should probably just change the sheets as asked, because if you're sleeping on a thick blanket the blanket itself will need to be washed as often as your own sheets would."
e7bowq,"NAH, just a lot of early-teenage-drama.

Friends are allowed to have different opinions on some topics.
On the other side, they are also allowed to have feelings, and your friend is clearly feeling hurt.

Generalizing (such as ""boys are cowards"") is never a good idea, as it rarely is true and it can lead to hurting other people's feelings. It can be a joke, but even then you need to know your audience.

She being hurt about this whole story is understandable but she seems to be overreacting, but it would be a really bad idea to tell her so.
Just try to find her during a calm minute and talk to her again. Maybe tell her that you also feel a bit hurt by her comment, she will probably be able to empathize with your feelings if she can't understand reasoning."
e7brlu,You’re definitely NTA! If you’re not asking for the kid to come to your house and you didn’t consent to taking care of the child there isn’t any reason you should have to. If you mom needs alone time maybe she should have thought about that before brining the kid to her house.
e7bv78,"NTA. Tell him, straight up. He would probably be more mad if you'd kept it from him. No good person would ever cheat - your friend deserves the backlash. They might dislike you for a while, but in the long run, he'll thank you.

""If it might hurt in the beginning, but will be beneficial in the end, speak the truth."""
e7bxsf,"Your friend is probably embarrassed that she felt singled out in front of your friends and so is turning it back on you so that she doesn't seem like she had the problem. I wouldn't give it a second thought. It's happened, move on. I wouldn't overthink it. I wouldn't mention it as you'll be going into difficult territory where you say something you regret or makes her even more upset. If she confront you, just say I'm sorry you feel that way and leave it at that."
e7bxvv,"NTA.

But I would brush it off. This would only be an HR thing if you actually worked with her and she was abusive at work. But this just sounds like a drunk person at a party.

I saw someone else said to talk to her about it. I absolutely would not do this. What would be accomplished by talking to someone you never interact with? If you actually get a job there AND you end up working with her, then maybe address it then. 

Otherwise this is all just hurt feelings."
e7bztj,"I actually think YTA, despite the obvious outcome being the opposite,

Hear me out, the way you're describing your relationship with her doesn't sound like you actually do have a crush on her. It sounds like you're worried you are going to develop one.

So hear me out, stop talking to her. 

If you all you do currently is ""snap back and forth"" you're not exactly the biggest part of one another's lives, and by continuing to speak to her knowing full well you may end up falling for her you do yourself, your ex AND her a disservice, all you will achieve is drama. 

So yeah,

e7c4gq,"NTA - And incorrect, it’s your baby with your boyfriend. It’s for both of you to calm the baby. If his part in that is to tell his friends, guests in your home, to shut the fuck up for 10 minutes then he should of done that and supported you more."

As an introvert, I love time to my self also. However family is family, and I do make sure there’s times for them. Even if I don’t get much from it, they do. So I’d say it requires a sit down talk. Explain how you feel, but recognise their feeling and views. Find a middle ground where you get to spend your time doing what you like, while maybe also agreeing to have time aside to do things with them."
e7ccta,NTA. Your post is hard to follow. From what I understand you wish to move in with your girlfriend. You believe she should pay rent at half the price or a proportional value. However you have oresented a cheaper alternative for her by purchasing an apartment. She just doesnt want to pay you rent if you own the apartment just her share of the bills. I would disagree with her on this. That is not a fair arrangement.
e7cetp,"NAH. He’s excited, a riff doesn’t take long to play. And he wants to share his progress with you. Which I think is really sweet cause it means you’re important to him.

You want to study and be left alone for your exam which is also fair.

You’re brothers. Sort it out."

e7cmj7,"The only thing you are guilty of is being unassertive. Did you even try to explain your side to the teacher? 

Even if it is months later, you should still talk to this teacher if you still have class with them. Maybe there’s something they can do to adjust your current grade. If you don’t stand up for yourself, no one else will. So definite NTA"
e7d3sc,"NAH, but it does sound like rather than helping your friend, you're enabling him to live off other people. If he can't afford gas, he can't afford a car. And if he had the money for a car, he had the money for rent and chose not to spend it on that.

How long do you anticipate this set-up continuing for?"
e7d41f,"NTA

She's a manipulator, leave her."
e7dc3z,"You've told your mum you'll be ""around"" on Christmas, yeah? Well if you haven't specifically said ""I'll be there on Christmas *day*""... You've got an out excuse.

You should absolutely visit your girlfriend on Christmas day. She'll be really upset if you don't.

YWBTA if you don't. But you will be disappointing one side, but if you're smart with the dates and times it doesn't have to be a *crushing* disappointment."
e7delp,ESH fucking teenagers just carry on in a few years the world won't be the same for you
e7dexw,"NTA-  If it would have been many hours before you were supposed to go out with your buddy then maybe. But it was an hour and half before, that would have been rude. I encourage my boyfriend to have time with his friends. If I would have canceled and told him to make other plans, I couldn’t or wouldn’t be mad if I felt better and changed my mind. I wouldn’t of even asked him to cancel."
e7dhg1,"NTA   
But you may have been a bit tactless.     

IF you want to help this friend you should do so at a time other than your own work out time.   
Tell him your own workout is very well defined and timed and doesn't include time for interaction. Say that if he wants to learn how to workout it needs to be at a time other than your own workout window.    
Tell him to be there right around the time you are done and you will get him started. Assign him treadmill work then go on your way- once he learns how to work it you don't need to be there to hold his hand.  
Next time assign him a free weight task and get him started.  Next time get his set up on a machine. Give him ten minutes after your workout is done and get him familiar with things.  

Point is you can help him without compromising your own schedule if you don't try to accomplish both things at the same time."
e7dn7c,"NTA, you set up some boundaries and *politely* requested her to follow them, so you then tried a little harder, when that didn’t work you just reminded her that you set boundaries and want them to be respected, next time I would try asking her how she would feel if whenever you wanted you would just up and enter her room and disregard *her* boundaries."
e7dvft,"YTA, You’re completely glossing over the fact that the person that didn’t keep their mouth shut is you, not your mom. You were the one that was trusted with a secret and blabbed. She’s not wrong to be concerned especially since she’s hearing about the hospitalization  from a third party. Keep your secrets better."
e7dwsq,"NTA because you found out you were pregnant after giving the go-ahead for him to put his name in. This should have been a discussion when you found out about the pregnancy, rather than him dropping the bomb on you. But yeah, having him go away for two months right after you have birth is not ok. 

It’s necessary to adapt your dreams to the reality of your life. I hope he doesn’t act resentful towards you, I would try to have some conversations about improving your communication and moving forward as more of a team than you currently are."
e7dxaj,"NTA - you’re 15. I think it’s amazing you’ve found a way to earn money. No one should expect a 15yo to contribute to bills. The fact that you pay for coffee/ meals is above and over IMO.  

It’s your money. Great that you’re saving it, but also you shouldn’t be pressured to (but it is smart!). 

Only thing would be is if your family is struggling for money, I could see how they’d appreciate contribution. 

Unfortunately other than having a sit down chat and discussing it, I don’t have any suggestions of how to resolve the conflict. Apologies."

e7e82w,"NTA, but you would do better with legal advice. If there is a will there should be an executor handling the estate. Or you may not have heard anything from the executor because the will is in probate.

If there is no legally valid will then it depends on the local laws for who inherits. However if things were jointly owned they would generally go to the other owner (so if the house and bank accounts were jointly owned with his GF, she simply continues owning them)."

This was an easy open and shut case!"
e7eqvx,NTA obviously. People should be more afraid of misinformation.
e7excm,"ESH. You shouldn’t be claiming to be Jewish, and obviously racist old ladies suck.

e7frkb,"ESH but step daughter is TA. SD needs to stop thieving and pull her shit together, but to make her move out for eating in her room is an overreaction (but understandable to make her move out for stealing, my point is not that she shouldn’t move out, but the fact that you list eating in her room as a reason). Mom needs to put her foot down and act as you two agreed towards SD, communicate with you."
e7fs18,"NTA - when you’re dead, you’re dead. Who cares what happens to your remains.

e7fwxc,"NAH.  Your BF was upfront at the very beginning that football was going to be more important than you or anything else.  You chose to ignore that because - let's be honest here - you thought he was joking or that he would change.  Now that you've discovered he wasn't joking and isn't going to change, you've realized how much it sucks to be a partner to someone who thinks football is more important than you.

He's being reasonable because he told you about this in advance and is being absolutely consistent with what he warned you about and you agreed to.  You're being reasonable to not want to be with someone who will always choose to sit and watch football over you.  So neither of you are assholes, but you're also not a good match for each other since you clearly want different things in a relationship."
e7fy9u,"NTA  
You cannot sacrifice your team and your department for one person who is actively working against the department, you, and ultimately the company.

e7g6dn,"NAH. You definitely shouldn't feel too bad about not really being up for it that one weekend, that's totally understandable and justified. But it also makes sense for her to be a little bit disappointed as it was her birthday, but no one is really in the wrong here."

You completely misunderstood what she meant when she said, ""We're all the same lying down."" It was not even a dig at you. She means that height difference doesn't matter that much.  You insulting her in response to that doesn't even make sense, let alone jabbing at her greatest insecurity when she was trying to make you feel better about yours. That's so awkward that you said that."
e7gsr5,"NTA for reporting facts.  Just do two things here. One, make sure your comments are anonymous and contain no identifying information so as to not harm your own educational prospects.  Two, stick to facts.  They are more relevant to the situation and more helpful for the person reading the evaluation.  Knowing a student feels a Prof has anger issues isn't helpful.  Knowing a student reported they witnessed a Prof yelling at students, and physically attacking an object in anger, that's quite another."
e7gt18,"NTA

You wouldn't be an asshole, but I think it wouldn't be a smart move to provoke a guy with a history of abusive tendencies (sorry I snooped).  You're in a really shit situation, and I'm sorry.  I hope you find a way out."
e7gt6s,"NAH eviction was bound to happen for them. Everyone gets evicted from their rentals, either by themselves or from their landlord.

e7hkn7,"NAH. Your dad probably thinks he’s doing the noble thing, but in fact, he’s being incredibly selfish. When family courts make custody decisions, they consider what’s in the best interest of the child. The crying shame of this is that both divorced parents believe that it’s in the best interest of their child to have that child live with them. You need to have a gentle discussion with your father and be honest about the reasons you don’t want to live with him full time. Seems to me you have good ones."
e7hnpv,NTA some people never wear underwear this is actually very common. especially with leggings

e7i23a,"ESH. He makes derogatory remarks about his brother, shares filthy shit with you guys, and is in general disgusting in public. You, rather than telling hijm to knock it off, lowered yourself to his level with equally disgusting shit, and made it borderline incestuous. Like, I don't know ANYONE who talks about explicit sex moves with their siblings."
e7i64n,"NTA (putting aside the “slutty” comment for a second) because this girl is NOT a nice person as you claim. She continues to do things that she knows will hurt the people around her like sleeping with that girl’s recent ex or making out with an engaged coworker. She knows those situations will upset other people but she continues to engage in them anyway. So that makes her an asshole.

You however, should reconsider your wording here. The problem is not that she’s being “slutty”. She’s being a bitch as I said above. But you have no right to judge her one how frequently she has sex because that is her own choice. The issue isn’t how often, but who she chooses to hurt in the process. Women should be allowed to have as much sex as they want without being shamed."
e7i7w8,ESH...you shouldn’t play guitar in a dorm room and he shouldn’t sing loudly all the time. What you really need to do is complain every single time you hear him. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
e7i9qr,NTA - Obviously not. The other family didn't have the money in the first place.
e7ib3s,NTA you already tried to help him. He had to learn at some point to check over his work to make sure everything was correct.
e7ijaz,"NTA  
He clearly needs professional help if it's causing him so much distress and he talks about it everyday. For him to expect you to be his therapist is just too much. You are not an asshole for setting boundaries."
e7ikhq,"NTA but I think you have a sorta flawed understanding of fat acceptance.

> I know fat acceptance is a bullshit and you shouldn’t encourage someone to tolerate their harmful lifestyle, but it does affect me.

Fat acceptance isn't encouraging people to be fat, it's exactly what you are asking for, not being shamed for simply existing. Your weight isn't his concern and then next time he brings it up you are well within your rights to call him a jerk. He should mind his own damn business. Thats not you ""accepting"" yourself as fat, it's telling him being openly rude to you isn't okay."
e7inom,"NTA. 

I have a similar issue with my FIL. He’s a big trump supporter and goes off on these anti immigrant rants and then points to me and says “not you of course, you’re one of the few good ones”. Yah, fuck that and fuck him. I don’t spend time around him and my wife is perfectly fine with that."
e7io1v,"YTA. It's not a joke if the other person is crying, it's bullying."
e7ipzx,"I mean, NTA, you can refuse to see your family if you want. But if your daughter really has panic attacks by just mentioning family get-togethers, and is really struggling with depression and anxiety, she needs to get professional help. Avoiding situations that give her anxiety or induce panic attacks isn't going to help her in the long run.

Edit: and just to clarify, you're doing a good job at standing up for your daughter. It's wrong of your sisters to not even apologize to her. I'm mostly worried about how she's starting to get anxious seeing her father's side of the family."
e7isyh,"NAH - this is a good time to educate them about consent and personal boundaries. Plenty of girls/women value their personal space and don't want to be touched. 

I get that their just kids though."
e7iukp,YTA again for blaming the victim of harassment for her own harassment.
e7iv6e,"NAH... But have you asked her if she wants to go anywhere with you? Maybe she'll surprise you... Maybe she will just want to go to the mall, which one day a year won't really hurt you... Or maybe she will say she doesn't want to, and you won't have to worry about being the asshole."
e7j0rt,"Personally, I say NTA because it's my opinion that  adults who get sulky or upset about gifts are fucking *weird*. A little thing for the person hosting can be a sweet gesture but being expected to show up with a gift for every adult present is bizarre.

That being said, different families have different traditions and expectations so if your partner says it should happen, then you should probably follow his lead, or be prepared to face the social fallout."

Going to one event and then bailing on the other because you don't like your coworkers makes YTA.  Also you are TA for exposing your orchestra to the flu."

In about five months start looking for a new place to live."
e7jabh,"NTA. 

But here, you dropped these 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

Figure out your shit with your boyfriend before your kid is born because it's not going to get easier. You're not freeloading, you're having his child and he should be helping to support you. Yes get a new place when you can, but for your boyfriend, supporting someone you love who's carrying your child at little to no impact to yourself is a low bar. 

Sit down with him and calmly figure out how to resolve this conflict. Talk to his parents and make sure it's not a problem you're there. Make a concrete plan for moving out but ideally live with the parent of your child because that's whats best for your child."

e7jg8l,"NAH. I can sort of see your perspective on this, but I don't think your partner prioritized sitting up front over going with you but rather prioritized giving their child a better experience (which I don't think is unreasonable). If your partner had done this with another adult it would have been different, but considering it was a child I think the priority here was the child. I hope this makes sense, I feel like I did a horrible job of explaining"

e7jpmp,"YTA if you regift this as his Christmas present.  It's tone deaf and thoughtless on several levels.  For Christmas, get him something without any emotional baggage.

It would not be at all wrong or rude if sometime other than Christmas if you told him about the source of the gift and offered to let him use/have it.  That way he can decide if it has baggage as far as he's concerned.  ""Oh, you would like your own Chess board?  I have this one that ex gave me and although it's gorgeous, I don't use it.  You're welcome to have it if you'd like.""  Very different than wrapping it up and putting it under the Christmas tree as a special gift for him."
e7jq34,"NTA, Controversial opinion but deleting the picture doesn't really make you an asshole. It's petty, but lets all get a little bit of a grip.  It's just a digital photo of a random porn star, pretty easy to recover if he REALLY wanted it back, it's not some ultimate betrayal. People on Reddit get so defensive about porn, but it's kind of normal to  have feelings of jealousy about these kind of things, and it's not like you went through his phone to find it without his permission. You just saw it and reacted. It happens. You didn't need to delete it, but it's not that deep.

I think there is a much bigger picture here that is being a bit overlooked. You say your husband has a drinking problem, he is mean and you demonstrated by this story that he doesn't really give much of a shit about how he makes you feel."
e7jr0a,"NAH

It sounds like he's spiraling, and it can be hard to gauge how your behavior is affecting others when that happens. You have a responsibility to your customers and other employees, and his behavior was unprofessional and making people uncomfortable. I hesitate to call him TA because he is grieving the entire life he had before it came (and still is) crashing down. Grief makes people do funny things.

If it feels appropriate for your professional relationship, I might gently encourage him to speak to a therapist. He needs and deserves support, but the workplace is not an appropriate place to seek it."
e7jxay,"NTA. She should apologize for making accusations and for ambushing you. She should have asked if you knew what was wrong with the stereo system. Life is stressful - you don’t take it out on others, you ask for help if you need it. Sounds like she took too much on and is stressed out."
e7jzmo,"ESH -- Him for obvious reasons, you for enabling this and then complaining about it. 

Repeat after me: ""No."" 

If he asks the cashier for cigarettes, ""no. Those go on a separate bill."" Then pay for the groceries and leave his ass standing there. 

If he asks for a meal to go from the waitstaff, 'oh, no, that goes on a separate check, thank you.' He can then say nevermind or pay. Up to him. 

Also, don't pay for his divorce lawyer, just yours."

e7k315,"I mean, NAH, not really.  This is a pretty common relationship problem.

You gotta understand...hearing people complain about work is the most annoying thing ever.  A little venting from time to time should be acceptable, but doing it as often as you're describing has obviously made it cross into problematic territory.

But don't tell her that it died from missing her. You don't want to pile guilt on top of her other mental health issues. Either tell her the truth or that it died because it was old or ill. Maybe ask her caretakers what they think she can handle and go from there.

NTA."
e7kl0j,"Well, you've learned your mother won't follow your instructions when she babysits your daughter. So now you know she will do what she wants, not what you ask her to do.

I wouldn't apologize, and I would make other arrangements for babysitting.

e7kpkg,"NTA she didn’t even want any, sounds like she just wanted to complain."
e7ks5d,"NTA

As it was his fake ID (if it was his actual ID I’d be in the other camp)"
e7ksot,"NTA. You have to live your own life and it's not fair for a grown adult man (or men in this case) to ask you to give up your life and become a full-time maid. You can love your family and care about their health and still not be a nursemaid. And your father is old enough to know that it's HIS responsibility to cut down on the junk food. You are not anyone's keeper, and you're allowed to live your own life. So, yeah, 100% NTA."
e7kw9t,NTA if you truly think she's being abused.  If so then you NEED to report.
e7kwga,"NTA

But you can’t control others, you can only control yourself 

This ‘friend’ isn’t a friend, you need to accept this at some point"
e7kzfg,NTA: This is too raw for you. I am sorry for your loss.  Your family needs help. They are TA.
e7l0g5,"NTA. Your wedding, your call."
e7l0yv,"YTA for not giving her *the chance.* Let her take driving lessons with a professional and see how she does. I'm not saying that you or your husband need to put yourselves in danger, but see how she does with an instructor with instructor brakes."
e7l15d,If your gonna drop out do it now.   But nta if you truly feel you can’t.   Your friend might feel bad though
e7l1cn,"YWBTA. What a shitty spot to put your stepmother and half siblings in. You’re, essentially, asking her to choose between hurting your feelings or hurting your fathers. Invite them all or none of them."
e7l2go,NTA. Don’t want to be accused of being homophobic and racist? Don’t be homophobic and racist.
e7l40w,"ESH, but him *way* more.

You need to not be distracting in a standardized test environment. He was right in that it's unfair to the other test-takers.

He overreacted **so, so much.** Like, absurdly so."
e7l48a,"Your kinda the a-hole...

Finding the right combination of antidepressant Rx takes awhile and the wrong combination can make your life hell.  (Source 20+ years of depression.)

Your anger is misplaced.  Yes, this is frustrating, 
but yelling at your Mom is making this far worse.  

Stop.

Talk to her calmly about seeing her doctor. Be objective, focus on working with her to find a solution."
e7l78o,NTA.   They might qualify for some assistance.  Perhaps guide them in that direction.
e7l9as,NAH - it sounds like you're currently towards the end of your turn. He had his turn while you were burnt out making six figures. He'll have to wait until you're making enough to cover another turn for him unless you can rebudget again or something like that
e7lbbb,"Nta 
Welcome to the real world, Jim,  where you can't maintain gainful employment if you can't be depended on to relieve your coworkers at the time on the schedule or ask for a different schedule.  
That's just an entitled move right there and it isn't okay and honestly I'm not sure why his boss can't do anything about it. I sure don't know who else would be expected to handle it. But if someone shrug their shoulders at me that had the power to change it oh, I would do what you are doing, which is protecting yourself and your ability to provide for your own household. I hate that kind of co-worker. I told my boss once that if he fired the people that couldn't be depended on, he could just give me a raise since I was doing half their job anyway. Bs."
e7lbg2,"NTA for being annoyed, but partially YTA for drawing the line in the sand that his girlfriend isn't invited every time.  That just puts everyone in an awkward place, but especially your friend.  When you make it known that you don't care for the type of person his girlfriend is and that you'd rather hang out with just him, then you're forcing him to choose one or the other and it is a lose-lose for him because it is clear that no matter what he chooses, someone will be upset or hurt by his choice.  


I've been the guy in this type of situation before and it is extremely aggravating and can actually cause a lot of damage to both relationships.  I'd say, his girlfriend sucks for being so greedy with his attention, but you could also work on your tolerance level and include her for the health of your friendship and his relationship.  I feel bad for the poor guy lol.  Too much time with that back and forth is a real shit sandwich for a guy."
e7lf7v,"NTA

That said, let's play this out.  You talk to them about gay rights and try to explain that lesbians aren't evil.  Their dad finds out (and he will) and cuts you off.  He will then proceed to tell the kids you're evil and you will never see them again.  In other words, noble but ultimately pointless.

Alternative.  Play the long game.  Nothing you can do about it right now other than be their absolutely best and most awesome aunt.  Don't talk specifically about lesbians but do make sure they know you believe all people are fine as they are.  Then, when they're a bit older and their dad can't control them, you spring the whole ""hey, want to meet this awesome woman I'm dating?"" and open their minds a bit.

Sorry, I know it sucks and I know it must feel horrible to hear your own family talk like this.  I wish I had a better answer."
e7lfyc,"NAH if you do it gently. ""Calling them out"" will accomplish nothing but dividing you further. Telling them you'd like to see more of them and be included in more family events, or want to start a new annual family tradition will accomplish a lot more in the long run."
e7lj34,"Nta, do it"
e7ljxi,"So wait... he cussed at you first, but you cussing back makes you the bad guy?  GIRL, get out of this relationship and fast.  He clearly doesn’t respect you, and it even seems like he wants to control you by putting you into awkward situations you’ll feel pressured under.  

Edit: NTA"
e7llyf,"NTA- you should feel comfortable in your own hone, regardless!"
e7lnee,"NTA. 

That dude is an asshole. 

I would have been all about having someone help me. 

I’m better now tho, my husband got me a chopsticks buddy! And I’m actually getting the hang of it lol"
e7lni8,"ESH, but him way more. You stubbornly argued your incorrect point instead of just looking it up immediately, but he ***WAY*** the fuck overreacted."
e7lqtj,"ESH while him more, why the hell did you tell your daughter that? Deal with your adult problems with out involving them like that"
e7lsos,"NTA obviously. It’s your day and she’s trying to make it about her. She *is* right about this setting the tone for your marriage in that, if you gave in to her here, she’d expect you to keep giving in to her for the rest of her life.

e7ltup,"I feel like we’re verging into the territory of blaming a child for their parents poor decisions. I get you, if I received that request I would be taken aback but if the child is asked directly what they want and they take that list verbatim then it’s no ones fault. Poor children see the same things children of stable parents do, they are advertised to just as heavily. You sound incredibly bitter and I can kind of get that too, I’m in my 30s and very much want kids but am waiting to be more financially sound and it irritates me to no end when I see peers having their umpteenth child with seemingly no thought to being able to support them financially or emotionally. Poverty and unequal access to education is an exhausting cycle. But it’s not the kids fault for being born to those parents. I don’t think you would be the asshole for not getting the game controller, but if you can swing it financially, why not? I imagine he experiences a lot of disappointment on the regular. You chose to do this to give a child a Christmas, not make a stance against this agency and their practices or irresponsible parents."
e7lu3j,Yes. She will die from that disease and you wouldn't want your grandkids to skip out on seeing you. Go and see her. It will not kill you to do something nice for a sick person to whom you are related.
e7lzn1,"NTA if everything went down as you said.

-you were offered $25 to rake the yard

-your mother helped, without you asking

-she complained the whole time

-but refused to go inside

-then she wants the money that she ""earned?""

yeah no, she sounds awful."
e7m0tk,"NTA but her friends are. You're wife was clearly fine with it, and her friends are inserting themselves into a situation that doesn't concern them."
e7m14u,"she figured out pretty quickly that he would rather receive love in the form of cute plans and food and acted accordingly. she also made it very clear how she would like to be shown love, she didn't say ""i want you to get me gifts occasionally"" she very specifically requested flowers or chocolate once a month. given the explicit nature of her request I don't see how this would be hard for someone who doesn't enjoy giving gifts to do. you don't need to ""find a middle ground"" because you dont both have to receive love in the same form. 

If i was your boyfriend i would have put the pieces together that since you are always giving me cute gifts you would probably enjoy them in return and i DEFINITELY would've put it together after you out right told me you would. for sure NTA. you should look up the 5 love languages, might shed some light on how you both feel."
e7m164,NTA. You can’t afford it and you want to do something more personal for her.
e7m4np,"NAH

I think it's understandable that your new wife feels insecure about this sort of thing, as well as the fact that you no longer associate the song with your ex wife. It really boils down to how much good it does for you to continue singing this song versus how much pain it inflicts on your wife. The fact that you only associate the song with Jodie has no bearing on the situation. Fact is, the song reminds your WIFE of your EX, and you're singing that song to your new child. The connotations here are pretty sticky.

Pick a new song for your new kid. It also serves to keep the first song special for Jodie."
e7m5iw,"YTA and so is your mum. Not for putting him down, if that's what he needed, but for not including your sister in that conversation, or even letting her know that it was what was happening. 


Knowing that he was going to pass away there and being okay with that is very different from saying ""yes, schedule to put him down and don't tell me when""."
e7mdh7,"NTA, but I recommend going. I feel like not seeing someone one last time before their death when you could always bothers people. So I recommend going, but you're not an asshole if you don't want to."
e7mfns,"NTA, she is awful and hurt you in so many ways."
e7mif7,"NTA. Your SO lives with toxic parents (if you can even call them that.) and need a break with them. Btw, link her to r/insaneparents and she'll maybe gain some karma."
e7mlc5,"Definitely NTA. It's not your job to wash other people's dishes, and the fact that you even wash your own while you're there instead of leaving them in the sink like everyone else makes you DEFINITELY not an asshole."
e7mm2q,"YTA of course you did wrong. Not only did you not complete that task, you flat out admitted you had other work to do. No one asked you to put up the decorations. You aren't paid to decorate the office. You are paid to do your job. So do it and don't ask us AITA when you don't do your job because you are."
e7mpes,"YTA - It's Santa Rule #1: when you find out, don't shit on it for everyone else. You absolutely should have made clear to your son to keep his mouth shut."
e7mq0y,"YTA because you didn’t tell him what you wanted and then you got mad at him for not doing what you wanted. He’s not a mind reader. If you want to do something special for your anniversary, talk about it! Plan something ahead of time or be clear the day of about what you want to do. 

He kinda sucks for inviting his friend over on your anniversary but he probably thought you didn’t care about doing much for your anniversary so it wasn’t a big deal. 

Side note: I noticed you mentioning not getting your hopes up about him *finally* proposing... you need to talk to him about this if you haven’t already. If marriage is an expectation of yours, you’re going to need to be clear about that with him. You don’t want to end up sitting around for 8 more years, never getting proposed to if getting married is what you want to do. 

He may not want to get married, he may not think you guys need to get married after being together for so long, maybe he’s waiting to ask you, maybe he’s never thought about it. Who knows what the case is here? But you need to communicate your wishes to him."
e7mtgq,"NTA, also if this happens often please see a doctor."
e7myas,YTA I don’t think you understand the meaning of “unintentionally”. You intentionally both made fun of her beliefs and terrified her.
e7mz4u,"Nta - she is taking advantage of you being willing to accommodate her to begin with. Condo association isn't going to tell you to walk on egg shells during normal living hours. It isn't like you can levitate and it also isn't like you walk like an elephant. You are doing nothing wrong, op."
e7mzh8,NTA- you reap what you sow.
e7n0bh,"1) you guys have TOO MANY DOGS, there is no way that many dogs are getting the proper care. And you have a husky puppy?

e7n2fu,"NTA - I lied about my faith at work for years. When you're an atheist in Texas, it's just what you do. Ironically, it was my first job at a Christian bookstore that finally pushed me into atheism, but that's beside the point. 

Bottom line is, you sound like you're really sort of caught between religions and you're perfectly okay for giving yourself space to figure it out. She's the asshole for acting like it's black or white and putting you choose on the spot. It's none of her damn business."
e7n43h,"NTA he's being incredibly insensitive for not understanding how racist calling a ceremony ""tribal"" sounds."
e7n4gi,"I'm an atheist. In the Army, I wore a headscarf in some Afghan villages out of respect for their culture. If you're just doing it so no one sees your dyed hair, YTA. Probably. Particularly because you have a choice to dye your hair, knowing that you'd probably have to sit those classes out."
e7n6yo,"ESH. The way you said it I think was a jerk move. Sounded accusatory and like there was no trust or faith in the relationship. I think she’s TA for ghosting you though. That sounds really weird. Even if you were right, still ESH."
e7n742,"NTA. You have to eat.  
You are not ordering takeout delivered.  You are bringing leftovers.  Not too sure about coworkers trying to guilt you though."
e7n7ml,"This really isn't an AITA question, is it.

Look into temporarily deferring your student loans. They will still accrue interest but in my experience, they will let you take a short term deferment for just about anything. Maybe that might help the situation."
e7n8px,"If there is an agreement to share these things then y ta. 

You would be better to talk to her about it, maybe she just likes the songs and cant be bothered creating a new one.

Maybe ask her if it can be renamed so its not so obvious what its for.

Although while it is an A move you could always add a few extra songs... I've heard baby shark really sets the mood."
e7n8uh,Then NTA. You should talk to him about how uncomfortable it makes you.

e7ne6m,NTA - some of the rules are ridiculous.

You should have had this conversation with your boyfriend before posting.

He should have okayed the post THEN stood behind you if any shit came from it.

If he is not fully out then anything you post about you two needs to be fully approved by him."
e7ni4s,"I agree with everyone else that you’re NTA. But I will add, and I don’t mean this is a bad way, that if weight gain means you’ve lost your attraction to him, maybe you shouldn’t be together? For a relationship to work long-term you should probably be able to get past a change in appearance. Though of course, this still doesn’t make you TA. If he doesn’t have any motivation to lose weight and you’re at the point where you can’t even enjoy sex with him, it’s probably not worth staying together imo."

This sort of behavior from a parent is always a precursor to the parent trying to take your money.

Prove with a paycheck stub that you are making your money legally.  Otherwise you mom is welcome to piss off."
e7nkf5,"NTA, my sisters used to do the same thing, always plan on going to a restaurant or the movies and always “forgot there wallet”, it’s your money so you can choose not to go."
e7nlxt,"I totally get that. I do think I was unintentionally an asshole and couldn't believe myself. It made me wonder if I had spread myself too thin over too many friends, failed to be a good friend to all of them, and realized it too late in the worst way."
e7nmij,"NTA. You weren't, at the time, dating, which gives him no input into this decision."
e7nno6,NTA. A true friend doesn't steal the spotlight at another friend's event. If she wanted to have a dinner to announce it at that would have been for her to host. Stop chasing her.
e7novc,NTA. I hate group projects for this very reason.
e7npl2,"NTA, jesus. Quit the damn job if what you are saying is even remotely true."
e7nq69,NTA personally when meeting people I met online for the first time I always want a public place. If money is his excuse offer to treat him to coffee maybe. That way he doesn’t need to worry and you can get more of the first date vibe you wanted.
e7nqmp,"NTA, the pill is for both of you, you’re just the only one who has to take it. I’d probably find someone else to sleep with too"
e7nsp8,"NAH. Your question was not out of line, and the reply was not out of line either. I don’t read the reply as a personal attack because it was not about you. The reply was “not everyone has privilege.” That is not the same as singling you out by saying “you, OP, are privileged.” These people may have no idea that you get money from family for Christmas."
e7nt8t,"NTA not to sound horrible but , they need to realise that there are other people living around them and just because their child is autistic doesn’t exclude him from the rules , 6 months is a long time , especially since you pay to live there andyou have to put up with that"
e7nu5i,"NTA

He sounds very entitled. And I suspect that you are right in that if you lend it to him you will never see it again."
e7num5,NTA. A parent should never hold the cost of raising children against their kids.
e7nwsr,"NAH. It's understandable for him to be sad, but you really shouldn't feel bad for having prior paid-for plans that involve other people. YWBTA if you cancelled on your friends that are going with you to the market for inconveniencing them. Your birthday bud will get over it, sometimes schedules just don't align."
e7nz4t,"NAH, I agree that it sucks and seems kind of dumb, it’s the same at my job.  But from the company’s perspective, they are paying you to be there so they want to get their money’s worth."
e7o08m,YTA.  You could not be bothered to spend 10 minutes to help a whole heap of people. You may get good grades and a star pupil. But you are a lousy team member.
e7o0xf,And yet step dad and his ex were perfectly ok with it when it was OP's son getting the shaft; now that the situation's reversed it's suddenly unfair to the step daughter?!
e7o2bv,ESH Sheesh. Both of you should have picked up the cans. Don't be so juvenile.
e7o343,"Honestly, it sounds like his love language is different from yours. I suggest y’all take the quiz together and figure out how to best show the other your love. That being said NAH, you are entitled to your feelings as he his. He wanted to show his love by buying you things and possibly wanted to make sure you like them. Some people don’t pick up on clues and want to be told what to get and do. Maybe in the future, give a list and then he can pick."
e7o38b,Shitpost. What does it have to do with you?
e7o4lw,ESH.  Her for two-timing your cousin.  You for not insisting that she break up with him before you and she got serious.   Your cousin for cheating on her.  Ugh.
e7o5u1,yta. if you are canceling for the 3rd time in a row you dont have the time for dnd and should drop out of the group.

e7o8gm,"NTA - they’re not your partner anymore though, you broke up with them."
e7ob4x,"NTA, OP. And this situation really sucks. I think they completely disrespected your budget, constantly misquoting prices without notifying you when the prices became more expensive. Save your money. Spend Christmas with your friends and dog. Buy yourself something nice and still save 1500+."

e7ol2z,"Was there a reason why your mom is so against your uncle living with your grandma? If there isn't any specific reason, your mom sounds like (sorry) TA here, like a pretty big one."
e7oncl,"NTA, NTA, NTA! It's your property, not his. Christmas lights are even a fairly non-religious part of Christmas! It's not even as though you have a manger out or anything (although that's still perfectly fine!) This is completely absurd.

Edit: everyone saying Y-T-A has some good points, except:

>We both have around 3 acres each

I live on 3 acres, and can confirm that this shouldn't really be an issue. 3 acres is a lot, and even though I'm in the front third of the 3 acres, I never hear car noise at all."
e7opdz,man I don't know this is really gray area all I want to say is that if you're going to play a vengeance paladin then you don't want to piss off the DM because he can pretty much at any point yank your powers.
e7or42,"YTA   I get not wanting your kids to walk in on that, but the kids need to learn boundaries as well.  Restricting adult content in someone else's home is ridiculous.  Even FROZEN is PG. 

 What if you ban adult content and then your kids walk in on them having sex or talking about something not kid friendly? Pretty soon your girls are probably going to have sleepovers with their friends.  This seems like it could be more of a teaching moment.  

You brought your concerns to the in-laws and they offered a decent solution...setting up a don't leave the bedroom rule.  I get kids need to be able to leave for certain situations, bathroom etc. But why were they out and about in the first place?"
e7ose8,"NTA in the least. They sound awful and incredibly inconsiderate. Get some better roommates that don't sacrifice your comfort, sleep, and happiness."
e7ot0j,"Yta. Unless you’re watching a movie with him, this isn’t your business."
e7ot64,"NTA. She's the guest, she needs to adapt if she's inconveniencing you."
e7oxeo,"YTA, but in a typical “angsty teenager” kind of way. 

There is a very obvious reason why they want to limit your screen time & social media at or near bed time. Sleep! You may not realize it, but getting enough sleep as a teenager (well, as a child and an adult as well) is critical to your physical & mental health, and the screen light has been proven to disrupt your sleep for quite a while after you actually shut down. Plus, being attached to social media notifications all night long is not only unnecessary, it’s really unhealthy from a mental health standpoint. 

You don’t have to like their rules or even understand their rules, but “no phone after 9 pm” is certainly not unreasonable. You’re 15- they’re quite certainly paying for your phone/plan, and they 100% have the right (& responsibility) to set limits."
e7oxsh,"It's not your fault that he is a mess. Most likely he is only threatening self harm to manipulate you.

e7p3y1,it's just weird
e7p6ee,"You need a new neurologist, most people with Tourette syndrome do not have vocal tics but uncontrollable neck and body tics like you described. That is probably why the medicine works. Many advancements have been made in the last 5 years and you should be re-evaluated."
e7p6xk,Seriously?! I would have disputed the bill and not left a tip. NTA. Bitching about a tip to a customer is considered rude even here in the US. I would never look at tip before someone leaves.
e7p9qv,"Your parent is giving you, a grown ass adult, the SILENT TREATMENT?

Fuck that. 

You are NTA and your parent will need to work on transitioning from the role of parent who tells you what to do, to being in an adult to adult relationship with you.

If they cant sort that out, they will find themselves very far removed from your life."
e7pavb,"NTA - You have corrected her multiple times, after that it's not forgetfulness it's disrespect. Don't be friends with people who don't respect you."
e7phf1,"NTA, with caveats.  I don’t think relocating is going to solve these problems.  Your husband is not willing to put you and your son first where his mother is involved.   You briefly mention that she provides your childcare. That’s HUGE. Perhaps your husband sees this enormous gift and feels he owes mom a bit more?  

Geography may stop random stop overs, but pressure for money, guilt, requests for help— those will reach you anywhere.  Those won’t stop until your husband makes them stop."
e7pkou,"NTA

Because that's what this is."
e7pp5b,NTA.  Go for it!
e7pwm6,"YTA. You had zero right to get mad at your friend for pursuing the girl you liked after you threw away your chance, and you're certainly an asshole for being with your current girlfriend when you like someone else.

Dude, you literally decided not to tell her you liked her, and you started dating someone else. Neither of your friends have done anything wrong and you're just bitter."

e7pyxa,"NAH

Mind reading and telepathy do not exist. You didn’t tell, he didn’t ask."
e7q2ys,"NTA -- you were the nearest adult. He needs to follow instructions from all relevant adults, not just his ""parents"". You gave a clear and understandable instruction. You were teaching him an important life lesson. I would hardly call that disciplining. 

All your aunt is doing is teaching him that he doesn't have to obey anyone but her and your uncle. That's not going to work if they ever use a babysitter. That's not going to work for when he gets into school. Doling out punishments should be left to the parents for in home discipline issues, but giving corrections should be allowed by the nearest adult."
e7q416,"NAH. I can see why you're upset. You worked hard to get him a nice gift you thought he would appreciate. Nobody wants to see their gift regifted, especially if you thought you got something they would really like. But your boyfriend did something very nice. I'm sure he would much more have preferred to eat it, and I don't think he was trying to disrespect you or your gift. He just saw someone who needed it more than him."

e7qaxi,"NTA. You don't have any obligation, you weren't close, and the paid entry thing is weird af."
e7qcvg,NTA. You tried to handle it in private. She brought the public eye on the argument. She may or may not think oils works. I dunno. But I do know its pretty likely she said it would help with specifically the things her grandma has to get her to buy them. Thats scummy af. Good for you for protecting your grandma

e7qsmr,"I think YTA, but lots of this is about your phrasing. ""She needs to eat less food"" is super judgemental, and if she's at the bottom of a healthy weight range, then she's not really overeating. It does sound like she has a bit of an unhealthy relationship with food, but just telling her to eat less won't fix that. And the getting winded thing is most likely a fitness issue that doesn't have anything to do with how much she's eating."
e7qsul,"NTA. You couldn't have known. You were trying to get paid your worth, and an old gentleman's agreement got in the way. If business relations are severed, that's the companies' problem. Not yours."

e7qtql,"NTA- But I don't think he's mad about the lawnmower, I think he's mad about the principal of it. You don't return an item broken, and I completely understand that he might be mad on that. Or he's projecting his stress on the lawnmower being broken. Just try to reason with him"
e7qv2t,NTA -- you came up with a reasonable alternative.
e7qv77,"NTA, I'd feel very uncomfortable doing anything in a person's home without their consent."

e7r348,"You're not only NTA but you're an example to all of us who work from home. It's way harder to self manage time and distractions than have the surrounding colleagues and bosses keep you on track. 

You've got a way that works for you and you should feel no guilt or shame or anything about that. As you say, if it's urgent, someone will phone. She needs to grow up and realise that the presence of a boss doesn't dictate that you need to concentrate for work."
e7r46o,"NTA - what are you supposed to do, never tell her and just conceal your pregnancy? You told her privately so she had opportunity to take it in and I can see why it’s upsetting for her but in no way does your pregnancy affect her chances of getting pregnant so there’s no reason for her to be upset with you. 

Congratulations!"
e7r4qu,"NTA.

Sounds like you're a fan. You already bought tickets to the show. Sounds like they're ungrateful asshole celebs."

Get that money back that she lent you though, and threaten her with small claims court if you have proof that she promised to pay you back."

e7roe0,"NAH. The man needs a place to stay. You and your children deserve to have access to the public park without feeling uncomfortable. 

This situation sucks. It’s a governmental problem though. There’s not enough aid for the homeless. 

I’m non confrontational so I probably would’ve gone to another park. But I don’t think you’re an ass hole for calling the police. I just hope he was taken to a homeless shelter he could stay at.

Maybe you could take your children to a homeless shelter to give back for the holidays. This way they know to not look down on others, and it also might make you feel less guilty. (Even if you shouldn’t)"
e7ruz7,"NTA, he's a creep.

Hope you reported him to security."
e7rvj3,"YTA with good intentions. If a girl is feeling insecure about something you tell her she’s beautiful and reassure her. Instead, you came up with a plan to “fix” her area of insecurity. 

To a girl, that screams “he sees it too” and makes her even more insecure. And upset. 

It would be different if she suggested it, or if she were unhealthy or seriously overweight. But she’s not. So yeah, you kind of fucked up here.

It’s just a disconnect. She came to you with a “problem” so you wanted to find her a solution. All she wanted was reassurance."
e7rze3,"YTA. I would say YTA but it's cus you don't realise what it looks like... You make it look and sound like like getting gifts for people is a huge inconvenience but you do it anyway for the social norm. 

Just for the record, sending a gift straight to their house and not wrapping it to save ""time and money"" is not very Christmas.. and the most likely consequence is that they might feel like your enthusiasm in their relationship is not reciprocated. Wrapping paper costs like £1/$1!"
e7s01i,"Yta she tried to compromise by having you go to her parents and you straight up said no, then after she made plans you tried to backtrack and got angry at her then accuse her behaviour of being toxic."

Dont send them along in new clothes, send them only in their older clothes so he wont try and keep them, thats something lots of divorced parents do with these type of assholish parents.

He sounds utterly like a child himself"
e7s6oa,"NTA. You are never required to attend an event you are not comfortable with.  Full Stop. There may be a consequence in the form of a lack of acceptance from that peer group but you don't have to go.

e7s9i5,"YTA

LA has plenty of public transportation options. I didn't have a car when I visited and I took the LA Light Rail and the buses everywhere. My partner and I managed to get around without any issues. If your mother is paying for the car and she doesn't want you to drive it, it's her call. If it's in your brother's name, why not just let him drive? If you have other issues with your mom refusing to lend you money when you were in trouble, you should talk to her about it."
e7s9u1,"NTA. She's being horrendously hypocritical.
If she doesn't like it she can stay elsewhere. It might teach her some responsibility!"
e7sdmt,Couples counselling. The car sounds like the least of your issues. NTA
e7sg6m,"YTA - stop getting bothered about something so small. Your reaction was totally disproportionate and uncalled for. 

I suggest an apology and just ignore small things that bother you. 

You’ll never survive in a work place or serious long term relationship with this kind of attitude or response."
e7sg90,"NTA - because I think she should wait until she's 18 to decide this.  I begged to have my nose done as a teenager all the goddamn time, low and behold I'm now an adult who's never even thought about it again until I saw this post."
e7skkd,"NAH - you have a month to reply. You know your mind and that you’re likely to change your mind etc. So you did what works for you.

e7sn9e,"YTA. You sound surprisingly spoiled for a pregnant high school dropout. How do you barely look pregnant at 5 months and a month goes by and you’re already ‘huge’ with mobility issues? You probably also expect her to financially support you when the baby arrives - did you work out how you’ll pay for anything once your bf goes to college?  Think of watching the kids as the price you pay to live in the house. If you don’t feel comfortable bathing the boy (9 years old is too old to be bathed by a teenager IMO) talk with the mother about it and work something out. 

You don’t sound mature enough to be a mother. I also call BS on doing poorly at school because of your hormones. Get your shit together, you’ve only got a few more months before someone else’s life is 100% your responsibility, sounds like you can barely take care of yourself.

Edited: Initially thought ‘9M’ was 9 months, not 9 male. I’m in too many online baby groups."
e7spwk,"Nta.      It’s your money,   She shouldn’t be charging anything to you without asking.      Don’t try to parent your moms money usage,  she is an adult.  But no, she doesn’t get access to your money."

She cheated on you man. Have some pride and never talk to her again.

Harsh but true. 

Going back to an ex is like digging in the trash for a meal.

I love my two daughters so much, but if I could do it all over again, I wouldn't be a mom. It is still a big taboo to admit that having children isn't the most amazing thing in the world, but for a lot of us, the lows far outweigh the highs. I'd never ever tell my kids I feel this way, but I think this is something you should be able to be honest about with you partner in marriage counselling, and the fact she *told your child* this is disgusting.

No offence but if you're always the one who needs to make an active effort to keep in touch and to hang out else you're left in the dark you weren't really friends in the first place, more like conveniently there together. As with any relationship it needs to be a two-way street. Sad truth is that life happens, people who you were once close with can drift apart."
e7t80c,NAH. I could see turning it down it in a 10 year marriage but not with a 2 year girlfriend. Just because she wants to leave town doesn’t mean you are required to.  It would be nice to tell her so she can figure out what she wants to do. You could be broken up in 6 months and regretting a decision that insures your future financial security.
e7tcxy,NTA you should definetly tell him.
e7td46,"Why not? Does everybody have to jump off their machine, interrupt their workout and wait while this guy does his thing?"
e7tgp7,"NAH - but it's not your house. You don't get to choose whether or not a hook belongs on the wall. Clean up if you want, but others don't have to do the same. When you get your own place, you can keep it the way you want it. Also, maybe start looking into what it'll take to get your own place... perhaps put your free time into that."
e7tj4l,"Approach her calmly but sternly and say "" I will not communicate with you until you can speak to me in a respectful, calm way. If you cannot treat me like a respectable adult, which I am, I will not be able to properly communicate with you.""

I had to do this with my mom, I would still call her and attempt to keep a relationship but the second she was disrespectful, condescending, or rude in any way I would repeat that phrase. If she continued with her behavior I would simply hang up. If she was able to correct her behavior we would continue our conversation. It took almost 2 years, but now we have an adult relationship where she knows to respect me and my decisions 

NTA"
e7u34a,"Not an asshole for hating them, but YTA if you don't do them. The way I see it is, someone had to remember to buy, send and address a card, or even just venmo the thing, the least you can do is take a few minutes to send the note.

But!! You don't have to super customize each one (no one is comparing thank yous), and I think it's ok to type and print it - - maybe with a little note that says ""sorry it's typed, my arthritis is acting up!) and then just sign them. Done and done."
e7u4o0,NTA. What they did was incredibly rude and controlling. What time you get up is none of their business.
e7u5o8,"Any chance that you could refund the cost they paid? It sounds like they probably aren’t prepared to perform at all, but it would be shitty to kick them off after they’ve paid. If you can refund them, NTA"
e7u80z,"NTA. My father actually did a very similar thing to me. He and my mother gave me 50% of an investment property (the one I was living in at the time). Years later my parents went through a very messy 4 year long divorce. My father claimed they had never given it to me, despite my name being on the papers. He took me to court. I could have fought it, but I wanted the divorce to be over. He still thinks he never did anything wrong.

It’s not fair and it never will be. But sometimes money turns people into completely different persons. I love my dad but I’ll never forget how he betrayed me. There’s just some trust that can’t be recovered after something like this happens. Push the issue with your dad if you want. Just know that he may have already convinced himself that he doesn’t actually owe you anything."
e7uipq,"NAH but I’d consider what he’s saying. Most people hide their bags simply because the bag contains fecal
 matter and when out, especially at places to eat, it’s considerate to keep it hidden under clothing."
e7ujrz,"YTA but gently, I understand your fears of them doing those things but if you’re going to choose to be friends with people and date people who partake in those things then you can’t freak out while they’re doing it. Especially if they’re doing acid, you freaking out could really damage their trip and put them in a bad place"
e7ukmg,"NTA, your boss has no backbone. Making a sweeping policy change and alienating an experienced employee over one dumb customer complaint is stupid. You owe your boss nothing."

But anyways NTA"
e7uxgp,"YTA. Peeing on the seat is gross. Not refilling the water, and leaving dirty pot(s) or dishes is inconsiderate and irritating. And it sounds like you make a habit of this sort of behaviour so I understand why she would get upset. 

She sounds perfectly reasonable, and adult to me. You sound jealous, childish and inconsiderate. This honestly sounds like a shitpost."
e7uzlp,"NAH. 

You should do what you know will keep you healthy. You know your body best.

Be considerate of her feelings though. You should explain to her that it’s not because you don’t like it, it’s strictly because of you counting calories and sticking to a meal plan."
e7v4hn,"NTA. Also, just get some damn poopourri for that bathroom. It really does make a difference.

Goddamn, you can really tell which nurses were and weren’t CNAs by how much they bitch about poop."

e7vjox,"I dont think you're ta but she probably isnt doing it intentionally. I look at lights, moving object, whatever flashes in my line of vision. If someone is texting and I can see it without trying to look I'm just gonna look. I do try not to but if I'm not actively thinking ""dont look"" then I'm going to end up looking. Lol I'm really adhd though so idk if she is or maybe she is just nosey. Its understandable to feel uncomfortable just consider that not everyone brain works the same as yours does and it probably doesn't occur to her right away what shes doing. I mean youre both 14, self awareness isnt really something either have you have fine tuned. NAH imo"
e7vqau,"NTA.  I don’t think the religion part is an issue, or saying god loves you. But telling your friends personal stuff? That’s a breach."
e7vtuh,"YTA (but only a little bit). The ""nontraditional"" isn't really the problem. It's the construction with the implied ""but"" that's the problem. You basically said that you enjoyed it *despite* being nontraditional. Seems like you meant (and should have said) that you enjoyed it *because* it was nontraditional. Something like ""thanks for the great meal. It was so nice to have something nontraditional instead of boring old turkey"" would have been an actual compliment. Yours ended up sounding very backhanded even though that wasn't your intention."

The other option is to be factual. “She watched my child and kept him safe.”   There a lot to be said for what isn’t said."
e7w74h,"NTA. You can ask her not to copy it, and I don't think that would make you an asshole -

BUT honestly I would just ignore it, let her get her ripoff tattoo (ugh, unoriginal tat designs are *the worst*), and have your bomb artist nail the art, and get your tattoo anyway. In the end, what is asking her not to get it really going to do besides cause friction? She'll have (what I assume is another) meaningless tattoo she impulsively decided on, and you'll still have a thought out piece with significant meaning behind it. To me, it's not worth the trouble. *Everything* is inspired by something, just let this go."

e7wio5,"nah, its understandable for you to be hurt by this but keep in mind shes in a whole other country that she might never get the chance to explore again, let her enjoy her time abroad"
e7wjtl,"NAH, but I think you need therapy. You talk a lot about how you *know* what your father feels, what you can see in his eyes. But you don't really know unless you ask him. This could very well be more in your head than in his. You remember a conversation, but who knows how serious he was about that and if he changed his mind now that he is in this situation? These thoughts you describe sound pretty on point for someone with depression, actually, and meds don't fix all of that."
e7wkpo,"NTA. You were standing up for your sister, and that's a very good thing of you to do. When I was learning/fluent in French, I would use random French words in everyday conversation.

Hopefully she can respect your boundaries, as petty as they may seem"

This isn't all that different then if you had lunch next door and ordered it. And as long as you didn't demand full bakery access when the online store only had limited menu. It shouldn't be a problem.

e7wpy2,NTA people drift apart and if you don’t feel comfortable reaching out that’s ok. If she feels like she wants your support she can ask
e7wqfq,"YTA but not for the reason you think. 

It sounds like she's in a psychologically abusive relationship. The reason many people don't leave is because they feel they don't have support from their friends and family. The right thing to do would have been to support her - she clearly KNOWS people don't like him... Why did you pile on?

If you're good friends, you just cut one of her ties outside of an abusive relationship. If you're acquaintances, you should have minded your own business.

Ultimately all you did was upset her and kick her while she's down: she knows everyone hates him."

e7wyy4,"YWBTA if you lied about being gay. Its a sexuality, not something to use to make someone angry. Also you might come across as immature and affirm their opinion about you if you say it too spiteful and shiz. I can understand though, the petty revenge side of it.

e7x6jc,"YTA. The intention was good but they're right. You *really* should have discussed this with them. It'd be one thing if we're talking about a guitar or something, but drums are fucking *loud*. This gift is going to affect everyone in the house and also potentially the neighbours. On top of that a drumset takes up a pretty significant amount of space. It's fine to want to spoil your niece, but a drumset is one of those things that you really need to run by the parents."

e7yr9e,"ESH

She was 17 when she moved in, so you forced your lifestyle on a teenager and expected that to go well. No nonveg food, even in her own room doesn't give any room for living her own life, so she probably already hated you for it. Obviously what she did was over the line but it sounds like you both had problems with each other and it wasn't going to fix itself.

She's an adult now and it's your house, but I think it's illegal to kick someone out with no notice if they've lived there for two years. There were probably half measures to take that would be less extreme.

You disrespected her nonveg lifestyle way before she disrespected yours.

Edit: everyone calling her an evil stepmother, can you imagine having a teenage girl who disagrees with your ethical choices living in your house for two years? We only read about this one snapshot of events but there was probably escalation on *both* sides leading up to this.

Edit: if one more person comments that paying rent is required to make you a tenant, I swear. It depends on where they live, but all 50 states have tenants rights and you don't have to pay rent for that, you just have to call it home. You can't just kick people out like a fucking rom-com."

You have been together for two years. You're closer to 30 than 20. It is past time to start thinking about what you life looks like in the future, and that includes whether or not you want this girl to be there. Stop 'what if'ing yourself and MAKE PLANS.

Do NOT offer your friend $10k.  She may take that as an admission that she is right and she you for the remainder.  Instead, tell her you won the money, but you understand her upset.

1) your relationship was different then. Partners tend to support each other through sudden hardships. That isn’t the situation now.

It's, and I mean this with sincere respect, a selfish way to look at gift giving. 

I'm a strict minimalist like your husband. My family has come to a pretty nice compromise: any present they gift me comes with the receipt. If I decide I'd rather have the store credit, then I can take it to the store and get it.

It should also state what will happen if either party wants to end the contract early.) I’ve only done freelancing for a few thousand at a time at most, so hardly amounts I’m likely to sue over (especially friends and family), but just the act of openly discussing expectations and how each person will handle themselves REALLY helps avoid conflict down the line. If the other person won’t engage in that talk, run."

(Don't managers get paid more than laborers? hmm...)

This isn't an advice sub, but I would suggest that you two sit down together once or twice and list out all the things that have to get done in general. Maybe you can find a nice even way to split it up, so one of you is in charge of *everything* related to laundry, or bathroom, or kitchen, or cleaning, maybe sharing some key tasks like keeping rooms picked up or laundry or shopping, or dividing by days instead of tasks, however the division works best for you two. It's possible bf has never even thought about things in this way, so you're giving him a crash course on everything that needs to be done, once, so he can learn once and for all, ask questions then, and have no excuses later. 

That way, gf and bf agree once on everything they each need to do, and from that point on, gf can expect bf to handle *all* of his part. After like two weeks you can check in again, see if everything was done, if something needs to be redistributed or clarified, and then do that going forward.

Send her an email and see if she'll let you take it.""

I tried to tell him that wouldn't work because the syllabus stated that nothing will be made up without an excused absence. I emailed her anyways and she opened it back up for me saying I'd only get half credit (so basically 5 instead of 10 pts for a 100).

Your mom might be softer on him because she feels so bad for him - he will never lead a 'typical' life, and will miss out on a lot of things.  He may not show it, but he is struggling with life.  He may be jealous of you, if he has that level of awareness, and this might be what your mom sees - that you're lucky to lead a typical life and your brother has to watch  you  do it.  However, your mom should do more to protect you.  You should not have to put up with his bad behavior. She might think that you can handle it though.  If my son came to me and told me he was upset with his brothers behavior, I would take that very seriously.  Try to talk to her, and see what happens.  Wish you the best..."

From a moral/philosophical standpoint I absolutely agree. But weddings are difficult to plan at the best of times, and I would not hold it against you for wanting to respect the money and effort thus far.

So how about this: include some context in the wedding. Take a moment to acknowledge what occurred on that land, perhaps make a donation to an organization that works with less privileged black kids and encourage your guests to do the same. Consult with local black community leaders about respectful ways to give back, if what you're feeling is that you're taking away."

Look, let's not kid around here: listening to people have sex is entirely different from listening to a loud conversation. It's a window into what is otherwise a private and intimate event.

They have been super inconsiderate of you, which is why they are also TA here, but just because you are content to put in earbuds (seriously, I don't know how people can sleep with those in) doesn't mean everyone is. You need to communicate, which you have so far refused to do. 

Incidentally, stop writing off the discomfort around hearing sex (or you hearing them) as people being old-fashioned, because that is rude and disingenuous. I'm a very sex-positive person, but I respect that not everyone has the same level of comfort that I do, and I would not have the gall to assume that my way was the only way that wasn't ""sad""."
e8g5o5,"ESH, but mostly you.  you're taking them on her weekend and making her pick them up because you have more important things to do then drive your kids home. The question isn't should you pay. The question is, is it really the hill you want to die on when your ex is allowing you to have them on her weekend. Pay her the $5 and thank her for sacrificing time with the so they could be there. Be the bigger person. You know what? I bet she would even love a 5x7 or 8x10 of them all dressed up in their wedding best. Be a father first and a petty ex never. If she wants to be petty, let her.

You can say my house, my rules and be justified. But the drug testing, the over one month groundings, and the isolation from his social group seems too much. But from personal experience, all my friends that had parents like you ended up on some really heavy shit. Couple aren't with us anymore. 

You know, it's not a hard leap of faith for a kid to move on to drugs that get out of his system much faster. The real dangerous ones.

What is wrong with people wanting to spend time with you and celebrate who you are?? 

It’s not that you were an asshole to the people that did this for you, but maybe you were an asshole to yourself. You shouldn’t be looking at your birthday like that. You could have had a really good time and it’s not often that a bunch of people will want to come together and do something that you like like that. 

Maybe take this time to re-think that your birthday is not as much a marker for how you’ve been progressing but more of a celebration of your life. 

You kind of sabotaged a wonderful opportunity for fun and being with loved ones for somewhat self-hating and self-critical reasons. 

In a sense, it’s kind of really selfish and just negative."

e8l8aj,ESH.  She sucks for wanting to cheat and you suck for saying you would help her.
e8l9h6,"YWTA. It's freaking 8 years of hard work, he would surely like to see his loved ones around.   
You sound super grumpy with the idea of going from the kick-start, however maybe it's worthy to be TA because otherwise, you might be an EPIC TA going AND being pouty the whole time."
e8ldzk,"NTA You have some issues to work out with babies, but I don't think that bringing a one month old to a concert is a great idea."
e8lg0u,NTA: he proved it when he called you a POS after borrowing a charger for two weeks.
e8lj5g,"Have you considered the reactions of your older children? 

I get the nanny works for you, but perhaps your older children are tired or just tired of not going home after school and they just want to be at home or something. Have you asked? Have you talked to them?"
e8lkbh,"YTA because you aren't twelve. If you are old enough to be married, you are old enough to realize that birthdays are not a big deal. You can celebrate your birthday when he gets back.  He can't go ice fishing with his family every weekend. Get together with a friend or your family on your birthday and have your husband treat you to something special when he gets back. Also, the passive aggressive way you approached the issue sounds exhausting."
e8lmaw,"NTA. Her punishment has gone over the edge into abuse/neglect territory. I think you probably could have phrased your feedback more constructively, but this is a 9-year-old. I get that he should face consequences, but there is such a thing as disproportionate punishment."
e8lpzq,"You’re not the asshole and He’s overreacting. If he really expects you to be honest with him, he’s going to have to stop throwing tantrums every time."
e8lqdq,"NTA


Your friend won't get expelled for being sent a picture. Especially since he likely didn't get a super high score, and left the chat immediately. He'll probably be talked to though. 


You should say something, and get the ball rolling for an investigation. Cheaters ruin everything."
e8lqhz,INFO what are you hoping to accomplish by telling her? You just want to point it out to her? Unnecessary and will make her upset. You want her to change her laugh? YTA
e8ls6x,NTA just because you buy your parents a gift with your siblings does not mean you have to suddenly buy for your partners parents.
e8lsfz,"NTA anyone who knows that a cactus has spikes should know not to get pricked, and if some accident happens doesn't immediately panic.  I doubt she was upset afterwards and you shouldn't feel bad for her either. She didn't accept any help that you were trying to give and thereby you shouldn't continue trying."
e8lt88,YWBTA - write a letter and burn it instead
e8lwpa,"NTA. Your mom has been an asshole to you your entire life so she shouldn't be shocked you wouldn't go to Christmas, and she makes no attempts to rekindle your relationship either. The facebook may be slightly petty, but it is still understandable on a human level."
e8lx0k,"YTA for proposing before ""knowing if you want to fully commit""."
e8lxac,"NTA because what else are you supposed to do if the postal service never delivers to your actual house? Maybe talk to the neighbor about what they would prefer you to do, but I don't see any alternative, nor do I see a need for an alternative as taking two minutes to just walk up and down his property every couple of days(?) Isn't harming anyone or anything"
e8m45b,"NTA, just let your thank your first friend and let them know that you found a ride that fits better with your schedule"
e8m6sx,NTA. It was an honest mistake and your boyfriend’s daughter didn’t seem offended by it. Your sister is making an assumption here. It wouldn’t hurt to put the date on your calendar to remember to wish her a happy birthday next year.
e8m8kh,"NAH I can relate with your husband wanting to believe in a place that he is comfortable with, but I also agree with you. It seems like the workplace is taking advantage of him so if anyone is the asshole its the workplace."

e8mili,NTA - Don't do it man. Never loan money to family and friends . . . UNLESS you never want to see them again.
e8misg,"YTA. Yes, it's annoying when someone is on their phone with the light glowing when you're trying to sleep, but address that separately. Once you threw clothes over his phone you were deliberately hiding it from him. That's very different from not offering to help him search for it when you don't know where it is. Whether losing his phone warranted a freak out or not, you were trying to be TA at that point."
e8mmcw,"I've actually visited her a few times since the stunt she pulled off. Everytime I visit she was still the same and I just filter out or change topic whenever she have smtg negative to say about my parents . I just realised I somehow haven't seen her in a while for no particular reason other than I'm lazy/lazy to be patient in hearing the same things over and over again. Oh, and I also know for sure she will give me a hard time for not visiting for so long when I do visit her.. + we don't really have anything to talk about anymore"
e8mmip,"Nah

If she has been sick with the shingles for 2 weeks, I will assume that she is out of the loop and has not been at work and probably doesn't have a solid hold on exactly what went down if you did not provide it to her as her friend. The first thing I would have done is call my friend oh, I guess that maybe what I'm implying here and I do think it may be true.
I don't know y'all's Dynamic but I will say that if you did not do that when you got canned, maybe she perhaps thought that you did not want to talk about it or that it wasn't as big of a deal as it appeared initially?
 When we have friends for a lifetime, a lot gets Shrugged away. It just has to because we are dealing with human beings. If we don't communicate, it really isn't fair to judge how they reacted. I think the best thing to do is to be honest and sincere and gentle and to have an adult conversation about it, if this is a friendship that you want to have continued. Maybe it isn't. Maybe this is just one piece of many that are basically resentments that have built silently. If so straighten your shoulders and walk away classily. You can still be kind when you run into her. But you don't have to necessarily make that person a big part of your life. At the end of the day, your friend has been sick and they did not have the say when it came to whether or not you kept this job. So I don't think that I really see any assholes here, because I think that I also understand why you would be stung and hurt. But I don't think that your reason reflects that you have a friendship with someone who is just a butthole."
e8mrnw,"ESH - If your friend is “seeking company elsewhere” and not willing to confront the issues she has with her partner, that sucks. Was it the best idea to maybe share information that your friend told you in private, also no; but at the end of the day they were both wasting each other’s time. Not a great situation all around!"
e8mt5u,"NTA. I'd honestly talk to your boss about her, tell them that she tends to monopolize your time. She sounds incredibly lazy"
e8mtmg,ESH. He does sound like a jerk but this is a passive aggressive way of handling the situation that doesn't actually improve your relationship with him or the roommate situation. Also aren't you and the other roommates also uncomfortable in the inferno? Maybe less than him but still 79? 85? Yuck
e8mtvy,NTA. No one wants to waste money at Christmas. Be kind though. He sounds sweet.
e8mykn,"NTA. I'm a teacher and am surprised by the judgments here. I'm all for a laid-back approach and joking around with my students but I would never under any circumstances refer to them in that manner. Our job aside from teaching the material is provide a classroom where students feel respected and safe. Even thought this was said in jest, taking a dig like that is disrespectful. Your daughter probably did't think too much about it, but for someone who is supposed to be a role model and mentor to call them 'Dummy' is not cool. I think emailing to get his side would be a justifiable thing to do."
e8mzwl,[removed]
e8n0ot,"NTA. Your gf is being totally unreasonable. A sore throat is not an excuse to call in sick. If she needs the dress tomorrow then she will have to suck it up and get it herself, facing the consequences while doing so."
e8n8d0,"YTA.

I don't know why women from a different generation seem so obsessed with erect nipples or visible nipples under the shirt, going braless, etc. but nipples, visible or not, does not harm anyone and does not command attention.

Your son's gf's body is NOT yours to dictate and no, you cannot tell someone to dress a certain way. She might not like your fashion choices either but she's not telling you to dress like her either. Lay off."
e8ndqn,Nta. You don't want to be part of the family business
e8nflg,"NAH. It's hard for teachers sometimes when the reaction of parents can be variable. Reactionary parents can make a teacher's life hell. 

Having said that,  you deserve to be respected and recognised as her partner. 

There certainly isn't the stigma attached to homosexuality,  lesbianism,  transsexuals etc that there used to be,  so you could be surprised,  especially if you live in a very liberal area.

Does she have a close colleague that she could out herself to safely to test the waters? Sooner or later,  you're both going to have to get on the same page on this if your relationship is going to survive."
e8nihc,"NTA-But your group of friends should consider breaking ties with this emotionally abusive and manipulative ""friend ""."
e8nny4,"NTA. In general I do think it's good to be respectful, and telling your mom to shut up is not good. But in this case it sounds like you just snapped after a long, loud argument that was not at all your fault. Your mom obviously has some issues. I know it's hard, but try not to take it to heart. It was really nice of you to bring her a soda."
e8nqi8,"NTA. It was on the low end for a tip, but the bartender's behavior is inexcusable. 

Also, it's not like it was a huge bill. At MOST she stood to gain, what, two more dollars in your tip? Bad word of mouth from you, or a bad review online, will hurt her a lot more than losing those two bucks."
e8nt9b,">. My boyfriend replied ""Your approach wasn't much better,""

Your boyfriend thinks he was flirting with you and somehow you owed it to this dude to feign interest? Your boyfriend, of all people? You're NTA (your boyfriend, frankly, is). You don't owe it to any dude to let him down nicely, I think men underestimate how often this sort of shit happens and how much energy goes into carefully letting someone down nicely or wasting time listening to them, ect."
e8nve9,NTA. Your girlfriend doesn't need to be with you every second of the day. You need your space sometimes. Talk to her and make her understand
e8o2ul,"NAH. 

It seems your both struggling with your own feelings and issues about the situation and how to communicate it a way that doesn’t hurt either of you. 

Difficult situation all around."
e8o5hi,"NTA Ben is not ta for cancelling (though v annoying) - and you are not ta for not refunding him. There are consequences for being a flake - and if money is committed then you have no right for it back. Reason is that everyone else may have made different decisions if the original cost was going to be higher.

Mark is very slightly ta for guilting you and enabling Ben."

e8pf6b,NTA let it go and let him go. It's emotional abuse and he sounds toxic
e8pfre,NTA. But you may as well break up. If he’s adamant about being with a vegan and you are not a vegan I don’t see how this relationship will work. Cut your losses and move on.
e8phfc,YTA for not reporting them to the police already
e8pi7u,"ESH. It's part of having roommates, people will have different ideas of what's the 'right way' to do something.

They're silly for making it such a big issue, but you're silly for not just spending 2 seconds wiping it down to avoid this disagreement once they made it obvious that it was an issue for them."

Unless he was kidnapped in his youth and kept in a basement and had hip-hop blasted at him or some other hip-hop triggered PTSD event, that reaction was totally uncalled for."
e8psdt,[deleted]
e8pvj2,"YTA. You don’t need a bandaid fix, you need to address your insecurity/workaholism/whatever your issues are. You should work to live, not live to work. Your employer couldn’t care less about you, you are thoroughly expendable to them, so why jeopardise your life and personal relationships for them. 17 days or 10 days is not a huge amount of time to take off work. Annual leave is there to be used. 4 months is more than enough notice to give to take 2 frigging weeks off. It’s insane that you would consider cancelling and losing hundreds of $ simply because you’re worried about taking the annual leave you’re entitled to. What’s changed between now and when you agreed on the trip and booked it? The only situation in which this would be at all rational is if somehow you genuinely thought you would lose your job if you went on this trip, and even then you’d be better advised to rather find a new employer, rather than work for one that treats you like crap. 

The reason I say you need to sort yourself and your priorities out now is that this flaky b.s. is unfair to your girlfriend. Is she supposed to stay with someone who refuses to have a reasonable work/life balance and take leave to go on vacation, someone makes plans and then abruptly cancels on them at significant expense? You’re showing what you value by your actions and that you don’t value her.

EDIT: also, you booked the Maldives trip 3 months ago and still haven’t requested leave for it or told your work about it. That’s 100% on you. Sounds like you’d always wanted to back out of it. Which is flaky and stupid. If you didn’t want to go you should have just told her so and not agreed to book."
e8pwcy,">**I don't really care to be quiet** because its the kitchen and in my opinion, if your sleeping right next to the kitchen, then you should be expecting to hear kitchen noises. Am I the asshole for having a **good daily schedule**?

YTA for this.

Humans have different activity schedules, that's normal and expected. Everybody should be able to make the most of their productive time, and if yours is during the morning hours, that's fair. However, that you call yours a ""good daily schedule"" sounds like you're looking down on others for not waking up as early as you.

Also, you should at least make an effort to be quiet when you know that being loud will disrupt other's sleep. Of course certain sounds are unavoidable, but right now it sounds like you're not trying to limit your noise levels at all.

You would not be the asshole if you continue to use the kitchen but try to be more silent and speak to your cousins to evaluate whether you're waking them up."
e8pwg7,"NTA. Why would you want to spend any day around people who deliberately make you feel bad, let alone your birthday."
e8pzid,"Haha, holy shit, NTA. What an idiot.

He loves his dog in a different way than he loves you. There's a lot of different kinds of love out there. Loving a dog is simpler and much less difficult than loving a romantic partner. The emotions involved are more clear, less complex, and more consistent. There's no emotional risk in loving a dog, a dog and owner are never going to have arguments or disagreements, and your dog won't ever hurt you. Stands to reason he could love his dog 'more.'

But what kind of douchebag would say that to your face? In front of other people? Does he just straight-up not care that he hurt and embarrassed you for literally no reason? He compared you to a dog... and you lost. Wtf."
e8pzqy,NTA - Reasonable request honestly though your SO sounds lazy and it might be worth thinking about that he doesn't value your job either as he expects you to do all the house work while working. I don't get why people think working from home is different to working in an office you can't take 20 minutes off your office job to go home and wash your floors

e8qdlt,"ESH. It isn't fair for her to unload her burdens on you all of the time. We all have complaints about something. A partner is a good person to talk to if you want someone to listen, but ALL the time is just too much. 

I'm having a hard time believing you couldn't think of a more gentle way to say what you said.

>I snapped ... In the nicest way -that I know how- I looked her dead in the eyes and I told her I don't want to hear her complaining about her job if she's not doing anything to change it

No one snaps in the nicest way they know how. I can't think of an instance where you snap at someone you love and NOT owe them an apology afterwards.

But instead of telling her, tell him to change his plan completely and let her pick her own dog.

He can surprise her with new dog gear and a trip to a shelter, where she can choose her own pet.   It’s still a surprise, but a much better one.  He doesn’t want to get a dog (mill or shelter) that was totally affectionate because it adores him ... get home and discover it couldn’t care less about her.   She’s got to be there, so she can find the dog that reacts well to her.

If he still doesn’t seem to understand, *then* tell the aunt."

e8rp46,"NTA

>That I should accept that his family gets visitation too whether I agree with them or not.

You're punishing more people than your parents and this whole stonewalling  ""I won't do it because someone told me to"" is childish as all hell.

Grow up, and shower if someone tells you that you need a shower. It's called being an adult.

Insecure about BO and you think refusing to shower is going to make you less insecure? That's absolutely insane.

My brother did this crap too and it's nothing but disgusting and as you get older the only person is punishes is YOU, because more and more people think  less and less of you because you don't even care enough to wash yourself."
e8s8i5,"Slight NTA 

Look, I’m under the impression she’s the one for you otherwise you wouldn’t buy a house and let her not pay any bills. 

Listen fella, and maybe this might not be popular but you’re looking at it from a guy’s perspective, have you considered that maybe she is doing all this for you? Decorating the house so that when you come back you have a nice place to look at? 

Don’t take the road to send her back to her mum’s house, you’re bitching out of a potential for you to grow as an individual and help your SO. If after support that you provide she doesn’t fix her ways, then you need to cut your losses and take the high road. 

You mention she cooks and cleans more than you, usually, when a guy says that, it means 99/1 she’s doing the cleaning and the other 1% of time you’re doing the cooking cleaning. What are the items she’s buying? Cleaning utensils? Make up? Clothes? Are they things that you use in the house? 

Are you offering her financial support? Maybe she feels that she’s already burdened you with paying rent, so she doesn’t want to hassle you further 

This is a life partner, if she is, you need to address it, talk 

You’re NTA for how you feel and the situation around it but part of being an adult my guy is that you’re able to communicate in a calm and composed manner before this tipping point and for letting it get to that point, you’re TA, but the NTA aspect overweighs that."
e8s8qn,"YTA both of them spent alot of time together doing something special and you ruined it. You don’t have be comfortable with have a ton yet but  with all that work you should have let her keep it for the day because there was literally no harm in it, she is at an age where she will be wanting to wear it more and more. Saying no all the time because you don’t understand it is just a shit reason btw your the parent so learn or find a way for her to learn you think is appropriate, as in it doesn’t have cursing etc. She doesn’t need a ton yet but light make up should be given because; she’s interested in it, if encouraged and reinforced to do it for herself not others, there is no harm in it and she’s growing up. You need to get over that."
e8s9eu,"NAH... This is way above Reddit. You are placed in a very difficult situation and you made a choice for the betterment of your family. Honestly, chances are there are some pros and cons to both decisions. No one can call you an asshole for being stuck between a rock and a hard place."

As HR, I can't address Phil without evidence that justifies my choice. Moving Cass was the easiest method to minimize conflict that's why that was done.

Please talk to HR without the evidence, and tell HR that there are multiple instances of harrassment with evidence but the victims don't want to announce. When a similar instance occurred, we interviewed everyone universally regardless of whether they were harrassed directly or were a witness. You are a witness."
e8sf6o,"NTA. Since you didn't raise your voice or make a face it sounds like you didn't do anything wrong. From personal experience working in an office, I think a more appropriate response would be ""I cannot look right now but I'll find you when I'm done here."" Then you're free to go look when you want to (even if it is just to avoid conflict with the friend)."
e8siec,"NAH You two need an open dialogue. I don’t think she’s the asshole for being afraid of insects, you’re not the asshole for not wanting to kill them.

These two things just don't mesh.  You both need to decide which one is more important to you, but it doesn't seem like you could both have ""your way"" and keep the relationship.

Regarding splitting costs for food in a group, my friends and I have a system; in the restaurant, we order our own food, and only one person makes the payment for everyone at the cashier. Once we leave the restaurant, the paying person passes the receipt to the rest of the group, since receipts usually have the cost breakdown of all the food. Everyone looks for the cost of their own items, then hands the money to the paying person.

* nut-free: why?!  you didn't mention that anyone had allergies, so you're just stiffing the variety out of personal preference it seems?  am i missing something?
* gluten-free: you really shouldn't be pushing this on other people.  it's your choice, let people make their favorite cookies.  the fact that you say ""gluten free is optional"" still puts pressure on people to be gluten free. if it's optional just dont' say it"

Yes, it probably would have been better to word things differently, but it's mentally exhausting to deal with these situations. A bad relationship doesn't just affect the people in a bad relationship, it affects everyone around them who care about them.

That being said, the more you tell someone clinging to a bad relationship that they need to get out, the more they'll distance themselves from you. I was once in a bad relationship and there were people who I knew did not like the fact that I was in that relationship, and you know what? I didn't talk to them about it because I knew how they felt about the other person. I'd usually find other things to talk about with them. But if they too aggressively started questioning me about my relationship, I distanced myself from them, kind of cut them out. I know, I was the asshole for doing that, but I tried to always leave a path for that not to happen. In the end, I had to realize that they were right on my own terms. Maybe that's not a good thing, but it was what it was.

You're probably not going to convince her to break up, but she's got to realize that the person who she's talking to doesn't like the person she's with. Either she can handle that or she can't, but she can't expect you to feel the same way about everything if she's the one calling you up to pour everything out on you like that. If she knows your position, she doesn't have to agree with you, but she does have to respect the fact that you've already stated your position and it is different from hers. You don't want bees, don't poke the nest."

I’m not vegetarian but my ex husband suffered from gout so I modified our meal plan so that we had a lot of meat free meals each week. It’s not hard at all to make tasty vegetarian dishes or at least make better side dishes than just bread and salad.

If he’s paying the majority of the grocery bill and working full time and so you’re cooking because that’s your division of labor, then just try?

There are a lot of very tasty dishes you can make. Lots of stir fry (breath of the wok is a great recipe book!) lots of Buddhist recipes, many sides that include beans or other legumes. 

If you guys want to cook separately and that works for you, fine. But it does seem kind of assholey to not even try to accommodate half the time.  He can cook for himself, get some boca burgers or something for protein. But wow.

Kind of makes me feel like a closet veggie because I only eat meat I can source and confirm and am happy eating veggie...but I Iove meat!"

You know what the “generational thing” is?

30-40 years ago, people stayed with companies for the long haul and were rewarded for doing so. They had pensions and benefits and bonuses. 

Nowadays people are lucky to have a living wage. You can’t miss time for sickness, actually taking vacation days you’ve accrued is considered “lazy,” and you’re expected to be reachable 24/7. 

FUCK THEM. They will replace you in a heartbeat, so who the fuck you being loyal for?

I just killed myself for the last year in a hospital i worked as a RN. I worked weeks where i was there for 7 12 hour shifts in a row because they were short. HOWEVER, i moved from per diem (worked whenever i wanted) to full time in July. In September, i was injured on the job. Comp denied me, and i was told that because i didn’t qualify for FMLA (i had the time, but was 300 hours short of the requirement in a rolling calendar year) they were firing me. I tried to get a spot back on light duty status and was told no. I had to come back without restrictions. I tried to go from full time to per diem again to keep my spot. I was told no. 

Everything i did for them, and they spit in my face. To make matters worse? No unemployment until i sit under a hearing. They’ve fought me on it, saying they weren’t aware that i could work with restrictions and so my leaving was voluntary. 

These are the types of companies we work for these days.

Pick a date, invite a couple friends (ideally at least one he knows and likes) and invite people for a few drinks or something.  I'll also add that part of him blowing you off could be the new lady in his life and you being recently divorced...optics over reality is common for such matters to many partners"
e976lk,"YTA:   Eric obviously does not ""work well with others"".

And you have failed to train, supervise, discipline, and/or terminate Eric as needed.   Consequently, he was insubordinate and assumed your role by trying to train, supervise, and discipline another employee.

Eventually, you find out he's driven out another valuable employee AFTER THE FACT and without any idea why.   ( Eric intentionally cut you out of the loop is why. )   THIS IS A LEGAL RISK.   If you get sued by her, your ""I had no idea what was going on"" is a losing strategy in court.

You're not managing him properly, so he's playing you.   And I'm sure he has an explanation that you'll give him the benefit of the doubt, because you don't see that he's acting in bad-faith.

Him being insufficiently polite and deferential to YOUR WIFE is a whole other problem.   That's a personal insult to YOU, bro.

Here's what you do.   Hire another pharmacist immediately.   Don't waste time other than, ""they're properly licensed and not drunk at the interview"".  Then upgrade and fire Eric."

You're an adult and you get to choose how you want to spend your time. And while growing up there will be a time that things shift from visiting your own parents to celebrate the holidays at your own place.

When I was early twenties I would always stay at my parents' place. Then my bf and I would spend the first day of christmas at his parents' place and the second at my parents' (switching every year). When we had kids, we invited our parents at our place (those were great times). Now, our parents are too old to travel and we've gone back to visiting them during christmas.

But you did what you could, what your boss said was essentially a no, you can't leave. Unfortunately your job doesn't have to care about your wife or your pets, though that does say a lot about the company.

If money is tight you need to do everything you can to keep your job to keep going in the future. Unfortunately we may lose our pets at unexpected times, this was a time you didn't have a lot of choice over.

Instead of being upset at each other you should both support each other. That's why you are together."
e97h9s,"NTA but I would keep giving the gifts. Knowing your biological father at least had you in his thoughts periodically is better than he didn’t care enough to ever concern himself to keep any connection.

e97l8h,"NAH. She shouldn't get upset with you if you do go. She can be frustrated, sure, but she shouldn't take it out on you. Don't waste the tickets. Definitely let her know ahead of time so she isn't surprised, but I would say to post on your social if anyone else is free to join you. Alternatively, if there's a way you could take the day off yourself and help your GF with her job so she can finish early and you can both go, that would make you the hero and make her happy, but that is a big ask and may not be possible for you.

I actually had a similar situation for a play my wife really wanted to see. It was a Broadway production of Cinderella. Very well done. It was in the city where I work and at 8 months pregnant with our first, she was going to take the train in after work. But unfortunately there was an issue with the train line and they were cancelled. And since it was rush hour and she was already tired, she just went home. Since the train wasn't working and I was already downtown with the tickets, I grabbed the last colleague in the office and went to the show with him. Fantastic show, and she was upset, but not with me, there was nothing I could do and wasting the tickets would have been silly"
e97lj1,YTA - it’s one thing to use a professional you don’t know. It’s a massively different thing to use a professional who is a friend. Boudoir shoots are extremely intimate and revealing. By having him do the shoot you allowed your male friend to see that intimacy. I can understand why your husband would be weirded out or upset.

so much asshole. she's making the shared space more uncomfortable.

the next compromise i would suggest is that you unplug it whenever you want to be in the living room.  it can be plugged in in the general case, but unplugged when it would make you uncomfortable.  that's much less time unplugged, and puts the burden on yourself, rather than her.  this isn't a fair setup, but it keeps the peace better than an ultimatum or legal avenues."

e9b6mz,"YTA: Your mom wants to spend time with you because she loves you and probably misses the fact that you were once a small child and are maybe approaching an age where you're going to move out of her home forever.  Trust me, as someone who once had a mom that ""smothers"" I can tell you that you will appreciate the fact that she is trying to build a relationship with you now once you're older. One one day you won't be down the hall from your mom anymore and she won't just be able to pop into your room to see what you're up to. Try to be kind and grateful that you have someone who loves you."
e9b7nx,"Ehh.  Kinda YTA.

You left the house in the middle of the night, to pick up an ex because she called you crying.  Stopped at the store for her, drove her home, and decided to text your gf about it the next day.

The GF you left sleeping at home through all of this.  And nonchalantly mentioned it to the next day.

Of course she's going to feel some kinda way about you just sneaking out to pick up an ex off the curb.

>She said she doesn't think I cheated, but that I 'couldnt resist a pretty girl calling me for help', like what? Its extremely weird she would say that considering I know she talks about how she doesn't find fat people attractive, and Erica is easily 250+ lbs

It's not a matter of if your GF thinks Erica is pretty.  She's saying that *you* can't resist a girl *you* think is pretty calling you for help.  I'd imagine she's pretty secure in thinking you find Erica attractive, since you did date her."

It's their vacation too and it's kind of unfair to force them to spend it in an uncomfortable arrangement just so you guys can pay a little less. 

You're being petty by focusing on how the singles ""get a whole room to themselves,"" when we all know that the couples want to room together anyway so it's not any skin off your back.

Kid has no idea what time is worth yet. I had a neighbor kid dropping, limbing, chopping, and cording for pennies. I agreed to his price, but paid him almost double when it was done and told him to know his worth. Next time I needed him, he priced accordingly and thanked me."
e9d2y1,"NAH

I would leave it to my SO to decide if they wanted their mother invited or not. If they don't care... not happening. 

I also have very little patience for someone who endangers the life of my kid... I'm weird like that. So the one caveat is I would want to make sure she is never in a position to do that again... but it doesn't sound like she is."
e9d4av,NTA. Your girlfriend is nuts.

e9dc50,"Thank you for the full story.

NTA

Please if possible stop your father from getting another animal for the wellbeing of that dog. Perhaps writing out a budget on the costs of the dog and how many lottery tickets he could buy will help him visualize the financial side."
e9dd39,"NTA - Your mom is an adult and can do what she pleases. Bad relationships are like heroin addictions in that you can't make a person stop if the don't want to.

But you and your sister are also adults. You don't have to be exposed to situations you don't want to be exposed to."
e9dg3e,"I am 100% on the ""pets are for life"" boat as well, but in this situation I think that if you do your due diligence and find this dog an appropriate home you WNBTA. I feel like no matter how much you love this dog, his quality of life will suffer as he'll inevitably wind up separated from you and then family more and more due to fears of his behavior while you're pregnant or around the baby. There are absolutely good and bad situations for every dog, and not all dogs are compatible with children. As you could not have reasonably anticipated that you would be having children, this isn't a lack foresight on your part, it's just a sad circumstance where you need to make a tough decision in the best interests of your family AND your dog.

I wish you the best of luck finding him an amazing home!"
e9diem,"YWBTA here. 

Finances are a top contributor to divorce cases. This is something you __must__ tackle head-on either between you two or potentially with a therapist. 

Splitting finances may be a real come-to-Jesus moment, and it may be effective, but it’s worth a serious discussion first. Going behind your spouse’s back will cause more worse problems."
e9djno,"NAH.

Honestly I think your parents should have never gotten the cat in the first place. Yours or not they were the adults and should have known they would have to accept some responsibility(such as vet expenses). And then to throw them outside unfixed? That was seriously irresponsible."
e9dv6i,NTA.  It's really annoying when people complain over and over about something that they have control over.  But how about having some fruit salad on the side that could be eaten with or without the cheesecake?  Some of your other guests might appreciate a healthy alternative for dessert and then she won't have a reason to blame you if her stomach hurts later.
e9dvjj,"Esh, but only because of how you responded. ""I'll pass"" is not how you turn down an invitation to be in a wedding. ""Thank you for thinking of me, sadly I just can't afford it right now,"" is the polite response."

e9e5wn,"NTA, that's stupid. It's a gift card, that's what it's there for."
e9e6hq,"NTA/NAH

I'm hard pressed to call your ex TA. She had trauma with her dad and it might have an impact on her relationships for the rest of her life. It wasn't fair of her to impose those insecurities on you but I am sympathetic to her feelings. 

Your drinking sounds reasonable. When you're a college kid, it's sort of expected that you go a little crazy and to not be 100% responsible with your alcohol intake. That being said, when it comes to having a relationship with a victim of abuse, you probably should have been a little more sensitive to her concerns. They weren't coming from a place of concern for your wellbeing as much as they were coming from a place of fear for her own safety."
e9e6z0,"NTA. You’re making your work space into just that, your space. If others come in, they have to accept the decor that comes with it."
e9eahl,"NAH Yes you aren't suppose to expect gifts but relationships are a two way street so there should be some give and take and it seems this issue is highlighting the lack of give and take for you. 

You should either decide you don't care and keep doing what you do or just stop giving a nice of gifts and then you won't feel slighted."
e9edkf,"NTA for everything except the dietary stuff.  It doesn't sound like they're great pet owners, but messing with an animal's diet out of nowhere is just asking for diarrhea.  Vets recommend a mixture of wet and dry food because the wet gives the cat a little extra hydration, but it's far from mandatory.  My cats eat exclusively dry food (for dental reasons) and they're fine.  Don't mess with the food.  But I'd say no, you don't have to hit the cat.  Just keep your bathroom door shut and it becomes a non issue - if they ask, you won't even have to lie."
e9ektj,"tough one to judge.  but i can't justify your lies and going against court here.  you should fight this through legal means, not with theft and lies.

YTA.  give the cat back, and pursue future checks on her treatment of the pets to see if she's changed.

\---

Also, i'm curious, if this was the woman's daughter, and she had convinced CPS to give the daughter back, would you advocate theft and lies there, or is this different?"
e9eo2q,YTA... you had a bad day and upset her ok. So she doesn’t come to you for help. You reach out when she’s having a hard time and she doesn’t want your help so instead of backing off you make her feel worse by piling on? Asshole.
e9eo50,"YTA.  It's a restaurant, not a library.  If you've ordered everything you plan to order and are dawdling over your coffee so you have an excuse to hang around, the least you can do is let the waitstaff make the table as ready to go as they can for when you finally do decide to leave.  And even if you disagree with that take on the situation, I'm genuinely not sure how you feel it would have been *less* rude of her to just reach across you than to tell you what she was trying to do."
e9erm0,"YTA, not for wanting the vasectomy but for 1. how you approached it with your wife and 2. how little research you seem to have done on the topic. 

My husband had a vasectomy during his first marriage and recently had it reversed. The reversal surgery can be really expensive, painful, and there still isnt a guaranteed success rate. But it seemed like our best option. IVF can be invasive to women and really mess with hormones. And again, very expensive. As much as I want a baby with my husband, I'm hesitant about IVF. 

Also a heads up - if you ever go down the road of divorce, you could still end up in a nasty battle over frozen sperm and embryos, just as you would custody of children. 

I respect your decision to be the one to step up in terms of pregnancy prevention, but a vasectomy isn't a decision to made alone or without extensive research."
e9erq6,Grabbing other people’s private areas is generally rude in public. If you’re in a bar or club that’s different. But no one else wants to see your foreplay. YTA mildly

Omg she's not ""just a friend"" after he slept with her the day after breaking up with you. 

If his reaction was different I would say nah, but making you feel crazy is gaslighting. It's not ""I know it must hurt but she's a good friend of mine, could we find a way to make it work?"", no, it's straight up ""you are being unreasonable"".

Do you really want to be with this guy?"
e9fw8i,"NTA. Talk to your dad about this asap; he may want to pursue full custody of you if he knows the extent of things, and you may need to call DFCS  if there is no food in the house for you and your siblings."

You had the oppertunity to just thank them and leave it lay. Instead you decided to whine about your gift. When he asked for it back you refused. What the fuck do you want exactly? People need to learn to be more gracious about receiving gifts."
e9g3pp,"NTA. You’re 18, an adult, and like you said you weren’t asking permission. It’s not on your mum to set terms and conditions for how you hang out with your friends.

And did a misread that, or does your mum expect you to pay for 2 extra tickets for her and your sister?? Wtf? Your mum is TA for trying to guilt trip you.

Best advice, ignore your mum and set a day aside for you and your sister to spend together. Go to lunch, or shopping, the movies, or do something festive like build a gingerbread house or see if there are activities in your community. I’m sure that will be much more comfortable for both of you, and she will appreciate spending one-on-one time with you. Hell, she might even take it as a chance to open up to you herself about what’s going on in her life."
e9g48u,"NTA, though keep the Altima for yourself and give away the car you've been using."
e9g4yv,"NTA.  No way would I offer a full refund.  Best refund would subtract gas money, depreciation and time wasted.  If you drove 100 miles, that's $50 in gas & depreciation right there, assuming your time is worthless.

e9g6al,Nta. Take over the kitchen and become king.
e9g6ha,"NAH, but I don't think you should blame the kids because of the issues the adults have. They let the slime dry out, but they are kids and not being raised by responsible parents. But my guess is that they probably love spending time with you. Why not take the kids (alone) out for some Christmas celebration? Maybe just for a movie or Ice Cream. Let them know that you care. Your time will probably be the best Christmas present you can give."

It's ok to build your own life. Your mother will adjust.

Good luck!"
e9gjgb,NTA. Who dates their niece’s ex and expects her to be okay with it?
e9gp9j,"NAH.

I totally get why she did what she did if the family is comfortable. I honestly regret putting my ex FWB on our son's birth certificate because he automatically gets child support garnished and he makes my life difficult out of spite. I can see why she decided not to go down that path. I'd not have done it if I had my time over. The small amount of support I get (he hides income/assets) isn't worth having to be in contact wth him and try to get his permission for things. 

You don't want to be a father, and she is clearly happy with you not being one, prefers it even, and the child is well taken care of, so I think you are well within your rights to leave it be. You got lucky not getting saddled with 18 years of child support, so be more careful with protection next time, most men don't get that lucky."
e9gscq,"NTA, that’s definitely way too close of a relationship. The alarm bells are ringing everywhere. I’d give an ultimatum I think. Either distance himself from her or you guys break up"

e9h1u0,"You aren't being bitter or petty. As a nurse who has had the pleasure(?) of taking care of a lot of folks during their last days, death makes people weird. Please expect and prepare for this behavior by your family members to get worse as this process reaches it's eventual end because it most certainly will. Take care of yourself, because the people surrounding your father will not. This is their last chance to rugsweep his behavior, they are going to try their hardest to make this ""okay."" 

NTA"
e9h36m,"NAH. You can’t change what your work needs you to do, especially considering it’s a new position for you. I understand why your wife is upset, her feelings are valid because it’s really upsetting to go back to work after being on maternity leave like that. I think you’ve done all you can do, and I also think she will warm up to the trip you have to take. It’s still several weeks away, give her some time and realize that a lot of things are at play here. Lots of hormones freaking out postpartum, lack of sleep, etc."
e9h4ym,"NTA. I like your plan a lot. If all the kids are ok with it, then let them stay together. The 5yo is too young to care about getting her own room. She will care in a few years when she hits her teen years, but that's a conversation for when SHE starts to feel the need for own space.

From the 5yo's perspective, I can see why she wants to stay in the room with her sisters. She probably already occasionally feels left out of the relationship because her only two sisters are twins, as opposed to all the three of them being triplets. Staying in a room with them is way more fun as a 5yo, and is a way for her to stay connected to them and feel less like an outsider in the sibling relationship.

Moving her upstairs to the attic might hurt at this age more than it would help because EVERYONE else is on the ground floor. She is too young to understand 'the need' for her own room. From her perspective, moving her out now will feel like getting kicked prematurely out of a slumber party everyone else (including the parents) is in on and make her feel isolated (even if though this is not the intention)

Edited for grammar"
e9h9sc,NTA but you guys seem to really need to sit down and have a talk. This blow up and post makes it super clear that you feel like you’re doing more than your fair share of the work — and from what you’ve written you are. I’d say you should try to have a candid conversation with him about the division of chores and the toll it is taking on you. Give him the chance to step up and help.

Spare this poor woman from the pain."
e9hmg1,"YTA. I get not liking to play with your brother but he doesn't have anyone else. You're lucky you enjoy having online friends, but he doesn't have that luxury. He's acting out against you and calling you a jerk because he's an 11 year old kid who probably looks up to you and doesn't know how to express his feelings properly yet.

Just not wrong enough to be TA if that makes sense."
e9ilq1,"YTA, but very gently. I absolutely get where you're coming from, but at the same time it would cost you little to do this for her. Someday her poor planning and relying on others will catch up to her, but today you can choose to be kind...for your sake, not hers."

Guarding “your lane” and trying to stop people from merging does nothing but add to the traffic problem. At best you stay one car further ahead in the line of traffic and at worst you cause a collision.

As an artist she's probably trying to go with a very specific look for her sculpture and needs a very specific reference to look at. 

YOU called off a date with someone who looked heavier in person than in her photos. Which, mind you, photos can make a person look thinner than you are irl. Lighting, patterns, time of the day/month could make her look bigger or smaller in photos hell even the damn angle could have. 

It's not a double standard. You straight up called off a date with someone who could have been very excited to meet you and talk because she was heavier than you thought. 

SHE passed on a model that didn't match what she needed for a sculpture. Those aren't even on the same coin. She's not getting her sculptures hopes up only to crush them in it's face. 

Ya feel me."

e9lsqc,"You're not really a true AH (just more naïve by the sounds of it) but for this sub and this situation, yeah YTA.

**Her parents asked you to respect their boundaries and you proceeded to actively disrespect them.** Which definitely makes you look not that good in your girlfriend's parents' eyes. For many reasons. You probably (read: very likely) also made the maid feel uncomfortable. Also honestly, wtf, why would you not respect your girlfriend's parents? 

It's her job, let her do it. She likely has a system for how she does things and you more than likely disrupted that.

Just because you think you're helping, doesn't mean you actually are.

You wouldn't get up in a plane and start helping the air hosts? Or hotel maids? Or anyone in the service industry?

This is how I felt when working in the restaurant industry; Lots of customers would try to ""help"" in different ways, such as taking drinks off my tray and passing them around. However I would balance the tray in a certain way, adjusting it to how I took items off. Suddenly taking the drinks off would cause an imbalance, and most likely result in spilling the rest of the drinks over someone, or at the very least me having to suddenly get rid of what was in my other hand to prevent the tray from tipping. Then I have a new mess to clean up.

You are causing an imbalance at her work. AH move, even with your ""good"" intentions 

Another scenario; if her parents invite you over to a catered dinner, would you try ""help"" the caterers? (I hope your response is ""of course not"")

Also why did you girlfriend have to leave with you?

But it would help you if you tried to get used to it, as well as help your relationship with her parents (which obviously would help your relationship with your girlfriend).

ETA Also this is all coming from someone who gets it. My family is very frugal, and everyone needs to pull their weight. However, my parents started earning much more and being home less in my early teenage years. Household help was the best solution, that way they didn't have to stress about basic cleaning etc. When they were home they could focus on just enjoying family time, instead of stressing about chores. Reduced stress for not only my parents, but their children as well. Having household help allowed us to spend valuable time with each other. They were always really friendly with the people they employed, even going as far as to help with their medical costs, social security etc. It took me a while to get used to it, but honestly it just comes down to accepting that all people have different jobs, and respecting that.

Edit #2: clarifications

Edit #3: your actions more than likely sent the message to your girlfriend's parents that you don't agree with them having household help. Even further disrespecting them.
Get used to the fact that all people have different jobs. Respect your girlfriend's family, and their employees. (If I wasn't clear, yeah I'd be insulted, or at the very least feel humiliated, if I was the maid you tried to help. Please learn some social etiquette as well). Yeah that wasn't your intention, but it's all about how things are received.

Some of the best advice Ivve ever received: focus on your message and the recipient, not the phrase you want to deliver (obviously not directly translatable to English, but I tried)"

However I really hope you consider counseling- it is entirely possible for you to have a marriage completely unlike your parents’. 

Both my husband and I grew up in broken homes, him worse so than I, however both ended up in divorce, lots of conflict and fights, the whole 9 yards.

We had the attitude of “I refuse to ever be like them”. When times got rough for us we both sought counseling- independently and together- and worked on it. 

We have a beautiful marriage and I can’t imagine my life without him. I am expecting our first child and it’s a magical time for us... and we are absolutely nothing like our parents.

There is no reason they need it. if their hearts are truly wanting to give your child money for college without strings or legal implications then they can put it in the account you set up. 

Like you pointed out in your post, them having a separate account can screw up your child's financial options if they don't like what your child is majoring in, what school they want to go to or simply decide they're mad at your child. It gives them too much power for people who like control."

The exception is if the boss is leaving: chipping in for a token gift then is acceptable - but not expected.

One of the hardest things to deal with as a young adult is understanding that people are growing and changing at different rates. You will likely grow apart from people as you get older, particularly high school friends. I know that it's probably even harder as an autistic person to make new friends, but you should consider finding new ones. Changes in life and changes in friends happen. Particularly at your age. This is an opportunity to learn and grow, and it sucks because it hurts like a mofo. But those people are not being the friends you need for where you are in your life.

e9rza1,"NTA, you are behaving like a responsible parent. Going no-contact is fine when dealing with friends and nagging parents, but dude is a father. It's not, in any way, acceptable. Missing his custody day with only ""might not be able to make it"" communicated before-hand is not acceptable. Whining about being removed as the emergency contact when he deliberately tries to be difficult to reach is *not acceptable*.

Reaching out to his parents was the absolutely correct course of action to take."
e9s0v1,"You would NOT be the asshole for submitting a DNA kit to prove it to yourself because you’re free to do whatever you want as far as that goes, but you would be the asshole if you pursue it further after the family has said they’re not interested.

e9s1f4,"NAH. It was your wife’s idea. However, having a new baby in the home can be a shock so I would say be prepared for the possibility that the baby comes and circumstances change that prevent you from going. That’s all. It’s easy to plan for it but you don’t know what will happen."

The ""i'm not your therapist"" is something you say to someone who is ALWAYS using you as a therapist, not someone on a first date who is trying to just sort of share where he's at.

e9sspn,"I don’t fundamentally disagree with your wife (or you).  So I’m going with NAH with a couple of caveats.

1) you guys need to be proactive and go speak with the teacher for heaven’s sake!

2) encouraging the kids to tell the teacher “we were just too busy” is not a great move. These kids are going to have to learn how to get the busy work done at some point because you may get away with blowing off a 1st grade teacher but if they haven’t clued in on this soon, grades WILL drop. And not because your kid isn’t bright but because he isn’t going the required work.

I think a lot of home work is dumb. At that age, I think kids should only have “homework” if they need more time to compete something they were given time to do in class.  I have seen some project rubrics that just made me want to pull my hair out when the kids were little. 

But you can’t just encourage a kid to disregard their teacher. 

And some of the activities may be things they share in class or exchange papers to check and now your kid hasn’t done it. Might not be awesome for your kid."

Feel free to tell all your mutual friends about how he was a huge jerk.

He needs to be open to finishing by himself, or you could give him a hand job, maybe even get a pocket pussy to use once you've tapped out. It sounds like your boyfriend wants you to make him cum without helping out at all. Every partner I've been with that regularly lasted that long was super gracious when I tapped out, or made an effort to get close before intercourse so the work wasn't all up to me.

I don't think you're an asshole for not donating anything (that's definitely an acceptable response). But you are TA for dismissing your niece's experiences just because they don't line up with your beliefs. If God is real, then he gave me bad eyesight, so am I disrespecting him by correcting it with laser eye surgery? No, that's clearly a societally acceptable response. If God made your niece a boy, and she's correcting that by transitioning, why is that any worse than my surgery?
I'm not saying you have to change your whole belief system, but definitely consider that train of thought and be supportive of your niece - this is going to be an awful time for her, and she'll be getting a ridiculous amount of judgement and hate for this decision. You can either be a negative force in her life, or be supportive."

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***

I started working at this company a little less than a year ago. Since day one my manager has just not liked me. Not really sure why, but she is constantly just looking for things to hangover me. Luckily for me I do my work to a high standard so she rarely has anything to try hang me with. She also treats most people on our team the same way and we’re all aware of her inability to be fair and professional with people reporting directly to her so try adjust our behavior accordingly.

However, there is one girl on our team (let’s call her Lucy) who our manager likes. I have always gotten on well with this girl and would have called her a friend. She would always sympathize with me with regards the unfair treatment I and the rest of the team receive. A few days ago my manager assigned me a task to do. During lunch I mentioned to Lucy that I was assigned this task but I wasn’t sure if I’d get to it that day. Lucy says she has time and offers to take it on for the afternoon. I’m delighted but know I’ll have to clear it with my manager first.

When we return from lunch Lucy asks if I’ve told our manager about her completing the task. I told her I have not yet but I would. When our manager gets back to her desk she’s on the phone and is then busy in meetings. When she is free Lucy tells her that I have gotten her to do the task instead and she needs guidance. Safe to say my manager was not happy that I had delegated this task and read me the rioting act. When she left I turned to Lucy and probably in an annoyed and frustrated tone said “why did you throw me under the bus like that? You knew I hadn’t cleared it with her to give you the task to complete? And you know how she overreacts and looks for shit to give out to me for”. Now all of this I could have gotten over, my manager is a certified asshole so can’t blame Lucy for the reaction and we all make mistakes and say things we shouldn’t to the wrong people. However, after I expressed my frustrations with how she handled the situation she got super defensive and said she thought I had asked (even though there is no way she could have thought that) and now is completely ignoring me.

So Reddit AITA for expressing my annoyance at my coworker for throwing me under the bus to my unhinged manager?

e9wdct,"NTA, tell him your sister needs to pick up her slack"
e9we1w,ESH big time. You blocked his texts? How does that solve anything. You could have told him that you didn’t want it in the living room in a better way.

e9wzwm,"NTA This is a textbook case of gaslighting and manipulative emotional dependency. 

Gaslighting- you, in your own story, are questioning your very intent when you didn’t tell her about this moment. She immediately frames your intent as sinister and thus, when you don’t remember it that way, are feeling you are losing your bearings on reality. 

Emotional dependency- by constantly texting you, you are unable to communicate with anyone else and are allowing yourself to be cut off from social contact from anyone else. 

This is abuse. Get out of this relationship now."

And also, I believe you have an opportunity here. If she’s normally quite chill and you enjoy living all four of you together, give her a pass. 

ONE PASS does not give people free reign to be assholes. But it might open the floor to a dialogue that she would be grateful to have. Not because she’s a woman or anything, it’s just that I’ve been that person before. I’ve been an ass when I shouldn’t have been and it had nothing to do with that person. You don’t owe her anything, but you could level up as a human by taking a step back and giving her the opportunity to apologize and explain herself. 

God I love when people give me one pass. It allows me to make shit right with people I care about. I hope you get passes occasionally too :)

e9y726,YTA. If she wants to have this baby then she should have this baby. Pro-choice means she gets to chose. You don’t get to tell her she’s somehow less of a woman for making a choice she wants to make when feminism is literally about women making the choices they want to make. You owe your friend an apology.
e9yc9a,NTA. Sounds like they’re being jerks on a power trip.
e9yca9,"As someone who often plans company lunches/dinners, there is so much to consider. 

It has to be Gluten Free, peanut free, dairy free, vegetarian, vegan, etc. 

So when I call venues, I have to specify everything I need considered and I have a short menu to choose from. 

Maybe there wasn’t any other options. 

I mean, I feel ya. I’ve been stuck with many a salad with my gluten allergy....if they remember to leave off the croutons. But I’ve learnt to be happy that they thought of it at all. There have also been many parties I didn’t have a single thing to eat, that’s why I try so hard now. 

NAH. I understand you’re upset and I think you should be, but that could be just what they could do.

At least they had one option available."
e9yfhp,NTA. You both looked over the laptops and agreed to the trade when you met. He should have opened all basic things he was planning to use and verified they worked. It seems that he did as he agreed to the trade. If it stopped working later it sucks but he agreed to the trade and that’s a gamble he took by not buying something brand new. It seems you weren’t trying to scam him or anything so I say you’re in the clear and not the asshole is this situation.
e9yg9e,"What in the actual fuck. No, you're clearly NTA. My abusive ex used to say shit like this to me all the time. *You're my girlfriend, I should be able to be myself with you.* 

Well his self was an asshole. Complete sweetheart to strangers. Treated me like shit. Fuck that noise. 

And just because he's doubly stupid, FAS causes wide set eyes."
e9yhgy,NTA.  They can get off their lazy leeching asses and fix their shit.
e9yjhh,"NTA. Depression fucking sucks, yeah, but it's not an excuse to forget about your responsibilities. Having suffered from depression for several years, I can understand not wanting to go to a sports event because it's loud, there's a ton of people, etc., but it's not like he really has to *do* anything - he just needs to show up, do the whole manly man respectful nod every once in a while, maybe have a hot dog or a burger or some chips or something."
e9yjuq,"For the purposes of this sub, NTA, but I get the sense that she's just being a little motherly to you, and maybe doesn't realize that you're independent enough to - yknow - pay most of her salary. A little reminder won't hurt, but don't be too hardass about it."
e9ym7s,"NTA, just be cool if she says no"

e9yodq,"Originally I was going to say E SH, because:

> my mom was busy working, travelling, making money for us

but also

> she never corrected him whenever he would give her attitude but whenever i gave the slightest bit of attitude, she’d snap and i learned because of that

Sounds a lot like my own (also Asian) mother, actually.

But the more I thought about it the more I'm kind of leaning towards NTA. On one hand I'm sure she loves you, even if it's that whole strict Asian mother way. But on the other hand, providing money for one's family isn't really an act of love, it's kind of an act of obligation. Strict parenting, even in the best of intentions, can lead to offspring resentment later down the line. I get the sense that she's trying to reenter your life *because* she was absent for so long, but she doesn't realize that she doesn't have the positive memories you're supposed to associate with parents."
e9yokp,NTA. That was annoying of her.
e9yq02,"NTA.

It’s a public school, even blessings are inappropriate and unconstitutional and they know it, that’s why they backpedaled so hard.

e9yqln,NTA people who drive like him cause more accidents. Rights of way exist for a reason and its not being a nice driver.
e9ywo8,"Slight YTA, it seems like you're gonna try to force him by holding on to an old mistake over his head. I would instead ask it as a Christmas/ holiday gift."
e9yx7g,"ESH. Your parents shouldn’t expect you to help your sister with her homework all the time, but you should really change your mindset about her learning style. 

Just because *you* think something is easy doesn’t mean *she* thinks it’s easy. As someone who learns through asking a lot of questions and hearing things taught in different ways, I relate to her struggle, and I would feel terrible if somebody said some of the things you said about her about me. 

It shouldn’t be your job to teach her, but you also shouldn’t be putting her down simply for learning differently than you do."
e9yxj3,"YTA You are the pinnacle of fitness in that house. Your sister probably feels very insecure about how she doesn’t measure up to you in that regard. She comes to workout with you, makes one mistake, and you laugh your ass off at her. 

And you say you like to help and teach people? Well you probably just destroyed any chance of her ever working out with you unless you try to see it from her point of view and apologize."
e9yy27,"NTA, life is too short for non family assholes.  It’s too short for family assholes too but that’s more complicated, this isn’t, cut them out but just tell them why.  Will be awkward but less skewed than dodging them in the hall."
e9yzhp,"YWBTA. It would be a lovely gift, if your husband wanted it. Springing something he’s uncomfortable having at the office on him isn’t okay."
e9yzq7,NTA. You have to do what’s best for you. Those kids will be thrilled to have you as their teacher next year.
e9z2w6,"NTA.  All it takes is for one person to sue.  Like a swimming pool, a sledding hill could probably be considered an “attractive nuisance”.  I’m sure if you called your homeowners insurance, they would assure you that you are doing the right thing."
e9z3ai,"NTA. i can't believe every comment on here is YTA, holy sh\*t! you are totally in the right for not wanting to be friends with a homophobe. you are not playing ""thought police"" as one other commenter put it, you just dont want to be friends with someone who holds bigoted views."
e9z5pk,"NTA, she’s a grown up and should understand that you have an out of town guest. And who cares who your guest is, she can wait, and you can show up with a nice housewarming gift in a few days."
e9z5w8,"Me and my mother live with my grandma who has custody over me (my moms still angry over that) and I’m 14, she doesn’t take any meds and doesn’t go to therapy. If I could move out I definitely would but I usually settle for staying in my room, I used to go out with friends but since my friends in my town don’t like me and all of my other friends + my bf live in the next town over I’m kinda stuck at home"
e9z6nu,"NTA. If your sister doesn't want to acknowledge her son is gay, that's her (regrettable) choice. Being warm and supportive is rarely an asshole move. Plus, bringing the BF to a family gathering means the cat's out of the bag."
e9z6yk,"NTA. The other fellow decided to flout two pretty big rules. I probably wouldn't have reported him, but doing so doesn't make you an asshole. He decided to cheat, and his basic lack of consideration (leaking headphones) got him caught."
e9z6zn,NTA You're an adult and can download what you want. But sadly you can't make then pay your bill so....be sneakier?
e9z86c,NTA. Red flags. Run

However as a practical point, I suggest getting into the habit of checking before you preheat the oven, since you now know he has no common sense."
e9zgg3,"NTA, people who try to “fix” mental illness with religion are just downright disrespectful. Do what needs to be done for you, that’s all you can do"

e9ztf1,"NAH. You had no intention of being rude, you were just sticking to the norm. But you definitely need to get them gifts next year"
e9zucf,"YTA. Of course, GF is going to pick the psycho over you.  And you are playing right into the man's hands - he had been trying to undermine her relationships with her friends. She is with an older man who manipulates and belittles her at every turn. She needs her girlfriends more than ever."
e9zw6h,"NTA - As you said, you're not 100% sure yet either. You don't owe it to your company to be completely upfront about your future plans. They certainly won't tell you when they start considering layoffs."

e9zy8h,"NTA. She invited you. I’d go :)

I think you are overthinking this a lot. Just go and have a good time."
ea01gu,"YTA. 

no more than 10 nights a month, so if it was 10 that would be almost 33% of the time. He’s YOUR SO not everyone else’s and sure it’s comfortable to bring him around every now and then which they should accept but having him over too frequently would be annoying. A home is generally for privacy and just because you’re comfortable with him doesn’t mean other people should automatically accepted to be as well. Common areas especially. It’s always awkward no matter who it is when there’s a “stranger” in your kitchen/lounge and it’s not like they’re going to watch TV while you guys are sitting on the couch. 

I would compromise. You sometimes go to his and he sometimes comes to yours. It’s not “appeasing” your roommates. It’s courtesy. You are not the only one in the house and you need to be mindful of the people you’re sharing with."
ea01sy,"She’s right, she won’t have the full college experience. But it is unreasonable of her to expect you to pay for it. NTA. She can get a job and pay for campus accommodation herself if she wants."
ea020k,"NTA- you aren’t obliged to work on your relationship with your brother, especially given his historical treatment of you and your family. Anyone who tells you you’re being ‘overdramatic’ can get fucked"

ea06z8,[deleted]
ea0b2d,"NTA. at the end of the day, it’s your moms house and if she wants to stop smoking she should ask him to cut back. that’s really fucked about your sister and cat, they shouldn’t have to suffer because of him. dude sounds like a dick"
ea0ctf,"YTA

""Mike calls himself bisexual"". This sentence is what makes you an asshole. It implies that you either think Mike isn't being truthful about his sexuality or that his sexuality is something he's willingly chosen. 

For someone who tries to claim that their deeply personal beliefs don't make them think worse of others, that statement suggests a lot of judgment on your part."
ea0g5e,[deleted]
ea0h21,"NTA

You don’t have to take the test if you don’t feel like it. Outside of finding out something you don’t want to know nothing bad can happen. (Not minimizing that, just saying nothing nefarious can happen.) The test either told him this guy is his brother or it didn’t."
ea0ha0,"NTA it’s really rude to leave your crap in the dryer all day and insist people don’t touch it. You should not apologize for doing a nice thing because she is insecure about her undies. If she’s so freaked out about it she shouldn’t be using machines that she doesn’t even pay the utilities for. In EVERY way they were wrong.

Frankly I would go back in and address how leaving her stuff in the dryer all day and insisting you leave it there when she is not even a roommate is unacceptable. Forget the “I won’t do it again” say if it happens again you will remove the laundry and put it on top of the dryer. That if you need the dryer in your own home you will use it. Don’t let them walk all over you."
ea0mex,"YTA. Your dad misses his home country, and he seized his chance to go over the holiday period. It doesn't mean he doesn't love you or the rest of the family, and his granddaughter is still pretty little to really enjoy Christmas. Don't punish him by not getting him a gift. But you could just (a) get him something small and easy to post, or (b) tell him you'll give him his gift when he gets home."
ea0p8k,"NTA

ea0r9x,"NAH. This is a really uncomfortable situation to be in. There is a reason voting for stuff like this is usually anonymous and in the small scale it's to not hurt anyone's feelings. You didn't do anything wrong for nominating your English teacher and your IT teacher was following proper procedure as acting vice by getting your vote. Them being disappointed is an unfortunate consequence of a bad situation. I don't think anyone here was acting in bad faith, so no assholes. That said... god this is awkward."
ea0se3,"YTA - you had no desire to be accountable before you broke up with your ex. This very much reads as you feeling lonely rather than actually having some desire to be a better person. 

Also - you apologized for YOUR feelings, not for hers. Never, ever apologize because you think it’ll make you feel better when you’re not sure if it’ll make the other person feel better. Then you’re doing it for yourself and not for them."

ea10rt,"YTA

You don’t call her wife, why should your niece or nephew call her aunt?"
ea11hs,"NAH but I think your husband has a point. I get that people love HP but is it really necessary to name your daughter after a character in one of the most famous books of the past decade? 

Idk, do what you want but I would personally want something more unique and meaningful.

Edit: yes I understand that it was a name before the book came out but pretty much no one cares or will associate the name with anything other than the book but again, you do you."
ea17ld,"YWBTA if you unloaded on her angrily. But it would be perfectly appropriate, and a boon to any future clientele in the same situation if you tell her that her questions were intrusive and offensive and that you were paying her for her tailoring skills, not to be subjected to an interrogation."
ea1b25,NTA Sounds miserable if you make the bitchy move be prepared for less invitations to social activities. You make valid points and I’m sure you feeling the way you feel is valid I hope you get to have some fun soon
ea1d5d,"NTA. You don't have to accept this woman into your family, she's not a member and you aren't obliged to treat her like one.

That seems to be a pretty harsh interpretation.  
Personally I would also be uncomfortable with a nudist lifestyle. Of course you should do what you want, but in order to make a relationship work, both people have to compromise. It may be that this is a deal-breaker for the whole ralationship, but that does not make anyone an asshole.  
NAH"
ea2m48,"NTA...to those saying yta really?? 

 Let’s not make any bones about this, the dog is old, settled in his day to day routine. Has those with whom he is familiar around. Your son wanting to take him, whilst he may have the best intentions, it’s not fair on Toby.
 Plus as you say, he was a family pet.

Editing to add: when I posted this comment over 5 hours ago, there were a couple of people calling op ta! I got this post early. So if ta post are gone, I can’t help that."
ea2mz3,"ESH

He shouldn’t have raised his voice but “He should be punished for disrespecting me” is ridiculous"
ea2shc,"ESH but you less than your spouse. She obviously sucks big time for not only having fads of extremism in various directions but also for including her whole family in them. The animal butchering video is just too much, too. You and your spouse both suck because both of you keep doing stuff behind your backs and asking the children to be accomplices in these lies.

ea3y3o,"NTA, he was put there for a reason. If he’s showing no change of character, his ex should be warned."
ea3ya6,"NAH.  She didn't say you were her second choice.  She said you guys are lucky that the situation lined up as she almost dated someone else around the time you two met.  I don't think she meant it at all the way your thinking, but I can understand why your bugging about it.  From my read of it, you need to take a deep breath and remember that she is choosing to be with you.  You guys have what you describe as a 'good' relationship.  She has a history before you guys got together and you do too.  Did you have anyone you were interested in dating around the time you met L?  It's not any different.  If you confront her about it, I think it'd be a mistake."
ea3yx9,"Welcome to having a baby. Everyone's exhausted and crabby and it sucks. NAH, this is all pretty normal tbh."
ea3zfg,"NTA

Maybe there's a bit of jealousy/nerves about the new baby at play here? Realistically, your kids have way shorter school days than anyone I know so I have to assume you're not in the US. My 5 year old starts at 8:40 and goes until 3:30, which is pretty standard."
ea49eq,"NTA.  

Showering before work is a normal thing.  And 6:30 is a perfectly appropriate time to take a shower.  If you were constantly taking them at 3am just for fun it might be weird, but I don’t think you have anything to feel bad about here.  No one wants a stinky coworker!"
ea4ajd,NTA: you can’t clean up urine when you’re working with/around food. That’s a huge sanitary no no. She should know that and do her own job.
ea4awg,YTA it's literally her cat. And it's unlikely that cuddling the cat triggered her asthma attack. I have asthma too and if it's going to get triggered it's not going to have a 12+ hour delay.
ea4bsq,NTA. Your SIL is TA.
ea4bzh,">I declined but she kept insisting that I should participate until she gave up and called me a grinch. AITA for refusing to participate?

NTA. You refused an optional event. You don't need a reason, and they've got no right to pester you over it."
ea4d4y,"ESH- you’re the asshole for holding a comment YOUR husband made against her. If you had a problem with your husband calling her hot, then the problem lies with the husband not the woman. She’s the asshole for commenting on your age. No one should talk negatively or judge other people’s pregnancy journey because it’s very personal and often very difficult. 

Do I think this is worth making every family event awkward and uncomfortable by holding on to this? No. So far it doesn’t seem as if you’ve approached her about her comments. You should sit her down and have a conversation about how you treat each other. It’s worth putting in the effort, and if she responds negatively, then you can say you tried to fix the relationship and she wasn’t open to it. As much as you don’t like someone, you gotta put in the effort to fix things at least one time because this puts the whole family in an awkward position. If that attitude isn’t reciprocated, then you have the right to continue ignoring her."
ea4dlq,"YTA and your mom is TA

If it weren't for the fact that you acknowledged your mom blatantly favored you, only she would be TA. This is the kind of shit that leaves families strained. You can appreciate what your mother does for you, and also stand up for your siblings who also get treated unfairly."
ea4e40,"NTA. They were right to be concerned about your wellbeing, but it was 15 seconds, and as pranks go, that was a good one.

ea5j26,"YTA for involving yourself so much in this. She's having the baby, not you. I understand being disapproving, having a baby as a teenager without a lot of financial support, and not living on your own, but those issues aren't really any of your concern.

this is called camping. your meal is over and you're now squatting on a table the restaurant needs to seat and feed more people. it's rude to the employees and it's rude to anyone waiting for that table.

a few minutes is fine, but a half hour is excessive. ""we're paying customers"" does not give you free reign to be an asshole."
ea5msp,"YTA. Have a frank conversation with your dad. Communicate these concerns to him. That y’all feel like you’ve tried, but that it seems like she’s totally disinterested. Maybe even say “you know, if she doesn’t want to come, it wouldn’t hurt my feelings if she decided to do something else, but know that the two of you are welcome.” Or maybe something like “hey, maybe this year drive separately, and if she doesn’t feel comfortable around us for long periods of time, she can leave early and you can stay a little longer? She just may not be comfortable with larger groups of people or in social settings. 

They are a package deal. I don’t think her behavior rises to the level of “she can’t come, but you can.” This would be a different situation if she arrived and always insulted or belittled everyone, or was hurtful. She, unfortunately for everyone it seems like, is a part of the family.

When he is stalking and harassing girls, does anyone do or say anything to address this behaviour? I'm really worried about how these girls fears and feelings might be being ignored and how badly this could escalate if not addressed.

To use your analogy, yes it is courteous to pay. However if no one steps up, and you don’t say anything, it’s tough to ask them once all the pizza is gone to pay. Because by the time consumption has started, the payment terms are locked in. 

You did the shopping, they had no say in what your purchased or made. Gathering money in advance and then shopped with that would have been ideal. 

I would ask them to lay off the leftovers however."

So, as someone who is more than a foot shorter than you, I dont think you're the asshole.

I attended a lot of alternative rock concerts when I was in high school as a 5 foot 2 inch 105lb girl. I've been squished into the front railing before to the point where I had bruises and it was hard to breathe for a few days afterwards. That being said, you got to your spot(from what I can tell) without shoving people out of the way, you followed the natural movement of the crowd as the bands switched. It's not your fault that this guy didn't do the same and find himself at a better position. Just because you're 6+ feet tall doesnt mean that you deserve any less of a concert experience than others. Short people aren't guaranteed front row spots and shouldnt expect a taller person to stand in the back of a crowd when one of their favorite bands are playing.

Your father has a right to know about your lives and what is happening in them. As collateral damage, you are now here asking us if you did a bad thing or not. That was also unfair of your mother.

I am sorry for your brother and hope that everything works out. For the immediate question--you were fine with what you did, but your mom was not."
eadwhz,"NTA. Please tell her it’s the wrong one. Or maybe you can exchange it after? You’re married, honesty is always best."
eae2a7,"NTA.  Adding a plus one is super inappropriate.  This falls under the “your wedding, your rules” part of planning an expensive party."
eae39e,"NTA, Get the hell out of there and find help.

Also look into counseling so you don't become the type of parents your's are."
eae3nc,NTA. I’m sick of these assholes in the city running red lights the wrong way then flipping me off for daring to be in the crosswalk
eae562,"YTA, have you met any six year olds? I wanted to be a cat at that age, only acted out cat books, and tried to wear cat ears to school. Guess who doesn’t do that anymore? Just let him be a weird little blonde spiderman, he’s hurting nobody including himself."
eae5vy,NTA If it's not much work then he can do it himself.
eaebwd,Info why doesnt the SO take the pets until you can live together again?
eaed9y,NTA- Wow he laughed at you? You know what? Go get you a nice hotel room for the weekend and catch up on sleep. It’s beyond ridiculous that you get woke up so many times on a normal night much less when you are in pain. Fuck that noise. Order room service and stretch out and don’t feel bad about it one bit.
eaef3w,"Key words


Expect,  


YTA.  Don't expect anything, don't assume you are owed..."
eaeiu0,"I'm sorry YTA. 

I'm just gonna be honest with you. Things are A LOT different nowadays. Your kids cannot and will not be able to do things the way you were. Your only concern needs to be their happiness and only that. Regardless of marriage, job, schooling, etc; you will not understand how it is for them. Please don't jepordize your relationship with them over your own opinions."
eaekfa,YTA. Your dad is letting you live there rent free and you can’t even help out with food that you will eat or other bills that you benefit from?
eaesuz,Dude stop corresponding with your therapist about this stuff and report her to whatever board oversees her practice. She needs to have her license revoked for multiple reasons.
eaetu7,"NTA. It’s not bad that he openly discusses it with friends, but the strangers trying to eat food generally don’t like hearing about anyone’s bodily functions or secretions. Regardless of whether it’s about a wet dream, shitting one’s pants, or even bleeding from a cut finger, there’s a time and place. A public eatery isn’t the place."
eaexkp,"Must be a nice gym if your mandated to shower before working out.

eaf84w,"NTA. It is, generally speaking, good to prevent children from snorting a bunch of fucking coke or whatever."
eaf9kx,"NTA. Ultimately, it's *your* money. She's already being enabled by still living at home at her age. That said, do you feel she will even be able to stick to a budget? As in, would your efforts (even if she agrees) be followed, or would her condition cause her to drop out at the first stressor? I ask because it's worth the self reflection if it's worth the potential strain versus just saying ""sorry sis, I don't have $50 right now"""
eaf9lv,"You didn’t break up a marriage because you cheated, she did. He’s old enough to not be babied. That being said, hopefully looking into some kind of therapy to process this with an outside perspective/professional would be a good way to help him deal with the frustrations and sadness he is experiencing."
eaf9ng,Is this super secret christmas thing for you maybe? She was rude but I wouldn't make a huge deal out of it quite yet.
eafdi1,"NTA ... but ... 

Is $20 really that important to you? I'd consider it a lesson learned and not split anymore ubers w/ this guy."
eafe7n,"NTA 

This is workplace harassment ... I probably wouldn't be discussing feelings w/ people calling me 'pig' either."
eafe8e,"NTA 

I don't think you need to forgive to 'move on' ... You're setting boundaries and there's absolutely nothing wrong w/ that."

You're doing the right thing by taking a stand."
eafeoi,"NTA. ""That's how he gets."" Your co-workers are okay with sexual harassment because he does that every fucking year? And your boss thinks an e-mail apology is what rectifies it? Yeah normalizing sexual harassment is not a good thing. They're definitely the asshole here.

eafj5s,"NTA - Your instincts seem really good. Set boundaries the same way you've been doing. Do NOT go over finances with him at all! Let him blow hot air out of his mouth just keep doing you, Boo."
eafklt,"NTA, your parents need to lighten up before you wind up with a permanent injury from overworking your body for a game."
eafn4q,NTA you worked and should be paid for it. That’s like me buying a loaf of bread and not using it all before it goes bad and asking for a refund.
eafrc4,"Eh, NTA. It's his responsibility. That said, you're not being a team player here. Should've dumped water on him."
eafrzy,NAH - Things change. When you and your job are no longer compatible it’s perfectly normal to move on with appropriate notice.
eafsjh,No you are NTA in this situation at all. I have never had a child but I have been there when a few of my close friends have given birth... no one wants a crowd!!! Your POA for this birth sounds great! If you all are there the day of the birth I’m sure she will appreciate it... I think mothers need more help AFTER they get out of the hospital.. like those first few weeks so maybe if you explain it to him like that he will understand.  And I can completely understand why you are so excited for this Christmas with you being able to actually enjoy it .
eafyre,ESH - You all need to grow up. Being petty and shite.
eafz87,"NTA but you could be if you are rude about it.

This is a super tricky situation. 

You have every right to want to be celebrated on your special day, especially for a party that had so much effort put into its careful planning. You don't deserve to be brushed off once again for unforeseen circumstances outside of your control.

Your grandmother being in the hospital is a big deal to your parents, your party is a big deal to you. They can't expect you to cancel and not feel put out, and you can't expect them to not want to be there for her in her time of need.

 You said your grandma was admitted but not critical. If she was, I'd say you don't have a choice but to postpone. Since that's not the case, another adult can be at the party to ""supervise"" to satisfy your parents. You can also be sympathetic and mature by taking a little time during your party to check in with them on how things are going and show your love for your parents, even though you have little for your grandma."
eafzan,"NTA, it's not like you're hurting anyone.

Personally, as a trans guy, when I was younger I would always make my online character male. Did I feel like I was lying to people? Sometimes but male is my true gender and I'd be lying to myself /and/ people if I said I was 100℅ a girl."
eag03w,"NTA. It hurts when people whom you thought were your friends let you down. There are many reasons someone can't make a wedding. But he sounded like he couldn't be bothered at any step of the way. Like he literally gave no fucks at all. You were not asking him to go above and beyond--just the normal things a groomsman would do. Like RSVP and you know, show up. That hurts. I

f I were in your shoes I, too, would be seriously reevaluating the friendship. Congrats on your nuptials, and if I were you, I'd start a slow fade."
eag6z3,NTA. I’ve lost a child. I’ve also lost dogs whom have been like children to me. They really aren’t comparable. As a matter of fact that’s one of those things on every list of what not to say to a parent who has lost a child. For her to share her story was one thing. For her to say that she knows how a grieving mother feels because she lost her dog was another and inappropriate however well intended. She needed to be set straight before she said that to someone else who has lost a child who might have really torn into her.
eag73l,NTA- pretty sure that's borderline sexual assault. Let alone the complete and utter disrespect he showed your partner and in turn you.
eag7mc,"NAH but I’d reconsider if I were you. Your family does have reason to be worried: even non combat can accidentally hurt you - people do sometimes die in basic training accidents, and my own grandfather just did clerical work but is still permanently half deaf bc a moron fired a rifle right by his head. There are many places where excellent work ethic like the kind you’re describing would be heavily appreciated and you could still benefit the country - like being a surveyor, for instance"
eag7oi,"Your mom is an asshole.  I hope you are able to stay with your father. She's so deep into her addiction, you can't help her and its not your job. Save your money, keep it safe. Move out forever and never go back to living with your mom if you can avoid it."
eag7yf,"Soft YTA, I get that you were trying to comfort her but she was definitely being the AH by criticizing this guy’s girlfriend’s weight and whether this girl is worthy of her freaking boyfriend. It comes across as though your daughter is being entitled and having the impression that she’s better than this girl (who btw is a total stranger to her....but because she’s “fat” she’s unworthy) pretty crappy attitude to have. You reassuring her that she’s too good for this guy kind of fuels that entitlement. You’re enabling pretty awful immature behavior in your daughter."
eag8d6,"If you’re going to be a doctor, you’re likely going to have to develop the ability to tell people difficult things. Why not start now?

What you’re doing sounds to me like fearful avoidance and immaturity.  I do believe you’re in the wrong so, for the purposes of this sub, YTA."
eag8v6,NTA he took total advantage of you while your mom was sick in the hospital. In my opinion that guy is a total douchbag and I hope you stand up for yourself and let everyone know what he did that makes you never want to bargain with him again.
eagbyu,"NTA - You can’t really control your feelings, especially when you’ve already been resenting their fuckups and then they snap at you. Managers should ideally learn how to control themselves and if they need to unload be able to prepare people for that state of mind so that it doesn’t have a large impact, especially on the people who report to them."
eagczy,ESH. Your wife sucks for giving him a prescription that wasn’t prescribed to him. You suck for being controlling and comparing the mother of your children to a babysitter.

eagebe,"YTA - welcome to marriage, hanging out with your husband/wife and their family even when you don’t want to. Not going would be a tremendously huge dick move.

Ever wondered why there are are so many in law jokes? Well, now ya know."
eaggqo,"NTA

Although your mom is definitely TA. Good on you for standing up for your sister; even if it doesn't necessarily change things immediately, it lets your sister know that she's not in the wrong and that what your mom's doing is screwed up."
eaghx8,"YTA.  Your are the boss and you often ""talk shop "" when you have lunch together. You get to expense your ""turn "" but he can't. This is why the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer."
eagklx,NTA tell her not to come immediately. She will embarrass you in front of your employer and potentially hurt your career.
eagkqz,YTA. Why not try to set a better example for your child and find a family activity that doesn't include the tv instead of isolating your daughter because of a habit you enabled.
eagks8,"NAH c’mon she’s a little protective of her baby and you’re doing nothing wrong. let her see a few more times that the baby is totally fine, even when crying"
eagms2,[deleted]
eagmsd,"NTA, that’s really rude considering your situation"
eagnpk,"Crush? What are you, twelve?

As for this gem: 

>am i the asshole for getting jealous bc of her when i've had nine whole months of opportunity to try to cuff him lmao

You're attracted to this guy, but you haven't had the courage to let him know, but somehow NONE of your friends are allowed to consider him attractive because... what?... you've called dibs?

YTA

[edit to add]

> the best response ive gotten so far is somebody calling me 12 for referring to them as my CRUSH BAHAHA what else do i call it ?? 

Call it attraction. Say you are attracted to the guy. Heck, even saying ""I have a crush on this guy"" would be better.

He's not ***your*** crush. There's no ownership or obligation."
eagpxa,"NTA, essential oils are not regulated by the FDA and are not a food product, therefore they shouldn't be eaten or put in food. You have every right to be upset, and I personally would stop eating food that she cooks, although that might be an overreaction/might lead to a bigger problem."
eagrzl,"NTA

If they're going to give you shit for ordering a tea and then just completely forgetting your order/not taking it, you damn right you're not going to get them their coffee. It feels like an overeaction to cancelling the whole thing but it feels like management wanted an excuse for it. Although the Kuerig seems a little petty but that's fine by me since I can be petty as hell.


Edit to OP's edit: Be extra petty and let the other new guy use your Keurig and tell him your circumstances. Everyone will ask him what's up with him getting coffee and he'll tell them your side of the story in turn they'll see being assholes got them where they're at now.  Although you might get in some hot water for that.

P.S Like I said, I'm petty as fuck"
eagtax,are you guys in second grade
eagthu,"NTA. 

Why the emphasis on ""solving things like men""? Does he want to have a pistol duel behind the barn over a quotation mark?"

eah6pr,"NTA. It goes without saying. If you break somebody else's property, accidentally or not, you owe it to them to pay for the damages or replacement should the owner tell you to pay."
eah786,"NTA. If you help her, that will only teach her to come to you when she spends all her money stupidly. Having to go to a soup kitchen or food bank is probably the reality check she needs."
eah9yq,"NTA - If a woman wrote her husband was calling at work every hour, confronting her when she was the least little bit late, and using physical/space intimidation methods, everyone would say ""run"". He is controlling and emotionally abusive. Just because she is a woman and you are a man does not make this any different. Calling every hour to see if you are alright is not caring, concern, or loving too much. It is controlling. She isn't talking to you because you stood up for yourself and let her know you won't be controlled. She is likely just biding her time until she finds another approach. Stay safe - physically AND emotionally."
eahb4w,"NTA. You didn't even directly implicate your brother. You just made it so he couldn't cheat. Now he's going to actually have to learn the material in order to do well. Frankly, I'm proud of you. Hard choice, but the right one."
eahckh,YTA  because it’s none of your business. You didn’t need to comment like that. She probably wouldn’t have said anything about you if you didn’t start on her first.
eahjtz,"nope.  thats fair.  730..really.  fuck off.  thats inconsiderate

thanks for the silver.  i would say more but im banned."
eahl72,"NTA.

You say that these students are not doing their work, right?  If they’re not willing to put in the work to actually learn the material, then, they’re wasting both their time and yours.  I know you’re paid for your services but even so, you could be using that time to teach another student who does want to learn and needs your help."
eahm35,YTA dude don't be a fucking snitch. Maybe have a talk with him about the potential implications and repercussions but tattling to your parents will only serve to distance your relationship with him and you're supposed to look out for each other. There's nothing wrong with him exploring his sexuality and if you don't have a problem with it why would you betray him like that?
eahrla,"NTA, he should have picked her up when she called, his show could wait. Not a good sign for the future."
eahrmu,NTA- Explain to her Pugs are nearly always adopted from shelters and will be taken to a much better home. Other breeds are often put down because people are scared of them or dont find them as cute and she could have the chance to save one.

eahwbc,"NTA - I dj hip hop and R&B, if he has a set list that’s preplanned and he cant change it and won’t take requests from the crowd then he’s a shitty dj. He doesn’t have to play the song but he should at least listen to you. 

If you ask for a song that’s a completely different genre then you are wrong but in this case he’s a pretentious douchebag. Also if he’s doing a live set where he’s mashing up songs or playing with a sampler etc then you would be wrong but if he’s just playing other artists’ songs then there’s nothing wrong with you asking."
eahwh5,NTA It’s an invasion of your privacy. You’re allowed to be upset.
eai490,"NTA. A lot of individuals wear modest clothing because it makes the more comfortable. As long as you aren't wearing a religious symbol of some kind in order to purposefully misidentify yourself as another religion, it shouldn't matter what kind of clothing you wear."
eai4b4,"YTA. You've acknowledged that David doesn't like sharing food or drinks but you think it's okay to use his toothbrush, especially without asking first especially after only dating for a short period of time? I'm in agreement with David on this one. That was gross."
eaifir," remember it's the first thing an abuser does is isolate thier victim  from support of friends and family. This is because they know that friends and family will encourage the person to leave. At the moment your friends mind is twisted to belive you are the enemy even though you aren't. The abuser wants you to end your friendship with her, you're playing into his hands. It won't shock her into leaving. She has to make up her own mind in her own time. As has been already said, mute Instagram. 

I've been in the same situation as you. You've done all you can do. Stand back and be ready to support her when she leaves. I know It's beyond frustrating but you've done all you can do."
eailtz,"You didn't get her fired, her actions did. NTA, but what did you expect there to happen"
eaiu7g,"YTA you are late to work and somehow blame your boss, your boss is trying to get people to work but you didn’t indicate you weren’t available as requested, then you throw a fit when your mistake is pointed out.  Way too dramatic.  Your boss didn’t do or say anything inappropriate, he just called you on your crap."
eaix49,"NTA. This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. Your boyfriend is insecure and controlling. I’d suggest that you ask him exactly how far you are allowed to travel without his prior permission, then dump him while he’s trying to think of an answer."
