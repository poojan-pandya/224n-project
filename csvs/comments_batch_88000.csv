e30jpk,NTA- You have a duty to protect the kids. Period. At the end of the day you gave her a choice and she made that choice. I feel for her family but you have to take care of the kids and they deserve a sober mom.
e30js3,"YTA - It sounds like you’ve already played it for any friends who would “benefit.” The funeral where his family is getting closure would not be an appropriate repeat. 

You also mentioned depression and perhaps his state of mind when he created it versus how he may have felt later are different. You can’t prove how he would feel today but you do know how his family would feel. Err on the side of caution and don’t play it."
e30t90,"YTA because youdiscussed her going with you if you go, and now you're going andyou don't want to take her with you because you just don't want her there? So it's not even about the ride, it's about you not wanting her at the store she sells art at. So if she gets there through other means (an actual friend, public transport,...) you'll still be upset?"
e30ts6,"**YTA**. Christmas is not always about giving gifts and expecting something in return. Also, how dare you punish your niece and nephew just because their parents are not giving you something in return. 

However, I would need some more **INFO** about your niece and nephew's ages, because it would make a huge difference."
e30tvt,"NTA - you and your boyfriend have plans to visit your family. He goes back on your plans to ask if he can see his family instead. He gets upset because you let your parents know that his plans had changed. 

Your boyfriend is immature and needs to make up his mind"
e30u1y,"There isn't a magical rule that says that children aren't allowed in first class, it's just that few parents can afford to do so. I suspect that it was a new situation for everyone involved.

NTA, but expect death stares in the future."
e30ueh,"Nta

But you should talk to the rest of them about why. They might be just as sick of him."
e30uou,"I’m sorry but I’d have to say YTA for denying her the process to heal, you didn’t want to be with her and lied about it. Yeah it would of hurt but she would of had a chance to get over it and fled the pain instead of months later relapsing you’re lying and still feeling bad about it"
e30w31,NTA - especially considering all the circumstances I think it’s only right that you’re pre-warned before his arrival. I know I’d be scared personally
e31521,"NTA. If someone is consistently rude or hurtful to you as an adult you can choose not to see them, I can't see why this would be any different at 16. 

Say to your Mum 'I am not going because..' and leave it at that. It's up to her what she says to your aunt, but it's not really your concern."
e31i0i,"NTA. Sometimes it’s hard for people to notice if they’re having issues with personal hygiene— like BO or stinky breath. I think he’d rather hear it from a friend than from a stranger, and as long as you’re kind and not pushy about it."
e31jzy,"You should carry uninsured/underinsured coverage on your car. This means in the event there is a collision, YOU are covered.

He is an unsafe driver! He doesn't have insurance! What were you *thinking?* Of COURSE you should have reported it! Luckily no one was injured, but what about next time? My God man, he SHOULD NOT BE OPERATING A MOTOR VEHICLE!

If I get downvoted for this, ok, but an unsafe, uninsured driver is a risk to EVERYONE on the road. 

YTA"
e31mrk,"NAH

Whoever is missing their package will more than likely take steps to get a replacement or refund. 

You don’t need them and donating them is an excellent option."
e31nos,"NAH. There is nothing wrong with saying, “hey I love you, but I don’t have the energy or funds do to this round trip every weekend.” And he’s not an asshole for wanting to see you. Explain why you want to lessen the frequency of trips with care, and truly listen to how he feels about it as well. I do think you can meet in the middle though. Maybe you can keep making these weekly trips but he can pick up a part-time job to help you pay for gas? Or actually, physically, meet somewhere in the middle for an inexpensive date once or twice a weekend? 

On a side note, seriously do not try to stay in another student’s dorm long-term. If he school found out (which would be pretty likely in that kind of a living situation), your boyfriend could be in big trouble."
e31pya,"NTA, you should report the incident to HR"
e31sho,NAH  Your aunt asked for help and you said no.  You are an adult and she doesn't have to invite you to her house for Thanksgiving or any other day and you don't have to split wood for her.  You want thanksgiving without helping out then make your own or go out to eat.
e31srv,NTA he can listen to music in kitchen or back yard or head phones
e31szf,"NAH- but Ross, is that you? But seriously, if it’s not a huge sum of money, I’d just participate and earn some goodwill."
e31xkv,"This is a lot of info but a really simple answer. You’re NTA for the exact reasons you list. She’s a stranger to everybody. She could be a dude for all anybody knows. You’re sweet to care so much about dad’s online life. Keep it up, he needs it. Sheesh. And congratulations on your baby."
e3205a,NTA. You *have* got your priorities straight and she is not number 1 ( not should she be). She'll just have to get used to that.
e322f9,Whoever designed ring 2 is actually TA.  That thing is appalling.
e323mb,Tbf it's good you went back you shouldnt leave extra food for dogs while you're away I guess it wasnt loads as you didnt expect to be away for days at a time but cats can moderate themselves dogs dont always tend to do that.
e324jz,"NTA. 
My cat also yells at me when I don’t let him inside right away. He has an excuse though, like not having thumbs or a pocket to keep a key. What’s your roommate’s excuse?"
e325op,Nta. Just because a parent choose a new partner doesn’t mean you have to deal with ‘em.
e328u0,NAH- you'd been behaving strangely and you had her pills in your drawer...that's the natural conclusion to come to. And addicts aren't the most honest about their drug use. They freaked out and that's only natural when you have a history of depression that they would think you could be self-medicating. You have the right to be upset but you can see why they thought you would.
e3297d,"NTA, do it. Controlling abusive people need to be taken down a notch"
e32jvq,"NTA

She'll get over it when she needs you to do her an unreasonable favor again. :) Trust me."
e32k33,"NTA. That's a pretty significant fever, and there's a good chance the others may have caught it and just aren't experiencing symptoms yet. Holidays are all about sharing, but not when it comes to illnesses lol."
e32num,NTA Entirely reasonable to watch your cats weight.
e32plb,"ESH.

Is it too late for Jane to beg Jolene not to take her man?"
e32q3u,"YTA - I was struggling with this one because I know you were trying to do the right thing by being honest, but you knew he was grounded and you let him go and then you told on him - that wasn't right. You either should have said ""no"" or let him go and kept it between the two of you. Now you're stuck in the middle :("
e32x09,"NAH except for your mom.

It is not your wife of her family's fault that your mom changed plans at the last minute. You should have honored the plans that were already in place."
e32ynd,"YTA - Sometimes it takes time to process the sharpness of insults because of the adrenaline in the moment.  Laughter is a common reaction to being uncomfortable and doesn't always mean everything is okay.

What you said was disrespectful."
e32yvk,"NTA. It’s not your job to support your friends lifestyle. It sounds like you have an unspoken arrangement, so it’s time to tactfully revisit said arrangement; ie “I’m trying to cut back,” “Funds are a little low,” “I’ll buy specifically for you next time I’m home, but I’m going to need the cash up front.”"
e330b3,"I kinda lean towards YTA. You keep saying for them to “get a room” well they have one and they are using it. And jolly well good for them. Telling them that they shouldn’t have sex when you are home is wrong. You could have just said “ Hey look, the walls are a little thin in this house. My room is right next to your room.”
 I get it’s weird for you OP but honestly your parents being so into each other is kinda endearing to me. And good for them.
 Also, your dad is right, you were disrespectful. You don’t get to dictate to them if you get another sibling.

Edit: spelling."
e331a9,"NTA. The idea that you, an intern, one of the lowest paid person in the company (if you get paid at all), should use your money to buy something for one of the higher paid people in the company is profoundly stupid. Not only should YOU not get your boss a gift, none of the interns should."
e331op,[deleted]
e3348o,NTA. She agrees then lies for an extended period of time before revealing you cant do it your way and your unable to cancel and now must pay for pictures you didnt agree to. Shows she had little respect in that situation.
e337x1,"NTA, you're right to stand up against a bigot, even and especially among your own. But INFO, does the rest of your family share her opinion?"
e33d0s,"NTA...except why did you let your girlfriend put a FOUR YEAR OLD in timeout for an hour and a half? That’s absolutely insane.

Update to OPs Update:  I hope there’s a timeframe attached to this new arrangement.  What if she never feels better about it?  I think that’s a bad call.   Glad you’re going to look into grief therapy though."
e33dr9,"NTA - if you hadn't put that money into the house whose to say of your mother would have had it?

Your siblings will disagree, but just because you are ""somewhat well off"" it does not mean you should be losing out"
e33nw1,"YTA. It's still a very personal experience, even if someone doesn't keep it shrouded in secrecy. The fact that she advocates for reproductive rights isn't ""bragging,"" it's advocating. 

The fact that she's proud of the fact that she has reproductive rights and was able to exercise them is also not ""bragging."" It's *exercising the reproductive rights that she's proud and fortunate to have*.

Like damn. That's not something for you to share with other people."
e33nx8,"esh and you should stand up for yourself instead of missing out on all the food. You already did everything, you might as well enjoy the good part.  For Christmas, say no to cleaning- it’s simple"
e33qnf,"YTA. She should be going to a therapist or the psych ward if you’re that concerned, not a church. Seriously? Especially if she’s not religious previously."
e33rrm,"NTA your wedding your rules, but be prepared for the fact she might not want to come."
e33svb,"YTA

having him bail on his pre-planned family visit would make him a bigger asshole (to them) than he would be by 'bailing' on you to stick to the plan"
e33uul,"NAH about the dream.  Good to use the  energy in a way you and wife enjoyed.  

Y T A, in my opinion  for letting your friend in on the secret."
e33wzn,"Holy crap NTA. You would be TA if you didn’t. A lot of times women don’t feel comfortable or safe speaking up, especially when it’s someone in a position of power. Not everyone is capable of it, or has been conditioned not to. It’s our responsibility as people to stand up for each other."
e33x5h,"NTA. If she’s not in the photos AT ALL, you don’t have to take them down."
e3402q,"NTA, its not like you are even living there, and you are 26, you are supposed to make a living and create a life for yourself not clean up after your mothers misstakes"
e3424n,"YTA

Consideration is consideration... Do you really have to be told to walk slower to stay by her? Honestly.

INFO: what do you gain by walking faster than her?"
e343p1,NTA She wants to be the center of attention. I had an employee that used to crochet during meetings. At first it bothered me but she got all info needed and remembered better than I did most of the time. Go forth and crochet!
e345ja,"NTA. You're partner is 100% the asshole, especially since you always spend holidays with his family."
e3473i,"This might be controversial...but at 4 months old most babies look the same and are not easily identified. This might just be my opinion but pictures of me at 4 months old, I would not be able to look at it and know it was me. Obviously I would know what MY baby looks like in a lineup of a million babies but I wouldn't be able to pick YOUR baby out, especially if I met your child when they were 10+. So I'm going to go with NAH because it is your baby therefore your choice. But I do think you may be overthinking it a little."
e347hj,[deleted]
e34971,"NTA. It’s common to pay more if you have a bigger room/better room than everyone else. In the house I lived in with my roommates we all paid different amounts based on room size, and especially with having an own bathroom it’s very reasonable!"
e34b1z,"Going against the grain to say YWBTA.  No matter what the mom's mental illnesses and struggles may be, it is inappropriate for you to clean her house without permission.  Now don't get me wrong, I don't think that what you've described is right or healthy, but kicking in someone's door, going through their things, and changing them around is not okay.  Your choice in the matter is not what the state of someone else's home is, it is whether or not you want to stay there at all - if I were you, I wouldn't agree to it."
e34fae,"NTA, he’s a huge part of your life and you shouldn’t have to pretend he doesn’t exist if it comes up organically"
e34hle,"You may have to ask for help or even assign help (eg: you do the turkey, hubby does some sides, etc)... or you may have to have a holiday blow up and go on strike.

We normally host, and we work out in advance which guests are coming and what they’re bringing. I’ll do the main (smoked turkey, ham, whatever) and others will do the sides. 

No single person should have to do everything.

NTA."
e34mmb,"NAH, but it's probably best to accept them and then replace them when they break, which can happen as soon as you'd like."
e34nch,"While I believe you are in the right here....it strikes me if you follow through it's one of those many, little ways that a couple kills all the love out of a marriage."
e34q9e,"I don't think you'll be an asshole, but I also don't think it's a good idea.  I'd talk to the host parents before confronting the host sister.  Something tells me that she will NOT take it well if you do."
e34s2d,"A tip, separate paragraphs for easier reading.

Nta. You don't have to go. Also I would tell your parents because they should know."
e34tb8,"NTA, but ask yourself, are you his gf or his mum?"
e34tt1,"NTA. Your sister needs to grow up. First she should not assume  she is entitled to your stuff based on her or anyone's analysis of your current degree of use of stuff. This sounds like a preteen spat over last years toy. Second as your sister she really should not befriend your ex-husband out of respect for your feelings, especially immediately after divorce. Third if she does befriend your ex-husband she should sure as sh*t realize that he cannot speak for your stuff. And the ex is having boundary issues, and hasn't fully understood the meaning of ""ex"""
e34wis,"NAH but you should make it up to her somehow. Not your fault your dogs got sick and I’m guessing she doesn’t hold it against you, but yah, it did kinda mess up thanksgiving so maybe invite her over to dinner at some point or send her a bottle of wine with a pic of your dog and a card that says “sorry we are a bird and you didn’t” :)"
e34ybi,"NTA. 

Your mom is breaking your family apart. She chose to marry and have kids with a man she wasn’t in love with, and in doing so she risked the happiness of her husband and her children. There’s no excuse for that, whether she was still in the closet or not. 

She cheated on your dad, and your dad is a more devoted parent than she is. Go with your gut."
e353lk,"Majorly YTA

>I don't think it's his role to meddle in this 

If it's not his role to meddle, why is it his role to buy the cigarettes?"
e356go,"NTA - it's your dog and you taught it in a way that was convenient to you. If the signals are easy to pick up, then it's not really a problem as you can show anyone who needs to the signs. Why would random strangers be commanding your dog anyway?"
e359k8,"NTA. Your father is an asshole, excluding a kid from a fucking wedding is literally pointless."
e35arx,"So you are in one line, your gf is in a line, and your wife is in a line? 🤔"
e35c06,"NAH 

holy high school, Batman"
e35dvy,"NTA. I cannot believe you let yourself get railroaded into a day you didn't want in the first place. It's YOUR special day, not your families. They were totally out of order and you absolutely deserve to have a beautiful day. Get it booked!"
e35iec,"NTA

A hypothetical offer of eggs made a few years ago to a third party is not a firm offer made in current circumstances to the person who needs the eggs. Your previous possible willingness, if it was brought up at all without you there, should have been presented as a possibility to follow up, not as something you'd promised last week. They did not have the right to commit you to that hypothetical willingness.

Even if you did make an actual offer years ago, it's now. You can change your mind for many reasons. Yes, that change might upset people, but it's your right to decide whether and to whom you donate eggs."
e35l3b,"If this is true, NTA. Your GF is a massive asshole for putting your kink out on social media."
e35muj,"YTA and it may be illegal. Your aunt works for that person under the assumption of trust. Rich people are extremely cautious about their privacy. You violated their privacy and effed with the trusted relationship between your aunt and her employer.

Did you take the video down?

Also, thinking that just cuz everyone on reddit does it, doesnt mean that it's legal. There are hundreds of illegal videos on Reddit.

Further, you have NO idea what was identifiable. What if they had one-of-a-kinds? That's a great way to identify stuff. What if they had stuff that was precious yet highly stealable?

**An OUNCE of common sense** woulda helped you in this situation."
e35vik,"YTA

You expected everyone else to wait 40 minutes and eat what you admit was “cold dinner.”

Perhaps you should host if you don’t want to travel?

I have been the one stuck hosting holidays for many years.  If someone is not there when dinner is served, they get leftovers.  That’s how it is."
e35w6k,"Obviously NTA. The gf is manipulative and has probably convinced your friend of going her way, against you. You're just being a good friend imo"
e35ygw,[deleted]
e35z0g,I’m gonna say NTA it’s your kid. You get to decide who kisses your kid and who doesn’t. He shouldn’t have let her kiss your kid especially with how nasty you say she is.
e35z0y,"NAH.  Tell him that you’re concerned for his health.  If need be, offer to show him the relevant information."
e3612b,"NTA but your mum and dad are.  Why in the name of god would your mother defer to your father's decision?  They're not married any more, you and her had a financial plan organised and you don't need any input from him.  She needs to shiny up her spine and make decisions for herself. It has nothing whatsoever to do with him. 

Your father sounds like a. A-grade arsehole. She's well rid of him. And no,  you're not TA for cutting him out of your life."
e361wp,"NTA but honestly it's easier to identify people with behaviour you disagree with and ignore/avoid them... than it is to lecture them into some sort of change. You don't get to dictate her social etiquette, but you can stay clear of her if she doesn't meet your standard. You might have pressed the issue more than necessary.

One time I was driving around with a friend who threw a can out if my window into the lawn of a business we stopped near. I insisted she get out and pick it up. Unacceptable! I concede that I wasn't being nice. 

Maybe our actions had an impact but, as I've gotten older, I now consider it a waste of time to try and impact the casual friend in this way."
e361yr,"NTA
You can and should share this information. Now your coworker has leverage to get a raise that she probably deserves."
e361z7,"I think this isn’t really about the gifts fully. You say you’re parents don’t care as much about your daughter as they do about your son, and that makes them assholes.  Idk how you’d go about trying to bridge the gap and get to the bottom of why they don’t seem to care but I think it might be important to do so before daughter gets older and starts to feel a cold shoulder from them.

NTA"
e362qa,YTA.  There is no way this is going to damage your car.  Cars are constantly used with uneven weight distribution.  My husband weighs 215ish pounds and constantly drives around by himself.  Those weight limits are very likely to be EXTREMELY conservative.
e363j0,NTA. Innocent kids don’t have anything to do with their parents mistakes. WTF is wrong with your family??
e366d0,"YTA, this is a completely valid arrangement that the person with the biggest room pays more."
e368w8,"NTA, not sure why he's trying to guilt trip you into not going"
e36dlq,">*""I told her she dishonored our agreement""*

For goodness' sake.


Surely this is a shitpost? Nobody **REALLY** interacts with the person they love and want to share life with, in these sorts of terms?


If this story is true, YTA."
e36f3j,"NTA. Dude, your folks sound possessive and crazy af."
e36g9a,NTA. Knowingly letting people eat recalled food is unprofessional and unnecessarily lazy. You aren’t wrong to refuse to work somewhere that would do something like that.
e36g9v,"NTA. If you really have asked that many times and it is never going to stop, you kinda either be her maid or do what you're doing. I'd do the same"
e36s03,NTA he could've informed you earlier to cancel of they had been a bit sick for the last couple of days.
e36tax,"NTA for one reason- the kid’s mom said NO, so why in the world would it be okay now for the child to use someone else’s phone?"
e36ukk,ESH if for no reason than I wasted ten seconds reading this trivial junior high garbage
e36uly,"I think giving a dog away for free can be risky if you dont know the person - they could be used as a bait dog for dog fighting or something. A person willing to pay for a dog is more likely to treat it well imo. That should be your reasoning behind a price, not wanting the money. 
NTA in this instance, but don't get another animal until you are willing to commit to it for its life."
e36xp6,"NAH - whilst you’re not the arsehole for asking him to push the button, I can understand his annoyance. If you would have justified your asking him to do it by saying something like “oh sorry I thought this was my floor, can you press ground floor for me please” any anger from him would have been less justified

However the use of just the term “ground floor please” sounds on the surface of it like there is some expectance of him to press the button for you, and he probably interpreted it as an entitled demand, rather than a polite request. IMO, just a misinterpretation of the situation"
e36xsf,NAH. It’s doubtful that kids that age are really going to notice that they received fewer gifts - they’re just going to be excited about the ones they do receive.
e36z7g,YTA for texting something like this at the last minute. Cancelling on family on a holiday should at least be done through a telephone call so you can explain what’s going on thoroughly.
e371fa,"Yta, keep drama off the internet and stuff. General rule of thumb, not just because you’re making stuff public, inviting people not involved to get involved, but also putting things out there you might not be able to take back because they’re documented"
e376qu,NTA - She shared it so she should have expected some shape or form of a response and you told her the truth. It seems like a bad situation so you told her.
e377z9,"NTA. The child is 2. He is altogether too young to be exposed to the dismembering and evisceration of an animal. It is a scary, messy, bloody thing that no child needs to see until they are old enough to understand that meat is animals and aren’t afraid of the sight of blood or sharp implements."
e37aau,"NTA

Do your parents realize how much drama having Jacob and his father there could cause? Asking someone else to use their social function as a way to try and force a reconciliation is unbelievably inappropriate. Tell your parents that it's a bad idea to do this for a lot of reasons. If they really want to insert themselves in this other family's drama, then they can invite them over at some other time and not risk them blowing up your annual holiday party."
e37age,"ESH 

You reneged on your promise. They didn't get (everything) you asked for. Doesn't everything have tổ be shipped into alaska? I thought supplies were relatively limited unless you order with the next shipment"
e37ayf,"NAH

As a parent of a sixteen year old, I worry when my kid gets hurt. I probably wouldn’t have gotten the neighbor involved, but I would have said that if your eye looked worse the next day, you’d be going to the doctor. You’re at the age where you’re wanting a level of independence, and I get that, but your mom wants to make sure you’re not injured too badly."
e37bnx,"YTA, sorry.  When your boss at work is sick do you still expect a paycheck?  Yes, you do.  Just like your sitter should be paid even if you're sick.  She's providing an agreed upon service and has bills to pay, even if you're sick.  You're an employer, not a relative, not a friend."
e37eub,nobody wants to hear shit like that in a time of panicking/being frantic/the last minute. joking or not i wouldn’t have said it lol. but of course she was panicking so of course her reaction could vary. torn between a very soft yta and NAH
e37kq4,"NAH

Tell your brother the entire truth, that your son doesn't want a relationship with him, and you lied because you thought he would come around. 

Hopefully, he will forgive you and understand how his nephew feels. I know it seems likely he will still be angry, but at least he has the truth."
e37ml1,"NTA - Its a family ""relic""(???) putting in a young childs room puts it at huge risk."
e37v3m,"NTA.

Used TVs sell for *a fraction* of their retail price. You wouldn’t have gotten a lot of money for it anyway."
e37v3g,"NTA, but it sounds like it was a bad idea to move out there. You don't mention your bf standing up for you, so I'm going to assume he doesn't. If you stay in this relationship you can expect to deal with this everytime you interact with his parents. Get out now."
e37xy5,"YTA

Your younger daughter needs to be assessed IMMEDIATELY. It's not normal nor typical to have these reactions to things like the dark or heights. That being said, there is no way she needed both of you. If you have conditioned her to expect EVERY TIME SHE IS UPSET mummy and daddy drop EVERYTHING to comfort her, that's just poor parenting. At 6, she should be self-soothing. You need a new therapist, yesterday! 

I am so upset for your eldest daughter. You have done her a serious injustice and it's obvious you favor your younger daughter over her. You are being unfair, and you don't even recognize it. Get your younger daughter an assessment, and a new therapist. 

Apologize to your eldest daughter. Do better."
e383uh,"YTA.  

> fiancée is upset because I proposed in public, even though a couple months back she mentioned how that would give her pressure & anxiety.

Like.. duh."
e3869q,YTA.   Your grandma and aunt are only looking out for your best interests.   Not sure why that offends you.   Sounds like you need someone to be looking out since your mom isn’t holding you accountable for your success in school.
e3879h,NAH. You’re broken up - you are no longer obligated to communicate with him for any reason.

e38t9u,"NTA, if your mom isn’t capable of watching him by herself, HIS mom needs to take responsibility of her own offspring.   Also., They are the assholes for trying to make your dad stay home with him."
e38wwk,"NTA, your partner’s family shouldn’t be treating you like that, and it’s completely reasonable to not want to visit with people that make “jokes” at your expense and treat you like shit for being better educated than them."

You are not ""technically the reason"" for his speeding. He made the choice to take you to the airport, show up late, and speed. 

He's the a-hole for expecting that you would pay his ticket though."
e39enu,"ESH. While he was wrong for saying all those things, if your brother was truly one of your closest friends you shouldnt have gave him shit over a pack of gum and some snacks. Me and my siblings never act like this"
e39inp,"Giving them money won’t do anything, they’ve proven to have very poor money management skills. The fact that they’re staying in a motel instead of renting a small apartment (which would be a ton cheaper) is a huge red flag.

1) you sounds super dismissive of your wife, like you think she’s stupid and you’re high and mighty. you want to get rid of the help so “she’ll do something” but you shouldn’t be delegating, you’re not in charge of her.

2) if she is not contributing, you have every right to be frustrated, and things need to change. she’s being lazy and you are totally justified in what you expect from her.

e3apzb,"NTA. It sounds like this woman has made little to no effort to develop a relationship with you, so why would you feel a familial connection with her? I think you should talk to your dad and tell him how you feel--that your stepmom doesn't seem to have mad much of an effort to actually connect with you other than yelling or getting mad, and it's made you feel conflicted. Even say you would be open to more of a relationship with her (if you are), but if this woman has lived with you for FIVE years and made this little effort, it doesn't sound like she really cares. But people can always change. Also, I do think it's reasonable to tell your dad that it makes you very uncomfortable to be in the same room as your stepmom while she dances, and say you'd prefer to leave the room if she ever engages in that.

Something like buying tickets to a show you know they want to see and offering to go together? Or those cheesy fake coupons for babysitting or a day trip to the beach? Might need to brainstorm on that a bit, but I think it'd go a long way to try to replace ""gifting"" with some other thoughtful gesture so they know it's not a matter of you being lazy or not caring."

Instead of framing it as better for both of you, have an honest conversation about your own feelings.  And give her an opportunity to tell you how she feels.

Secondly, you've made your daughter's tuition dependant on C accepting her apology. As the fees are something between you and your daughter that's not appropriate especially as C seems to be the issue here.

Your niece is very aware of her loss. Her classmates have parents, but she doesn’t. She made herself vulnerable and asked to call you Mom. It would be a gift, not only to her, but to the memory of your sister. You can’t replace her, obviously, but you can take up the helm of raising her daughter like she would have.

In the three times it took you to say “watch the tea” louder and louder, you could have walked over and moved your child away.

Just because they’re family does NOT mean you have to be kind if they’re not extending the same courtesy. I can’t imagine that shunning is doing wonders for your mental health either, and it’s in no way your responsibility to gift them anything. 

If you want to try and keep in friendly contact with the kids, I understand wanting to buy them presents, but you’re also saving up to start a family (congrats by the way!) which is much more important IMO. You can always try to explain the situation to the kids when they’re older if you want a relationship with them, but unfortunately I don’t see your brother changing anytime soon and wouldn’t waste another dollar on him. It may be a little awkward if you come around with no gifts, but it’s awkward your brother put you in this position in the first place. 

So in conclusion, you wouldn’t be the asshole if you didn’t buy them gifts, but if it makes you feel better you can. I hope the situation gets better and have a great Christmas regardless.

e3m6g1,"NTA and I’m appalled by the amount of “don’t snitch” in this comments section 

Downvote me to hell, but smoking is an awful habit. It destroys your body and causes all kinds if health issues, plus it’s nasty. Cigarette butts are the most littered item in the world, ash trays stink, it makes your breath nasty, and second hand smoke is carcinogenic (it causes cancer). Furthermore, as a teenager, your brother is also stunting his growth and doing damage to his brain. He’s hurting himself. If he continues to smoke and picks up this habit, he cuts years off of his life and does quite a bit of damage to others because of secondhand smoke. Nicotine also does a pretty substantial amount of damage to developing brains. 

And that’s not mentioning that he lied to you, and broke the deal you had arranged. If he cannot meet the terms of his deal, then said deal shouldn’t be fulfilled. He smoked. That’s his fault and you’re NTA at all if you tell. You even gave him a 2nd chance. 

It’s good for your brother because it might make him stop and it illustrates that actions have consequences. 

But, seeing as I’ve got a brother, it feels obligatory to say you need to sit him down and have a real heart to heart about how nasty that stuff is and how badly it’s hurting him. Make it very clear he does not get another chance. Put the ball in his court and see if he fouls again. Not quite as extreme as telling on him and might accomplish everything without the blow up. 

Best of luck."

Nothing wrong here at all. He's being open and honest about his feelings.

>So I told him to stay in his lane.

Your boyfriend (1) expressed how he feels about this, open and honestly, and (2) acknowledged he cannot and should not tell you what to do in spite of his discomfort.

asking once is fine. but when you’re told the restaurant’s rules you should know that you’re putting your server in a very uncomfortable position by asking them to beg their bosses to break the established rules"
e3ogyf,"Nah, YTA the whole story is phony. 

1. Costco membership cards don’t have two names on them. Memberships can have two members but each member gets their own card with name and photo. You are not allowed to use someone else’s card. There are also age requirements to be a Costco member and if you want to be a membership co-signer you have to have the same street address of the main cardholder. So they came in with their dad’s membership card and no personal ID. Cashier did their job and nothing more.

2. When asked “why didn’t you talk to a manager” The OP said “there was no time to talk to the manager  between arguing with the cashier and getting kicked out by security.”  But then also says “mom was paying cash had no id or drivers license.” and “the cashier just ignored us.” So it wasn’t an argument, more like the two were just yelling at the cashier for doing their job because they had no valid id. And instead of talking to a manager, which would’ve been pointless since they have no id, they chose to sit there and yell at the cashier, who didn’t even engage them, until security came and took them outside.

The story changes from the cashier being abusive to the mom and the son yelling at the cashier for doing their job. If the mom had Id she could’ve gone to member services and gotten another membership card printed up. She shouldve gone home and gotten her ID.

The lesson here is that it takes a lot for fucking Costco security to throw you out. You have to do something to earn that kind of treatment."

Their bodies won’t process the water like that. They’ll need to pee around midnight from the water you have them a few hours before bed. You’re better off if you cut off water several hours BEFORE bed because they won’t have any waste to build up. If they sleep at eight, last cup of water should be at 5 with last chance to pee right before bed. Otherwise they’ll pee. But why are you letting them sleep in your bed if this is such an issue for you? Either they wear pull ups or they don’t sleep in your bed until they can sleep the night through without an accident. 

You let them push you around until you snapped. That’s on you and your lack of boundaries. The minute they started playing with the water, you should have taken it away. Same with the gummies. You let them make you angry until you snap, and because they know you won’t do anything they keep acting like that. You are, right now, the kind of person who would raise an awful terror of a child. Of course they don’t respect someone who lets them do whatever they want."

e3sw8n,NTA. You’re an adult and your first priority needs to be your partner and your son. You don’t have to feel guilty not extending an invitation to your home to someone who treats you all poorly. At some point there needs to be a conversation that you will no longer put up with his treatment of your partner.
e3sxtc,NTA. Your ex needs to be held accountable for paying child support for his child. Do what you need to do to ensure you get the money. He knows he owes it and is purposely screwing around to keep it from you.
e3t93k,"NAH. I think a lot of people are going to call you the asshole for calling him stupid. That wasn’t great and I think you know that. But I don’t think that tips you into asshole territory, I think it makes you human. I get that you feel frustrated because you think he should fight and that there is something worth fighting for, but if he is also dealing with depression he just might not have it in him. 

I deal with both chronic pain and major depression and I just don’t have the words to describe to someone who hasn’t had the experience the grinding ordeal that the day to day becomes. You are just so fucking tired and fucking *bored* by your own pain. I can completely understand how he could want to usher in a resolution to his glaucoma, just to be done with it.

 I know this isn’t what you want for him and I don’t blame you for feeling hurt. But he’s fucking tired and it’s his choice to make. You need to let him make it. There’s a peace that comes with accepting your fate. I’d advise you to look for that."

Snitching on him for having his phone out. Some might say that's a bit too far but honestly I would have done the same.

And then his friends yelled at you and stamped on your bag AND emptied it out? Yikes what the fuck, that isn't okay.

What you said was a bit extreme and there was no need to bring his weight into it, but considering their actions, I would say it's totally justified."

e3uaem,"NTA because I honestly do not understand why she would cry over you asking a pretty normal question.

e3vevj,NTA. You absolutely did the right thing. Some dogs just aren't meant to be around other animals or children and it sounds like Coco was one of them. There's nothing you can do about that but accept it. The breeder should have warned you about the possible temperament issues. I urge you to report them. Thank you for thinking of your sweet older dog and his comfort first. You sound like a wonderful pet owner who just got saddled with an animal they couldn't control.

e3viht,"Dude, more than just the Christmas tree, I am REALLY concerned about your budget here. How far above your means are you living that you make 150 THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR, and you can’t afford a $95 Christmas tree? You already have a tree and I think it was shitty your wife tried to guilt you by talking to your kid about it, so NTA there, but how are you referring to yourself as a “deadbeat” whose $5,000 vacation wiped them out, when you are making THAT MUCH MONEY. That is absolutely insane and I really think there’s a lot going on here besides just a tree."
e3vkd2,"NTA. This is really cold, but why would she think ""Her own family"" is the children of the woman who her husband was married to when she met him? Aka her husband's family who she never raised or much interacted with? 

Abandonment by definition requires an initial presence (you can't abandon someone you never knew). NTA. Unfortunate, but your father and his wife are the aholes here. 

Your father was wrong to tell his daughter you were coming to visit and never once ask you to come until it was almost too late."

03:00am is a pretty shitty time to be 'whispering' in the living room, that noise can carry through a quiet house and be very annoying.

He shouldn't be acting like a child and blame and guilt trip you for an argument he had with his wife, that's just pretty low,"
e3vty3,"NTA. I do it to my b/f all the time, as he will often do with me. Neither of us take offense at all. Sounds like he had issues with it because he felt like it was challenging him. Glad he’s your ex now, sounds like a jerk."
e3vusb,"NTA obvious favouritism if you ask me. Your stepfather left a note for you so therefore, it should he yours. Simple as that. Aldo, about the part about you stealing the name, your son was born 3 months ago, she was pregnant after that. You didn't steal the name."
e3vv09,"NTA, you warned them many times and they refuse to listen AND they dumped work on you def not the a-hole"
e3w2is,"NTA

She has the etiquette backwards. The person familiar with the group has the responsibility of introductions and staying close to the partner. 

Moreover, they also have the duty of providing the time limit to be spent. 

While you should check in equally from time to time, it’s not very much obligated. 

Also, it sounds like the minor “celebrities” are jealous that she has an independent partner. 

Sounds like she cares too much about outside opinions. And if she spent the entire time talking about you behind your back, then she doesn’t respect you."
e3w437,"NTA for storming out. You should have gotten the heads up. However, will you still get a good reference from him? Doubtful. He was most likely worried that you would take intellectual property with you and he wanted to protect that, but he went about it in a really shitty way."
e3wbqw,"NTA because damn. 'You could've done it just to be nice' sounds like guilt tripping, and he admitted it himself that it wasn't much so why make such a big deal out of it?

Communication is always a difficult thing to get right because people understand and react differently to everything. But if you apologised for how you phrased it and tried to explain yourself properly, and he was still fairly aggressive about the situation (which was a few unwashed dishes; why such a big response?) then he is the one with an issue here.

It's one of those situations where it may be just a small thing, but it's all about the lack of respect for you. Not massive disrespect, but the fact he's getting upset to that point, even after you tried making amends, just feels disproportionate.

I also get he was getting up super early to leave, but getting that mad about it just feels mean. All that was needed was a 'sorry, I thought you could do them in the morning because I needed to sleep' or something. It feels like immense guilt tripping.

I hope you feel better, and that the two of you can sort everything out."
e3wftk,NTA. you were upfront with her after you discovered her lie. she is definitely TA here.

e3wx1f,NTA she could be in serious physical trouble and needs to see a doctor.
e3xady,"NAH. This just seems like a normal chink in an otherwise good friendship. It seems to me that your friend might not understand that you are being truthful when you tell him you can’t hang out for the reasons you give. He probably thinks that you are giving excuses. But you have the right to say no to something if you don’t want to or if you can’t. 
I would try to talk it out next time you see one another in person. Explain to him that you aren’t lying and that you value his friendship, and he will eventually come around."
e3xbku,"YTA.

>The issue is that I see my child once a week now. We are close but I can tell he doesn’t really need me.

Do you really believe that? I know children in this situation, and they never stop wishing their parents would love them more. By the time your child is old enough to ""come live with you if he chooses,"" he'll choose not to, because he'll have worked out that he was never a priority for you.

If you want to improve your life, do it, but don't do it overseas."
e3xfd4,"NTA. It’s fine that he wants to hang with his friends and he should be allowed to do that, but leaving you alone for so long when you’re uncomfortable isn’t right. He can balance the two, spend some time with pals and some time with you. 

I feel like it’s just a case of men being emotionally unavailable, rather than him necessarily being an asshole. As your partner he should consider your feelings and wellbeing"
e3xi4i,"If your girlfriend's sweat is staining the sheets that badly after walking home from work, she needs a doctor not a shower."
e3xr7j,NTA you are not obligated to give people free rides...especially when they’re being assholes
e3xsd3,NTA. Find better friends. These people are rubbish.
e3xsu6,"So, I can see where you were coming from with this. 

Here’s my issue with execution, though. 

By your own admission, your employees got their asses kicked. 

When you told your employees what was happening and why, I doubt that they were feeling enlightened, educated, or more open minded. Most likely they were feeling resentful. Towards you, and towards the people they were already discriminating against. 

Under the assumption you weren’t just doing it to make them suffer something they’d only view as a punishment, and honestly wanted them to interface better with customers, NTA. I just think there could have been a better way to go around it. Like you said, they’re still pissed a week later."
e3xu1b,"It’s his xbox, you don’t have a right to it. YTA. Now maybe if you were gonna ask him nicely, maybe even offer to do something for him, he would give you the pin no problem. However allowing your parents to punish your brother for not giving the pin means he’s not gonna want to let you play at all. You don’t respect your brother or his property clearly."
e3xxti,"NTA, he's the parent and you're the child (albeit an older teen), he ought to be taking the initiative to make the plan."
e3y081,"Dude, she probably is having a PTSD-like response to this pregnancy  from her past experiences with two miscarriages. Her response to the trip isnt a matter of rationality or logic. She's scared.

You accept that shit wholeheartedly, and even play that CD on blast on the home stereo system. You are grateful that she tried. You shut up, sell the PSU, pony up the difference for the one you want, and get on with your life. 

Don’t fuck with Grandma."
e3ybu9,NTA. How old is she?
e3yg19,"NTA. He didn't put much effort into raising you without bullying, and you're still trying to keep the peace by getting him a gift. You don't have anything to worry about."
e3yild,NTA you have every right to be uncomfortable about this. Just be calm when you approach this as it seems as though she doesn’t have many friends.
e3ylre,This isn't really a matter for AITA. This is deep deep territory that you need to be discussing with a therapist or a priest or a family psych.
e3ypz5,"NAH Although as a general rule it is to be assumed 230am is much too late to be texting anyone but as you say you 'saw' him online it is not entirely your fault.

Hes not wrong for being upset with you waking him and now has made it clear he doesnt want texts that late."
e3yr5z,"ESH. You don’t buy something for one child and nothing for the other, but you need to realize PDQ that your kid isn’t better than your nephew. She may be smart, but if she’s being mean and nasty and calling names, you certainly haven’t taught her to be kind."
e3yssy,"NTA

Thought this was you proposing right before he did.

If all she was yapping about was how you showed him all the options, then she must be real insecure. All you did was help a friend and even told him to ask his GF on stuff, but he refused cause he wanted the surprise factor.

She is probably salty you are closer to him than she is or something."
e3z6jm,"ESH

Unless you actually know that she is disruptive or doesn't pay attention you don't really have a right to judge her. Everyone learns in different ways and different teachers will inspire students differently. She can absolutely have the opinion that the teachers aren't very good if they are failing to engage her or take her needs as a student into account.

The appropriate response to make would have been ""oh you didn't like them? I've had them both and found them to be very good teachers""

She also sounds like she was being narrow-minded and judgemental. Texting you later and telling you that you need to rethink what you said seems petty."
e3zjd6,"NTA in fact, I'm surprised you didnt take everything out of your name.

If you havent done that with the utilities yet, I highly suggest you do that immediately.  If you don't live there then NOTHING in that place should be in your name now."
e3zl7a,"NAH, assuming your mom is looking out for your best interests and isn't just complaining about the hour. That said, I'd suggest carefully examining your outings and ensuring that they aren't affecting your grades, your health, etc, and that you aren't doing anything that'd get you in legal trouble."

If your parents want a big wedding, let them throw one for themselves."
e3zvxe,NTA. I do think you should have made it clear what you were taking so they had a chance to replace it but threatening you is way over the top.
e4029t,"NTA

But it depends on how you are 'correcting' their mistakes. If you're just pointing out every time they are wrong and being overly critical, that's kind of assholish, but if you're being helpful and showing them better ways to do it, and of course also making sure to explain to them why you are doing it, then you're not TA."
e404p5,"NTA. Your money, your decision. That said, I'd suggest a long talk with grandma and grandpa to make sure it's what they truly want, make sure it won't leave you destitute, and make sure they'll be cared for back in Vietnam."
e40bu1,ESH she should be more mindful and respectful of time.  You sound overbearing and patronizing.
e40iet,"Eh, close call, but I'll go with YTA. Your house, your rules, but it sounds like it wasn't your house. Thus, while it may have been more respectful to avoid the topic, it sounds like you threw a tantrum because the others disagreed with your positions."
e40r82,i don't think she's planning on getting the abortion dude
e40sw2,"YTA. It would have also been inconsiderate to ignore the phone. When you’re traveling with other people, sometimes you have to be inconvenienced. Making plans for the morning was important. If you didn’t want to do that, you should have made plans last night and let everyone know you were sleeping in"
e40xng,"NTA, just be sure you don't fall afoul of squatters rights where you live"
e416cd,"NTA. Your husband is purposefully doing his chores badly trying to get you so exhausted with him that you'll do them yourself. He also sounds very abusive with his words, which I am very sorry about. Is this a man you want to keep? Appreciation for what, exactly? Berating you?"
e41fyw,"NTA. The system was a gift of yours. You were kind enough to let your siblings use it. Your sister abused that by taking your game system to college without permission, and she has no right to get pissy about you putting your foot down and not allowing that to happen again."
e41j8k,YTA if you hide them and disrespect her wishes.  Talk to her and explain the situation and that you will be more careful than the previous tenant.
e41jv5,"YTA because you promised your friend a ride and aren’t coming through. I understand not wanting to upset your mom, but still, leaving your friend with no ride is shitty."
e41lb8,NTA. You are not required to be tolerant of intolerance. If your sister's orientation is that offensive to him that he can't put it aside for an evening with his family then he *should* stay away.
e41mcv,"Mate, you've been in seven car accidents and are still recovering from the last one... and your husband *still* doesn't realize that your anxiety isn't a commentary on his driving skills? NTA but maybe get couples therapy if you aren't already. This kind of thing would mess anyone up, and if the therapist can get your husband to realize that this is not and never has been about him, all the better."
e41n1u,"NAH. Tell him. Writing is hard, but you're right, you don't get anything if you don't try."
e41wqa,"NTA, any boss who expects someone to be happy 100% of the time while doing their job is unrealistic."
e422z3,"ESH... Unnecessary drama from all of you. You made a wrong assumption between you, you could have knocked gently on the door or something to see if she was up... Your sister was annoyed, and overreacted a bit for sure, thinking there was more to the situation than there is... But your rant at the end shows you to be anything but nonchalant when it comes to your sister, and is also a massive overreaction.

I assume there's a lot of history to this though, in wider terms I don't know who the asshole is, as there's definitely difficulties in your relationship with your sister... But in isolation, in the end it's just breakfast, and you and your sister are both making a massive deal out of it."
e42eqw,"NTA- I’ll never get why people say the opposite for these posts. I would want to know if it were me. If I were you, I would cut him out of my life for good though."
e42h6b,"YTA

That sounds frustrating. My husband is always whining when I lose stuff, but he loses things, too. I am sure you lose things every once in a while. So the language that is ""has"" to be her is wrong. It's *probably* her, or *most likely* her, but saying it is 100% her and you never misplace anything IS ABSURD. I am sure you make mistakes, too.

She should be more considerate of your things, but come on, it took you a minute to find your nail clippers? And you ""have to call her phone?"" Come on. That's your wife. Be nice."
e42jt9,NTA. I think family & business doesn’t work. I would just get up that share of the rent & move on from this situation because it’s not working out as it should.
e42t3x,"NTA your dad says he doesn't care, so you shouldn't. If he manages to fall asleep in each movie I can't believe that he's too invested. He likely just comes along to keep you company.

Don't listen to these strangers, both your parents were chill about you giving up the ticket for your friend."
e42vdk,"YTA.

Your brother told you that you pout when you don't get your way. Now you are on Reddit literally pouting. He went to your parents for support and you are mad they ""talked behind your back."" He is just trying to communicate his feelings in a delicate way. The original argument is pretty silly - he was trying to share something he loves (music) with you, and you got mad because it wasn't what you wanted. Half the music you want and half the music he wants sounds very reasonable.

ETA. You already have three specific examples. 1) the incident with your mom jabbing 2) the music 3) pouting on Reddit now."
e42ykn,"NTA

HIS family expects cards? Great, he can send them."
e435nq,Where is the interpersonal conflict?
e4383l,"NAH. She was trying to lighten the mood. She sounds like a caring woman, and you are obviously on edge. 

Let it go. Take some comfort from your wife. Life will go on. 

So sorry for your loss."
e438ni,"NTA, the ""blood is thicker than water"" excuse is bullshit. You shouldn't have to deal with a toxic person just because you're related. SIL sounds like a pathological liar. How does your wife feel about this though? Is she supportive of your decision to not associate with her sister?"
e43940,"NTA - maybe there is a self esteem thing there as you probably know but no, that doesn’t make you an asshole.  But...why the heck did your friend react like that and tell people who are now mad at you for it?  That’s an ahole move!"
e43cs8,"NTA: friends should be able to reality-check each other. I’d maybe ease it in a little though. Ask her to be realistic— when was her last modeling gig? Maybe even spin it such that having a higher paying job might actually afford her a couple of sessions with high profile photographers and give her room to invest/work her way out of Instagram-basic? 

She’s eventually gotta realize that pretty doesn’t last forever. But all you can do is lead her to it, and the kick in the ass has to come from her. If not, it’ll come from some other extreme outside force and it’s is going to suck even more."
e43dqt,"3 adults and none of you gets more food? 

ESH. But the little sister."
e43exa,"NTA - I wouldn't order the ""sad"" burger either."

e43i77,"YTA if you expect her to carry another kid when she’s like 50. But otherwise, no, I don’t think so. It’s normal to miss children and miss when they’re young. They’re so sweet, and innocent.

e44smw,"So... heres the fun news about in-kind donations.

Here's how it goes.

1. I donate a sofa to goodwill.
2. Goodwill gives me a receipt. It says: thanks for donating a sofa.
3. I forego the standard deduction on my taxes. I catalog my in-kind donation, using receipts. None of the receipts I have for in-kind donations will have a valuation on it (they used to but not any more). When I catalog my in-kinds for tax purpose, \*I\* am responsible for providing a valuation of the donation. (See #3 in the section about what a donation receipt is required to have:  [https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/create-a-501c3-tax-compliant-donation-receipt/](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/create-a-501c3-tax-compliant-donation-receipt/) ). 
4. Lets say I get audited as a result. I will have to have photos to prove the valuation I ascribed to my in-kind donations.

All that to say, its really not JUST a matter of getting a receipt. If your aunt wants the tax savings, she needs to do the work.

e44u42,"NTA You were clear and honest with her and she ignored you, that's something she needs to work on, not your fault. Honestly gifts should be something you give because you want to and can, not because you feel obligated or because you expect something in return. Also the fact that she keeps bragging about how much money she spent on your gift is really distasteful and of putting. It's pretty weird."
e44x86,"NTA. Also if I were to do it on FB, I’d post something on HIS profile not her photo. She just wants likes and comments..."
e44ycu,"NTA. you had absolutely no relationship
with this man and your step siblings even said you didnt have to be there. im sorry they didnt wish you a happy birthday, but i think you’re reading too much into that, they probably have bigger things on their mind."
e453ai,"Hugs help when the person hugging you respects your boundaries. If they don't respect them, then yell at you while showing you a bs article they certainly don't. They should add that disclaimer lol.
Jokes aside, NTA"
e454o1,"Yeah, no harm in setting up some boundaries to make a toxic relationship less toxic. Congrats on coming out.

NTA"
e455fi,NAH imo. It was a surprise gift I'm assuming and you didn't expect it. He was being nice and trying to help you but a phone is something you'll have for a few years before you get a new one so you should be happy with it. I think you should thank him for it but explain why it isn't practical for you
e45c3y,"If you don't want to hear people, you need to move. 
If the noise is bothering you, but even you admit it isn't excessive, then maybe YOU need to look at soundproofing solutions. 

Sometimes, it's not the other party that's the problem, and here it sounds like they are simply living there, which you can't fault them for."
e45csv,"NTA - it sounds like Joe wanted you there but only if it was convenient for him. You had planned on him picking you up, he bails because he doesn’t want to deal with traffic. I am assuming like any other mode of public transportation it would be money out of your pocket for something you weren’t all to invested in."
e45fam,"NTA as I bet they are aware it’s your space and that it’s residential parking.

However, it’s asking for trouble and I would’ve just let it go for tonight and I think your BF is being petty and causing trouble for the mistake he’s made, so he’s probably TA here too."
e45gsg,NTA. He knows you'll clean up after messes he makes *while he makes them*. Don't let him piss on your leg and tell you it's raining.
e45gu2,"NTA. It’s yours to send wherever you want, whenever you want, for any reason you want. Middle bro sounds entitled and like his priorities are outta whack."
e45h7r,NTA to meter your own emotional output. Sometimes things are just above your paygrade.
e45hlo,"NAH - I’m sure your boyfriend is upset that he let you down. But shit like anxiety doesn’t really care about other people’s feelings. Anxiety is one of those things where it can physically make you sick and I am sure that’s why he wanted you to take him back home. 

And while it sucks that he couldn’t make it, this is a thing that he needs to work on and get help for.

Talk to him. Maybe even make dinner together at his house. Have a nice relaxing evening."
e45i8x,No one is ever an asshole “in a good way”.  Your SO sounds toxic and you should slowly remove yourself from him.
e45j6m,"NTA

As far as I can tell (not knowing typical US semester dates) you gave them about 9 months notice of your intention to move? That is plenty of time for them to make alternative arrangements. And by the sounds of it your continued living situation was just assumed on their part, rather than based on actual discussions, so it isn't even like you went back on your word. *And* you've said you'll help find them a new person. You're fine mate."
e45m1g,She probably wakes you up doing all the stuff moms do to make children like you comfortable. YTA and a brat for even thinking this makes good sense.
e45n12,"YTA if you go see your grandparents at all. They sound awful and like they are emotionally abusing your aunt with cancer. Even if it's a religious thing, they're still giant assholes and so are people who hand wave or excuse that behavior."
e45orh,NTA. It was your food. She should’ve asked.
e45qax,I think YTA for not taking your husbands feelings into consideration. You both created this child and so he should have a say in what the name should be and you guys could come to a compromise.
e45r92,NTA — not your responsibility. You offered him help and it wasn’t what he wanted. He has no right to be pissy with you. You didn’t have to answer his phone call at all on Thanksgiving. You could’ve had it off the whole day to spend with family.
e45rq4,"YTA, she can't make everyone a bridesmaid. Be thankful you don't have to spend time or money on it."
e45ug9,Info - if you knew going into it they'd be gone through the end of December why won't you leave now?
e45w39,"NTA. Fuck that guy. Save those kids.

Do be careful though, this woman might harbor ill will towards your mother, and she might act on it, and you will be the one who gave her the information."
e45x75,"NTA. You have every right to choose your own makeup, and it was bizarre and controlling of your mom to try to take that control away from you in such a public confrontation. Is your mom this overbearing in other ways too?"
e45xpz,"YTA.

>He told me that it wasn’t really my place to say, and that he was bisexual and not gay. I kinda shrugged and told him that they were basically the same and he got upset and told me that he was going to bed.

This is the thing. It's not your place to say. You're making decisions for him and that makes you TA."
e45z1k,""" I didn’t go because I wasn’t personally asked to come ""

I was going to say N-A-H, but after this ""clarification"" from you, YTA.  You knew you were invited, but because someone didn't beg you to come, you decided to make a statement and not come. Who knows, maybe more ""friends"" will just decide to do the same thing as they see you being an ass about it. 

It would be different if you HONESTLY did not think you were invited.

I am guessing there were other friends that showed up to the party without a formal invitation either."
e462ep,"NTA, at all. Your current husband needs to work on himself, because that’s a pretty gross thing to make you feel guilty about. It’s not like you’re harbouring feelings for an ex; he died. You’re allowed to miss him and grieve him and want to remember him. 

That said, approach current hubs with love. Try to understand his feelings and let him know you care about him, but you don’t feel comfortable hiding your late husband or his life. Conflict resolution should be about finding a true solution, not winning a fight. Good luck!"
e464nr,NTA- tell them now before this becomes a habit.
e469ns,"For the record, NTA and I think everyone calling you petty is being absurd. Your ex puts in no effort during the year but wants you to just hand over your son on Christmas? Parenting is all the shit that happens between New Year's and Xmas....

That being said, your son is old enough to make the decision and if you discuss it with him without making him feel guilty or like he's the bad guy, I think no matter his decision it would be a win for you."
e46fdg,NAH - You stopped when you realized you were being creepy
e46kz5,The freemasons....run girl....run.
e46m4y,"NTA - But it seems like maybe it could've been handled better. It's okay to want some things to be just for you, and it's also okay to want your boyfriend to respect that.

The 5 year old is just the same, but they're still learning so it's something that has to be taught, just like all manners"
e46q88,"When I opened this, I thought it was going to be a picture of *you* and him, and I was like, yeah, he should probably change that, it's telling people you're still together. But your dog? I mean. I don't know if it makes you an asshole or not, but it does seem pretty childish.

I'd say yeah, YTA. You weren't just to ask, that's fine, but he said no, with good reason, and to keep pushing himself about it, yeah. Just move on."
e46x7k,Tell them together?
e477i2,What about an ultimatum? You will remove her from the class u less mom agrees to stay in another room.
e47ig3,Is this a real post?  Over 55 cents? YTA for this post.
e47ilw,"NTA though in the future, it would probably be more fair to remind the kids who aren’t doing the work they agreed to do that they aren’t meeting expectations and if they don’t pick it up, they won’t be getting paid."
e47mll,Yta. Why does it matter and why did you feel the need to point it out not having ever met the kid?
e47n3o,"NTA for merely asking, but YWBTA for demanding it. You have no jurisdiction over who your mutual friends associate."
e47xe9,"NTA, they're keeping the deposit, your paths have diverged, it is what it is"
e47xr5,"NTA

You barely get any PTO in the whole year and their expectations are not reasonable."
e4803u,"ESH. Shoplifters obviously suck, but you did behave unprofessionally and deserved to be reprimanded at the very least."
e4817e,NTA. I’m sorry this happened to you. You deserve friends who will be honest with you and he refuses to do that.
e482ug,"YTA

You were sneaking around their home while everyone else was together and expecting you to be there. This is a huge violation of social norms and you are the asshole for that.

If you don't agree with the social norms, don't participate. I'm with you on gift opening. But please - don't act like opening gifts is so morally repugnant that you physically cannot be in the same room and needed to go somewhere else. In someone else's home. Without asking them. It's just not respectful and it's really weird behaviour."
e4840y,"NTA. Your friend is taking advantage at this point. Your mom wants him out, it’s your job to tell him that."

e485wq,"NTA. This roommate is a gigantic asshole. If you’re paying rent, you get access to common spaces whenever you want - not when the guy sleeping on the couch allows it."
e488on,NTA - - Your friend is the asshole for telling her about your conversation with him. He should have done this on his own without you telling him. I hope your sister eventually realizes you did this because you love her.
e489s6,"I see no harm in bringing them, but I would ask the friend first if they mind if you knitted during the hangout.  NAH, necessarily."
e489yn,"NTA.  Sounds like your mom is toxic and you avoiding her is best for you.  All OK NTA for exploding, people can only take so much constant criticism."
e48aem,NTA. Every kid needs an adult in their life that they can go to with things like this. It’s awesome that your nephew has you to fill that role.
e48ez2,"NTA - but don't hold it against the cousin.

Talk to your parents about requesting your aunt repay for the damaged brushes and wasted paint."
e48gev,"NTA, but the best course is to leave her alone. I understand the hurt that can come from thinking someone was a good friend, only to find out that they didn't care about you as much as you do them. Also, establishing boundaries (which it sounds like you were doing by being more assertive) tends to weed out people who don't respect your boundaries. It hurts like hell, but overall you're better in the long run to not have people like this in your life.

Edit: I misread and thought it was HER wedding at first. It's understandable that you might not be invited to her sister's wedding, even if she wanted to invite you. With the per person costs, wedding lists can get cut throat, so I wouldn't hold it against your friend that you weren't invited. The fact that she said ""leave me alone "" still makes me think that you should, in fact, leave her alone. But if you are missing her and your friendship still after a few weeks or months, I think it would be acceptable to check back in with her."
e48lj9,"NTA you’re not stopping him from chasing his goals, you’re just not willing to give up your own, which is totally fair! A steady job, a car, and a degree are all very important and realistic things to want for yourself. Don’t let him bully you into leaving"
e48max,"NTA Everyone expressed interest in the meat-related pizzas and ""agreed"" to the cheese ones. Then they ate the only pizza you could eat and did not apologize for not leaving you a slice. If they want cheese pizza, they should order cheese pizza."
e48mq8,"NTA. You have an obligation to tell your friend things like this - you have no obligation to this acquaintance. If you don’t want people finding out you’ve done shady shit, don’t do shady shit."
e48nf3,NAH. Part of being a parent is teaching kids the tough lessons they need to know in order to relate to others and be kind. You did the right thing.
e48nhz,NTA. That’s gross. I hope he was at least sleeping on a sheet on the couch.
e48oe3,"YWBTA. If she's as bad as you describe, she will take any humiliation you put on her, multiply it by 100, and inflict it on your brother as revenge. 

PS, this is a good example of why ""I don't sugarcoat things, I tell it like it is"" people are like 2-year-olds in their ethical and emotional intelligence. Good for you for asking for advice though."
e48p9m,"oooooh lady I was on your side until you started using sex as leverage. Use your words and work through the issue; don’t punish people for not giving in to what you want. 

ESH."
e48qr8,NTA. There’s no point in her spending a ton of money on furniture that you don’t like and will most likely end up putting on Craigslist or donating
e48vq1,"Rule8. A Gala, really a Gala that he ""had to go"", really ? And a hat for graduation how old is he, maybe your shitpost should say prom."
e490vl,"NAH - this is pretty par for the course given the boundaries you agreed to. If you don’t like it, you need to say something"
e491wd,NTA. Don’t light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. Never let anyone make you feel guilty for prioritizing your own well being and eliminating the toxic from your life.
e493nx,NTA.  Your wife is an enabler and her brother desperately needs to learn how to be an adult with adult responsibilities.  Sometimes that means being forced to figure things out the hard way.
e494tc,YTA. It’s not yours until you pay for it. As a cashier I’ve seen things go wrong with credit cards and cash registers. What happens if something gets screwed up and you can’t pay for it? You’ve just stolen that item. And you’re teaching your kids to do the same. As a mom I always had snacks in my bag.  Let your kids eat/drink things you’ve already bought.
e49aiw,[removed]
e49b4y,NTA. No need to attend and be uncomfortable in the presence of people who don't even like you or want you there. You can always visit your bio mom at her grave if you want.
e49c0g,Ehh NAH.  She was doing it by accident obviously.  She can’t control what she does while asleep.  But at the same time I don’t blame you for doing what you can to mitigate her uncontrollable response.
e49wxi,"**You are NTA.** It should have been the guy's responsibility to ask you questions about the behavior of the cats before adopting them from you. It is also not your responsibility to take the cats from these owners as you have signed off your ownership of them. These man and woman are also both wrong for suggesting to put down healthy cats. I don't know what country you are in but in the U.S., animal abuse is against the law and punishable for jail time and heavy fines."
e49ybl,"YTA. Your uncle gave you a job and hired your friends I assume based off of your recommendation. When you left for another job and took them with, you were leaving him SOL. He tried to be civil to you, for the sake of your relationship. Quitting left him in even worse shape because he was hugely understaffed and had no one to train the two new hires. He’s your family and he did right by you by hiring you all in the first place, the least you could have done was leave at your notice date."
e49yif,NTA. That flatmate is a total dick though. Also...u might want to keep an eye on him around ur gf. That whole scene was dodgy asf.
e4a3al,ABSOLUTELY NTA - And here’s why. I hear it a lot especially on my small inbred city. I’m constantly asked to move for families though my SO and are childless and intend to stay that way. The way I see it is that their poor planning is not my issue. Period. But families constantly run late and expect others to accommodate them. Nah. Not happening.
e4aa3y,"NTA. I feel you should wear what makes you comfortable, irrespective of the event."
e4abf5,"ESH and NAH

You got rid of something he cared about because it was creepy to you 

He kept a dead fucking lizard corpse for four years."

e4aucc,"I mean you sure sound like YTA. She’s seven. Take a bite, say something dumb like “yum, i’m full right now but this is amazing!” and send her on her way. Not hard."
e4axj0,"Your absence isn’t causing them pain, it is causing them GUILT, which is completely deserved it sounds like. And it isn’t your job to fix their guilt."
e4b91f,"NAH and I think it's a lovely idea. It's called a ""plus one"" because it's you plus one person of your choosing. I think especially since your friends know and like your mom it's completely fine. If you're worried whether it might be a problem for your friends (I doubt it or they'd have let you know in the invitation) you can just ask them, but really I think it should be fine. It's not like she's a random acquaintance or something. It really should be all good. I hope you and your mom have fun!"
e4bf5a,"NTA: This just makes me sad, and I would consider dropping these “friends” over this. 

Have they done anything like this to you before? Did anything happen during the planning process that would have inclined them to blow you off?"
e4bhlg,"You are N T A for buying a more expensive gift for your bf than his family members. BUT

e4bo1z,"I'm going to say YTA. Not because you are having a baby and have chosen to be stay at home parent, but because you don't seem to understand how not using your degree could upset your parents. I'm sure they made some major sacrifices to provide for your tuition, room & board, and spending money.  Maybe you will use your degree for employment later, but the longer you go without using it the less it will help you land a job. Hopefully your marriage works out and you won't need to support yourself financially. If it doesn't you will understand why many people postpone starting a family to get their careers started."
e4boa2,"NAH, but you may want to consider seeing a therapist."
e4brdy,Info: Are these ideas and projects expected from your typical work? Currently sounds like you want acknowledgement for just doing your job.
e4brnp,education is more important than a dead-end job
e4bwkp,"NTA. Your sister needs to knock it off. She has no business critiquing your home or cleaning it. Tell her that if she doesn’t stop, she’ll no longer be allowed in your home."
e4bzxv,"Damn, reading this post makes me feel soooo old.

ESH. Don't unfriend her, because I bet you'll make up in a couple months and you'll end up adding her again."
e4c21d,"NAH. This isn’t being dishonest. If you don’t need to turn your heat on, you’d be silly to do so."
e4c83s,"NAH. It sounds like just a really unfortunate miscommunication? Would you feel comfortable with not backtracking exactly, but rather just making it a positive thing? Like “now you know i want to marry you! But you can still totally propose to me!” 
Either way, he’s not wrong for wanting to propose to you and you weren’t wrong for proposing to him."
e4cay0,"NTA

It is your hair. 

But I do hope you're dying it for more reasons than ""Everyone at school had been asking me to"""
e4ccu7,"Controversial YTA 

You are a college student, which sounds like you don't live at home any more. It isn't your cat. The rest of your family got a cat and will continue to care for it. You are bonding with it while it is still a kitten and imprinting that it prefers your room while your siblings who will be around more are by default limited in interacting with it. You can't both ""set up spots for it"" and just pretend it just prefers your room. 

And you know what? It could be your siblings want to spend time with you and the kitten is a pretense. It's definitely a break, so you are entitled to spend it any where you like. Rent a b&b away from your family and do you work by yourself. Or you could have stayed on campus. You are grown up. But you decided no, I'll go home for thanksgiving. Your family has a reasonable expectation that you will spend time with them, especially the younger ones. But it's definitely assholic to be snippity with your EIGHT YEAR OLD SISTER who wants to play with a kitten and talk her older college age sister's ear off while you stay at her home! My two pence."
e4cd4y,Info: why can't you go by yourself or with friends without him?
e4cf39,NTA. It’s bad enough that he used your belongings without asking but he also went into your private space to retrieve the item and then lied about it.
e4ch76,NTA. You're dealing with immense pressure and you're young. Your feelings about your mother are valid and you're allowed to speak them.
e4cj00,YTA You're lacking the very basics of social media etiquette. You ask before you post other people's images. People don't have to ask you not to post them.
e4cnn3,ESH- ya'll are fucked up. Probably not a good idea to get married.
e4cs6z,"NTA it's your choice to have people in your life and if you don't want them in it then you don't have to. I have a very very messed up family and only talk to 1 aunt and a couple of my cousins and siblings. I am no contact with the rest of them and it makes my life so much better.

e4d1h3,Nta. You didn't feel comfortable and they made homophobic jokes IN FRONT OF SOMEONE WHO IS GAY.
e4d4bs,"YTA. Did you not realize that the messages refresh everywhere when new ones come in or go out? Also, it sounds as if you’re trying to make it sound like she purposefully snooped through your messages and just happened to see it. What probably happened is she saw the message from your coworker come in (because, ya know, you didn’t close the window) and then automatically saw your reply. That doesn’t quite qualify as snooping through your messages."
e4d6q0,"NTA. If your mom wants an invite, she needs to discuss that with your dad. It isn’t fair to ask you to get in the middle."
e4dbj2,"NTA. It doesn't make sense to assign the smaller bedroom to two children and the bigger bedroom to one child. Your parents are being unreasonable, but their house their rules I guess."

e4dvcs,"NTA.  I feel like people are using anxiety as a way to cover for themselves to do really rude things.  I’m not  suggesting anxiety isn’t real, not at all.   I have anxiety and that shit is a shitty mcturd. 

But using my anxiety as an excuse for bad behavior is wrong.  She should have communicated her state of mind/feelings during the trip.  

*but she can’t cause she has anxiety*

No.  It’s not an excuse.  For anyone dealing with anxiety I’m gonna be mad clear.  If we keep our experience to ourselves and then blame the world around us for not helping/“catering” to us we are wrong.  How the fuck anyone will know we’re going through something?

*but I don’t like confrontation*

Telling someone something isn’t negative.  Confronting something only means facing it.  If you *don’t* face it the problem usually evolves into something worse.  

So this friend was wrong.  All she had to do was pull you to the side and say the week was overwhelming.  You and your fam could have adjusted things for her.   If she still wanted to go home you’d have a heads up.  

Guys I’m all about self care, boundaries, putting myself first and respecting my mental health but I won’t use my mental health as an excuse for rudeness.   NTA."

e4ehc8,"NAH

You aren’t an asshole, you’re just a teenage girl. And being a teenage girl can be rough. I know it doesn’t feel this way, but fifteen is so young. Your looks are going to change over the next few years, as are the tastes of the boys around you. 

Focus on the things that make you feel good about yourself — both your looks and your other gifts. Are you really good at one subject or activity? Are you really funny or a great friend? Everyone has things they are good at. Lean into those things.

Instead of telling your parents you want plastic surgery, maybe talk to your mom about less drastic things you can do to help you feel better about how you look (different haircut? family walks after dinner? more of your favorite shirt?).

The better you feel about yourself the more relaxed and attractive you will be.

Also, wear sunscreen."
e4emk0,"NAH. You are rightly feeling protective of your wife and it upsets you to see her run ragged by her GM and M. Her GM sounds like she is dementing. She is in her 80s and she is not going to be around for long. She is acting out of love. Please try not to show your resentment towards GM and M. Because if you do, your wife will feel even worse because she will be upset that you are upset. It will be another burden in her heart. Support her as best as you can. Are there any community support for elderly people where you live?"
e4et4a,"NTA. Go dance if you want to.

You're not going to ever be his long-term/life partner. The fact that he's keeping you secret from his family even after three years makes that clear. You're just his ""placeholder"" until he marries someone his family finds acceptable. I'm sorry, but that's the truth of the matter.

In addition to that he's making _you_ feel like what you enjoy doing is wrong and dirty, and that female sexuality isn't acceptable to express.

This relationship of yours will end at some point, so I'd get out before he makes you even more miserable."
e4ezyx,"NAH. You aren't required to buy them, but she's allowed to do what she wants. I hate smoking too but my grandma just wants to die and honestly I feel sad that she's still here. If she wanted to smoke, i wouldn't buy em for her, but I don't think I'd stop her."
e4f5k5,"YTA. If your partner is the one who will be looking after the child on weekends, then she ABSOLUTELY should have been involved in the discussion. She's not supposed to be the one taking care of the child all the time. You are. He's your son. It sounds like you and your ex need to get a formal custody arrangement set up and you need to start taking your partner's opinions into consideration before going along with whatever your ex wants, otherwise I doubt you'll be having a partner for too much longer."
e4f9vh,"Completely unrelated but what a shite gift (IMO) 

At least a bottle of wine or something has a purpose..."
e4flqh,"NTA - you owe your family nothing. Put yourself and your husband first, it sounds like you have a lot of healing to do and they’re not going to be remotely helpful with that. I wish you both all the best!"
e4fpv8,"NTA - but I've never understood why people care so much about their things when living in a group setting, Especially with family. I feel like it's easier to just share now and know that (hopefully) you'll eventually be in a financially stable place where you don't have to share with anyone you don't want too. I get the urge to punch your sibblings over using your stuff but in the long run its just stuff and this is just temporary."
e4frcz,NTA you'll continue to make and lose friends for your entire life. Learn a lesson and move on to friends who don't make you uncomfortable.
e4ft0l,NTA - “My wife and kids are my family. They are most important to me.” - that should be enough of a reason.
e4fvj4,"YTA - number 1,  for butting into a conversation that doesn’t involve you. Number 2, for belittling other people’s lives. I’m sorry but I find it hard to believe that you were so evolved as a teenager to not care about ANY “petty meaningless” things.  You can be thinking about college and going to a party. 

And number 3, for pretending at age 25 that you’re some wisen old sage who’s giving such pearls of wisdom to young whippersnappers, how dare they not take your advice. Dude, wake up. You’re still basically a kid yourself, successful business or not. And you clearly have a lot to learn about compassion and people."
e4fvjn,"I know I'm in the minority here, but nta. 

My wife grew up with a mom who would have no food but there would be beer in the fridge. There would be days without electricity or phone, but she'd have her cigarettes.

e4fxoe,"NTA - unless your boss is heavily invested in you and your career, they are always going to do what's best for themselves and the company.

e4glaw,"YTA. While being able to be honest with our friends is important, there was no need to put down her interest in that way. You don’t know if she would actually be a good nurse. The fact that she isn’t a traditionally social person doesn’t mean she couldn’t be a good caretaker. She seemed to enjoy, and do well with assisting her elderly neighbour, so why wouldn’t she do well in other similar situations."
e4gld8,"YWBTA. Your partner doesn’t want you to do this, and since it’s their name I feel like what they want matters more than you getting satisfaction from petty revenge."
e4glrw,NTA holy crap is this guy still hugely popular now?
e4gqcd,"Haha, NTA. They're manipulating you into trying out their product; classic scam/mlm technique."
e4gs80,"YTA. I think if you viewed women as people to be friends with first instead of just potential dating candidates that this situation could have been avoided.  I guess it’s one thing if you’re just looking to hook up, but that’s not really what friends’ parties are for..

If you aren’t trying to “waste time” talking to women with boyfriends, I’d say skip the party altogether because the girls there probably don’t want to talk to you anyway."
e4gty4,"NAH it's your birthday and you should do what you want to do, even if that's nothing. 
Maybe if you explained all of this to the people who are buying the gift, they would understand, you seem like a loving family. 

Maybe you should suggest a different idea like ""I really love that you are trying to make my birthday special, what would really make it amazing, is if instead of Vegas we used the money to have a family trip to (insert a place you would like to go)"". 

That way, your family still get to spoil you like they want, but it's also more what you would want to do rather than Vegas."

e4h5fx,"NAH. His mother put you in a tough spot, no doubt interpreting you as a better friend than you were (after all, you came over in a restaurant and hugged him!).

She put her pride before the animals wellbeing."
e4huc7,"YTA just because you're ""above it"", doesn't mean that ""fat"" isn't a negative descriptor to the rest of the world. I love my body, as a ""Fat Girl"" and I hate it when people think I'm being self-loathing when I describe my body as fat. But I also wouldn't want my friend describing me as ""the fat one"" because I'm more than my body and it *does* imply that I'm the odd one out because I'm fat."
e4i0am,YTA for not taking the time to write a letter. And showing others jumping a turnstile is acceptable.
e4i12l,"NAH. 

There are scientific links between overuse of technology and things like disrupted sleep patterns, stress, depression, etc. (This trend is especially spiking with children and teens.) Your mom isn't wrong to make the changes she did if technology use is an issue. I can't tell you whether or not you or your siblings are ""overusing."" If there are good changes happening, then she should stick with what's working. 

However, it's not necessarily fair for her to punish the ""household"" on the actions of your siblings. You make your post seem like the consequences are more based off of their actions than yours. If this is how you feel, maybe talk to her. 1-2 hours of gaming here and there isn't the end of the world as long as you are doing ok otherwise. But maybe she is seeing something you're not."
e4i3u4,"NTA. Even if it’s true it may have been assholish to bring up unprompted, but at that point she had it coming when she tried to attack your parenting as an absent parent."

e4iajj,NTA. I think this is good parenting. Your step-daughter needs to understand how her actions are affecting others. I think this is a gentle way to help her learn this lesson and will hopefully make her more mindful of others around her.
e4ifkx,"NTA.  For people who aren't into kids, a party full of them is a nightmare.  Parents often get upset because their friendships die after they have kids, but they have to understand that their friends don't want to get together in situations that revolve around children."
e4ihzc,"YTA because of this. Don't embarrass your sister like this. If you know she's in there stay out it's not difficult. Should she lock the door, eh, she should respond to knocks, yes.

e4jhol,"NTA but it does sound like your wife views you cleaning the shed as you getting away from the family, and maybe views her cleaning the bathroom as being in service to the family, and perhaps that’s the disconnect.

And you have to be careful not to over-accuse - jumping to pointing out hypocrisy (her having a character flaw, and you being the judge) rather than trying to understand why she views it differently is perhaps not the best move on your part.

Hope you can talk it out with her."
e4jkta,"YTA because it's depression, not ""depression."" No one needs friends who doubt everything they say."

e4klee,"YTA

At this point I would be more concerned with why she has changed so much and then wonder if you still want to support her. 

Maybe she is just busy or overwhelmed.

Or maybe she is just only sees you as reliable ATMs.

e4l6qq,"NTA Howdy from Texas.  I want to address this a couple of ways if you please.  1) I think you and I both know 14 horses and a 9 stall barn on only 3 acres isn’t right (is it even legal there???) Typically you need at the very bare minimum an acre a horse and that’s just bare grazing.  A stall per horse is also standard care. It sounds like she’s gotten in over her head.  2) I agree whole heartedly with you backing off helping them because what seemed to be a favor in the beginning, appears to now be a burden she’s trying to guilt trip you in.  Stand your ground.  On a side note, the horses really need to be looked at properly and if she’s starting to age in years to where she physically can’t look after them, perhaps it’s time to help her look into other options such as selling the farm.  In the end, the ones suffering the worst will be the animals."
e4lbva,"Let me guess, you’re all teenagers? He should hug who he wants. He’s not kissing her, not grabbing her ass. Don’t be jealous- it’s unattractive. YTA"
e4lpln,"YTA. You told her to stop buying you bracelets, so she’s giving you cash instead. That shows a respect for your boundaries and receptivity to feedback. Maybe it’s not because she’s trying to buy you; maybe she’s just showing you that she still considers you part of the family and she hasn’t forgotten about you and doesn’t want to give up on you. Assuming your grandma’s worst offense is just being excessively religious, you’re being mean. 

You don’t have to go to Christmas. But you should make more of an effort to be kind to your grandma, who clearly misses you.

Consider having a heart to heart about why you’ve distanced yourself. And consider whether there is a third avenue where you can have a cordial and respectful relationship where religion doesn’t come up. 

(fwiw: my parents are also overbearingly religious, and I just grey rocked the shit out of them whenever they brought it up, and now they just don’t bring it up around me anymore.)"
e4lpsw,"1.  NTA.  If he wanted you there, then he would have invited you himself,

e4m5um,"NAH. You both have pretty reasonable stances and I think its up to you both to figure out how to handle this. It's hard having a pet that could remind you of one that has passed, but it also sucks to give up on owning a breed you've owned most of your life because itll make your partner sad.

My parents let me fail a really big project like that in 4th or 5th grade because I just didn’t want to put the effort into it and it taught me (a wildly overachieving Type-A student) that everything requires effort if I want a good grade, and a lot of that requires planning.

Do you have a friend you can stay with?"
e4mtib,"NTA but do you have a lease?  While it sounds like he’s an asshole it’s hard to tell without knowing his side.  If you guys have constant disagreements (regardless of who is right) and you have no lease, then I am not surprised that he used that power card."
e4my1m,"NTA. It's hard to do work for an organization you're not passionate about. Your mental and physical health need to be your priority right now, and your mum will figure it out. It may mean that she needs to scale back the size of her rescue, or find some sort of outside funding to help her staff it, but that's not your responsibility. 

You spent years doing something you actively hated for your mother, it isn't fair to you that she put that on you (whether she meant to or not) and you are totally justified in putting yourself first and taking steps to make yourself happier and healthier. 

Best of luck to you with everything!"

e4nfyg,Nah but you guys need communicate better and work on your finances together so you both know what is going on. There is no excuse for you not to know whether your loans are being pair or not. You're a fool if you our your financial future in anyone elses sole control.
e4nhq5,"YTA
Don’t take this as me saying that you’re a bad person, you’re not. This is a difficult situation to traverse and it’s ok to be confused. However, you know information that could save this man from possibly years of turmoil due to this. If he finds out now before kids, marriage, and you know, life he can, in time, be ok. He can break of the relationship and move on. If you say nothing, there’s a high chance she cheats again and there could be more than just a house on the line, ie kids. I would say be upfront but expect some form of backlash. Good luck OP"
e4nmoe,NTA- are you really contemplating risking an advancement in your career so your bf can continue to be lazy? Please take the job. Who knows if you will get another opportunity. They fact that he is asking you to turn this down is also concerning as well. Something to think about with your partner. They should be encouraging and bring you up. Frankly he sounds selfish.
e4nn5v,NTA and please ignore the people telling you that's you're overreacting or seem crazy. If this post was about someone destroying someone's video games or other nerd crap there would be no question. Destroying your personal belongings is NEVER excusable under ANY circumstances.

e4ny15,Of course but you did it in a manipulative way. You could have easily said yes I’m excited to pick you up because I’ve had a rough day and I need a hug. Instead you expected her to know you needed support by asking a weird question and she seemed immediately annoyed by it.
e4ny3n,NTA she's upset with you because you wouldn't let her cheat.
e4nyzy,NTA. your dad is being emotionally abusive by threatening you with suicide/giving up custody.
e4nz7u,NTA he doesn’t get to decide who hooks up with whom and if it’s because he has feelings for her then he needs to communicate that more than just demanding you don’t get together.

This is the most heart wrenching thing I've ever read. Your dad is a complete fucking asshole. I don't care HOW grief stricken he was, it wasn't your fault and he shouldn't have made you suffer for it. He should have let you enjoy your birthday, what is WRONG with him?!

I'm so sorry about your mom, I'm so sorry your birthday celebrations were stolen from you. I'm so, so sorry. Please have a good birthday and enjoy your cake. Happy birthday, friend."
e4o1wo,"NAH, if she’s considering getting a one that’s secondhand it only makes sense To give her yours. But DO NOT give it to her on her birthday or as a gift. Just give it to her and explain she can have it if she’d like it because you are looking to change brands. It has nothing to do with her birthday. For her birthday give her actual gifts. Don’t even bring up the watch or money at all."
e4o407,"NAH It’s hard to tell sometimes when someone considers you their best friend, especially at a younger age. It sucks you didn’t feel it was mutual but it’s a learning curve in friendships overall as you grow older. Does it suck you didn’t see it that way? Sure but you didn’t have bad intentions."
e4o4k5,"YTA

You found things that were not yours and acted as if they were. How do you even possibly think you are not the asshole here? Obviously you are. Its not your business where he keeps his stuff or if he uses it. It's HIS.

**Edit** to add that the rest of the details about your roommate are irrelevant. You added those to make yourself look better, and tbh this is one of the most biased posts I have seen here. You didn't even try to be impartial."
e4o648,NTA but i would tread lightly. And be prepared to lose a friend.
e4o65t,"NTA. You said that you’d waited for them to cross and that they didn’t. And then when you started turning they moved. Maybe they didn’t see the light change, who knows. 

I think your neighbor was just being judgy. You said the father and son didn’t notice so the neighbor is making a big deal out of nothing, I’d say."
e4o8ar,"NTA. Yeah, it's probably a hurtful thing to say, but you came from a place of honesty, not so much as wanting to offend your mother.

Alcoholism and depression left unchecked can cause a lot of harm to others, whether or not the harm is intended. Unless your mother can genuinely recognize the changes she needs to make and actively work towards achieving the changes, it's understandable why you feel the way you do and wouldn't want her behavior/actions influencing any future children you could have."
e4oc0j,YTA if you limit the policy to just your mom and grandma. Why not extend it to the whole family and do a baked goods exchange instead? That way you wouldn’t be alienating just your mom and grandma.
e4og5s,NTA. Always remember that your boss wouldn't risk their life for you.
e4ogcl,"YTA- Good job burying the content. You cheated on your wife, she was upset enough that her last words were grievances with you, and she died horribly and drawn out. That traumatizes a kid! Meanwhile you have a ""family assistant"" who seems more of a parent than you considering who she turns to for help even if it is just money.  

You think maybe your daughter is acting out because you have been terrible to her mother and clearly not involved enough in her life to have an idea of what is going on? Your description of her friends sounds like you disapprove of everything. Were it drugs and age alone, you may have a point, but throwing ethnicity in there is an eyebrow raiser.  

Moving will just lead her to fall in with the first crowd she finds that she knows you will hate because it sounds like she hates you and it sounds like you have given her reasons. If you want to fix this, you have a lot of work ahead of you and it won't start until you can admit how much you have failed her already. If you want to stick to fighting the symptoms rather than the root cause, don't worry about moving. She will take care of that for you soon enough."
e4ogpc,You're NTA for wanting your parents to treat you like their child and not a roommate whose personal space they can't even respect.

e4oxa6,Dude nta its a cult
e4p1uw,NTA - Getting offended at cards against humanity means you probably shouldn’t play it.
e4p22r,NTA. Your mom sucks.
e4p8rv,NTA but from what you've said about this guy it does sound a bit like he's deliberately sitting in the room to be there while you do it and he comes across as a bit creepy. There's no need to change your routine as you live there and it seems your roommate has some relationship issues to work out.

e4pc98,"YTA your sense of humour kind of tells it all. It's funny among friends but at the expense of other. That's a typical asshole trait. Does that make you racist? No, however, the continuation of racism thrives through people like yourself that allows these things to be said in humour. I use to be the same way so I get where you coming from, but a friend broke it down of the harm it does even in jest."
e4pew3,"YTA - Not because you’re not right, but because you went about it in a way that will almost certainly cause your daughter to rebel against you. You should have been upfront with her. She would have been pissed, but ultimately, know you were acting with her best interests in mind."

e4qa84,"NTA but isn't 31 weeks pretty visibly pregnant? I totally hear you that your pregnancy is more about you and I'm sorry that they're making it about them but if you're worried about it being a secret, I feel like anyone who sees you will probably know anyway? some might not be worth the angst of trying to keep it a secret?

Break up with her. That behavior is unquestionably fucked."
e4qagw,"This might be unpopular but, YTA

It seems like you escalated everything to a point that was unnecessary.

Was he threatening your aunt's safety at the family meeting?

I would say that there are ways to deal with this before escalating it to police involvement. Talking to your aunt, for one. Encouraging her to leave her husband if you think that's apt. Hell maybe even talking to her husband if you feel so strongly about what he's said to her.

You would not be in the wrong for standing up for your aunt. Calling the police based on the facts you've provided, however, seems excessive.

EDIT: Info- on what basis did the police charge him with verbal abuse? Did they witness anything?"
e4qftz,NTA — it’s only natural for children to move out and make their own homes. The fact that she’s manipulative and takes advantage of you only means you need to do it more.
e4qg1a,NAH.  I understand their point about your s/o being 3 years older and possibly taking advantage of you.  Though I do think it's odd they're still not allowing you to go over as an adult.  You also didn't talk about your parents interactions with your s/o and his parents.  Could they not have trusted his parents but trust your sisters bfs parents?  I just think theres a lot of factors that can make the two situations very different and both you and them have good points.  You need to talk to them about letting you be an adult.
e4qjmc,I'm going to abstain from an official verdict here and just say please tell your mom about your anxiety and what boundaries you need so that you're able to show her love in a way that feels good for both of you.

e4qnw4,"NTA. I would decline the religious aspect of it, and you can do so without being the asshole. However, if she is looking at godparent status as ""if we die, will you be guardian for my child"" then there are ways to accomplish that without having to participate in a religious ceremony."

It's not fair to say a friend ""suddenly become part of the mothers group."" People have children, and it's normal and nice, and it's something you aspire to. Don't write them off just because they have something you want.

I don't really think you're an A, I think you're going through something very difficult and you need to see a therapist to work through all this. But I do think you're in the wrong for isolating yourself from anyone who inadvertently says or does the wrong thing.

And if someone told me they were struggling to have children, I would never ask ""which one of you is the problem."" If anyone does ask you that, tell them you're not comfortable discussing it."
e4s30v,"YWBTA. First of all, if your ex is using the money to pay her rent, that is providing your kids with a place to live and is a completely appropriate way of spending the money.

e4sdbi,"ESH - Coming from a dad of 3 and one is a step- daughter, never put the kid in the middle. Wake up and get you SO out of bed if needed, but don’t let that little girl be embarrassed or stressed because she’s late. It isn’t her fault. Plus, kids thrive on routine. Her entire day would be thrown off by getting there late. It doesn’t matter if me and my wife are fighting, all my kiddos know I’d move heaven and earth for them.

e4sjr5,"NTA it's a difficult situation to be in, when you're never good enough. Try to ignore your mom when you do your best and she's still not happy. As long as you're doing the best you can that's reason enough to be satisfied with your self."

You're allowed to have boundaries. In this case, this boundary is vital for you, as it's essential to not have temptations around for you to be able to stay on the wagon.

The person you were seeing is equally allowed to not be okay with respecting those boundaries. He's within his rights to not be sober.

It just means you two are incompatible. Ultimatums are often unreasonable and unnecessary - but this isn't one of those times where the ultimatum was bad.

You did what's right for you. You're not an asshole. 

Don't second-guess yourself; rather, be proud that you could stand up for your own needs.

Stay the course. You've got this."
e4ubvo,"YTA- Not for the rejection, but for the shirt.  You seem to only want to wear it to escalate the situation.  If you were just wearing it to wear it then that’s different.

It’s not appropriate for him to be keeping that. It’s explicit, and while we don’t know the relationship with the ex, I personally know I’d feel uncomfortable knowing my ex still had explicit images of me after a break up. Especially if he was with someone else.

e4xdp7,"YTA. It’s very sad that you dislike your daughter so much you would punish her and literally allow her to be homeless.

You say you’re just doing what your parents did to you but it’s hardly the same. You had the benefit of having your husband stand by you. He worked to support you while you stayed home with your children. Your daughter doesn’t have that. You are literally forcing your daughter and her infant out onto the street. You have a chance to help end the cycle of teenage pregnancy by watching your grandson so your daughter can get her education. Your grandson is statistically less likely to become a teen parent himself if he had a parent with a college degree.

Your daughter is 16. She is legally a child. If you are in the US you are not allowed to make her leave home, it is against the law to force your minor child to live on her own. She and your grandson could end up in CPS custody if you do this. She’s not even old enough to sign a lease for an apartment, some places won’t even hire a 16 year old for a job."

At the very least your mom and grandmother should on top of things like his being up and making noise at 3 AM. A twelve year old should be asleep long before then during the school year.   
They also should know and care that he's tagging, especially if he's so dumb as to use his own name. This could get him into legal trouble. It could also escalate into worse vandalism.

e4xmf8,"NTA it doesn't sound like 'you're no longer in the honeymoon stage' it sounds like he is completely disinterested in the relationship.

If he can't be bothered to talk to you for 10 minutes without napping, but he can video chat with his family for 5 hours straight, I think you know where you stand. Personally I think he's TA for stringing you along and not just telling you he isn't that into you."
e4xn4j,"You guys have some serious issues if you guys are communicating this poorly. Or, on his side, not communicating at all."
e4xo72,"NTA. Quit if you feel that's the best option for you. Consider putting the reason you quit in writing to your manager (and if applicable, to their boss/HR) because you never know when you'll need the documentation to back you up."
e4xoed,"NTA. Not really the sub for this, but note the drama and remember that it will never stop. If you don't want the drama, don't hang out with these people. You are the company you keep."
e4xp3m,"NAH. You and your boyfriend clearly had different views on how much communication was necessary. I understand you getting upset, especially because the project was kind of your project, too. I understand him just wanting to relax and figuring a generic answer would be ok. You both are in the clear, but in the future try to be clearer on what kind of communication you want."
e4xpqr,"NTA, also not the sub for this, try relationship_advice or relationships."
e4xsh8,"NTA/NAH

This all depends on how accurate their statement that they were busy working is.

Obviously you aren't the asshole, because it sounds like you pretty much have it your all and your request wasn't unreasonable; however if they *were* actually busy, you can't really blame them for not taking up the work that you were meant to do.

Also, if S focused on the wrong thing *by mistake* then he also can't be blamed, we're all human. Of course, if he was just pissing about then he's an asshole."
e4xv6d,"NTA but your fiance is. 

He didn’t do the bare minimum of running the dates by people who he needs/really wants to come. 

You just made these plans and your wedding is over a year away. You haven’t even sent out invitations it sounds like. So, I don’t understand why rescheduling is so impossible for y’all if you really want him to come. Is the church really so in demand you can’t find another date?

The fact your in-laws are refusing to discuss the wedding at all now makes me feel like something more is going on."
e4xxe0,"YTA - Visit friends and loved ones while you can. You never know if something horrible will happen to them. Especially if they live far away, take the opportunity to see them. i think since you haven't flown in so long, maybe that could make up for it?  your morals are totally valid but I think you should reconsider your current decision. Is there another mode of transportation? Maybe look into other options."
e4xy87,"YTA, but a very light one. You had spent the whole of this trip knowing you were behind, but made no effort to get ready early on the day of leaving.

There's no reason, though, that the friend on your flight couldn't have waited. Then you would have had someone to walk with, and the friends on the earlier flight could still make their flight."
e4y2wg,"I feel like we need a little more context than this but you are never the asshole for removing toxic people from your life. So even without much information, my judgment is NTA."
e4y4s5,NTA. Relationships with in-laws can be so difficult to navigate. Yours don’t seem to be very understanding people at all.
e4y90y,"NTA. Your kid has no decent immune system yet so its a valid concern to have them around another sick child. Also, if your wife is just 3 weeks post c-section, she should still be resting up, shouldn’t be carrying a car seat, etc."
e4ycsr,Hell no. Definitely NTA for your neighbors mooching off the kindness of your parents. They are even bigger As for trying to guilt trip you by sending their young kids to get you to turn it back on. I sincerely hope your parents cut them off for being such scumbags.
e4ymd3,"NTA your parents’ reaction to learning that you have a working memory is strange. I’d give it back to them like when they say “OP is so petty he’ll remember for a decade”, tell them it’s normal for brains to retain information and if need help remembering which door is their bedroom tell them you’ll lead them by the arm to remind them which one. 
   Same with the “I hope OP doesn’t go snitching” nonsense. Laugh at their immature reaction and flat out tell them to Grow Up. That’s the sort of crap that little kids say to pretend that they’re tough."
e4ynyl,NTA Just tell her you won't be involved with her bridesmaid drama.  It's not your job to mediate things for her.
e4yqhu,YTA. If you have a certain way you want your clothes put away then he should leave it out after they’re clean for you to put away in your specific way
e4yrda,"NTA - they stayed in your house and didn't keep it clean, and then went into your bedroom and your private bathroom without asking FIRST? No way. They've been weird as hell."
e4ytal,"

Judging by the fact that you don't know the difference between taught and thought, I would stop worrying about what other people know. YTA.

>He became even more upset when I mentioned that I though this was basic knowledge that people get thought in elementary school, and repeated until high school."
e4ytp9,"NTA 

You have to take care of yourself as well. Take some time to recharge and don't feel guilty about it."
e4yvxj,"YTA, but mildly. Wearing headphones, whether fully or one in one out, signals to your family that you’re busy and don’t want to talk to them. That’s fine when it’s occasional, but not when you’re always doing it. You’re putting them in the position where they feel like they *always* have to interrupt you in order to talk to you, and that can’t be pleasant for them."
e4ywh6,"NTA. This woman wants your forgiveness so she can die feeling guilt free (to put it bluntly). If you’re not capable of that or ready to, that’s on her. She’s had a lifetime to connect and form a relationship with you, you’ve reached out to her over and over, you should not feel guilty for not wanting to give her your forgiveness (even if you feel it is not owed because you are thankful for being adopted). She shouldn’t have waited until her time was finite, this seems more like a selfish maneuver on her part. It’s for her, not you. Don’t let people guilt you, do what’s best and right for yourself. 


Will it matter to you after she’s been gone for a few years and didn’t get the chance to forgive her? If you think your stance could change in the future, I would consider it."
e4ywvx,"Sorry, but YTA here. The issue isn't that you spent Thanksgiving with friends. The issue is that you traveled to a new city with your mother on a very special, family-centric holiday and then left her on her own so that you could spend time with your friends instead. It you wanted to spend the holiday with your friends, then perhaps this was NOT a trip you should have taken with your mother."
e4yyx2,"NAH

Here’s why, if your son has consistent time management issues this is something I’d consider looking in to. Because if the root cause is something like a executive dysfunction, this “teaching” method won’t make a dent. This doesn’t read as malicious on your part. I don’t think your wife is being an abject asshole, nor your son."
e4z3sy,"NTA, I used to feel bad about leaving retail jobs because I liked the people I work with. But at the end of the day, retail workers are so easily replaceable and corporations will f you over at any moment for a chance at more profit, so I don’t think you should feel bad in the slightest."
e4z44t,NTA. Pay child support and be done with it. An absent parent is much better than one who doesn't want to be there.
e4z45e,YTA for placing the blame on your sister when it’s your parents who are shit heads
e4zdwn,"Run... don’t walk. 

Try a different sub, you need relationship advise, not this."
e4zfpg,"NTA

Ditch her, she sounds draining. 

There's no point sacrificing your enjoyment."
e4zjjc,"NTA.

Your sister sounds entitled and I wouldn’t share it either, if the person simply assumed they could have it without asking first. The balls on that one.

But I’m also super into not sharing food unless I feel like it. I’ll share anything except food, to be honest. And only two or three people can take my food without me getting slightly annoyed."
e4zk4z,"Not necessarily an asshole, but you're an idiot for using a phrase you didn't understand."
e4zm0e,"ESH. You need to agree on how you;re going to handle this as a couple.

I'll add that I'm not American, and there seems to be an emphasis there on encouraging children to actually believe in Santa Claus, even at the age where they're beginning to question it, but I personally don't see why you can't enjoy Christmas traditions without actually insisting on their veracity. If your son's ""appearing to believe for your sake,"" it's gone too far.

>So AITA for just wanting to have a few special Christmases with my son?

That's actually a loaded question, because nobody - not even your wife - is suggesting that you can no longer ""have special Christmases with your son."" I think if you compromise with her, you'll be reminded of really matters here, and that's that you all find a way to enjoy Christmas together."
e4znb9,"YTA. 

Every dog is “well-behaved” until they aren’t."
e4zsva,I'm not going to lie. I had a really hard time reading this. But NTA because you stuck by your friend. People need more ride or die friends in their lives.
e4zu27,"NTA. As a knitter, in a family of “makers”, your brother’s reaction is appalling. Keep your keepsakes away. For now. Your nieces/nephews may learn the value of such love-gifts in the future. 

Also, I’ll gladly accept these creations 😂"
e4zwxv,"ESH. I agree that if she's at home with the children and you're working 12-hour days, the bulk of the cleaning should be her responsibility, and I'd say this if the genders were switched. But the way you said it was pretty disrespectful, and it sounds like you hadn't actually discussed the division of chores before, you just made an assumption. Looking after two children under 3 is hard work, and I wouldn't mind betting by the time you get home she's exhausted and has no idea where the time went. You both need to talk this over, and cut each other some slack.

>I make fairly good money and she is VERY comfortable with her spending.

That's a separate issue. You can't just throw in everything you don't like about your wife and hope it will influence judgments in your favour."
e5004n,"> I work out regularly with equipment I bought with scholarship money.

...Why didn't that money go towards your college tuition?

> I refused to get a job like a regular person and stayed home with the promise that I'd make something happen and eventually become independent through creating an online business. I haven't left since. That was 3 years ago.

YTA. Emotional reparations? Please; you're just a run of the mill leech."
e503v7,"NTA.

Which family members are complaining? You should talk to your dad directly about this. He is the only one that actually knows if he appreciates what you give him.

If he likes and uses your gifts, isn't that the whole  point? Should you give him a silk tie that he'll only use once in a while? Or another pair of slippers or mittens?

It sounds to me like your family members are getting their undies in a twist over how much you are spending on his gifts. And they know that they'd be assholes to gripe about that, so instead they gripe about ""utility,"""
e503wr,"NTA. I feel like you shouldn’t have called her a bitch, just should’ve said no and left it at that"
e504vc,"NTA.

Wtf this has nothing to do with you. If my in-laws were this crazy I'd be doing nothing but making popcorn."
e50845,"Yta if you actually used the phrase “my destiny lies elsewhere.” Otherwise I’d suggest you lighten up a little on the hometown hate, but it doesn’t make you an asshole to want to do something different from your old friends."
e508o1,Are you actually going to end a friendship for such a stupid reason? A trolley? Of all things?
e509q0,"ESH

She sucks for obvious reasons.

You responded to her bitching about you being unfair by turning around and actually being unfair. And you're shooting yourself in the foot- if you're really giving her way too much work, then she will be able to compile evidence and eventually your bosses will notice, and then you'll probably lose your delegating privileges in general.

Assign her stuff you don't like, that's fine, but don't blatantly give her a disproportionate amount to do."
e50at3,NTA. You were 30. The implication that you didn't/don't know what you want/don't want at 30 is astounding.
e50c7m,"YTA -- Don't call out, that's fine. But then find some way to get your own grown ass to work. 

You can't try to force your mother to drive in conditions she's not comfortable with while simultaneously going on about how you refuse to drive because you once got in an accident, right? That's be bonkers. Did I mention YTA? Drive yourself or hush up and call out."
e50c8p,"NTA It's your house, you get to decide who/what comes into it. Your friend is probably upset they can't smoke with you and are taking it out wrongly."
e50ekj,"NTA especially if comments in the paper don’t match the grade on the rubric. The problem with their swapping system is that it opens you up to bias from other teachers. Asking from a second opinion, if not from your teacher, then from a 3rd teacher, seems reasonable."
e50evd,YTA for deliberately using the wrong pronouns. No wonder your daughter (who is too young to be TA) doesn’t want this girl there. Children learn from their parents.
e50fcl,"NAH

You were grateful and polite. You can't change your feelings.

Can you ask your Dad to help set up the new computer in a way that is comfortable for you to work? It sounds like he is knowledgeable and skilled. That will show him you really do appreciate the gift, and help you get the best out of it"
e50j82,"NTA Even is there was something wrong in the towel closet, having them neatly folded will help.  If she had told you the issue, you could have fixed/moved them around to her liking.   
Sounds like she was in a lot of pain and that her pain isn’t managed very well (maybe she can’t afford medication?). Hopefully she will calm down and appreciate your efforts."
e50kgp,"While it's alsways objectively true you only get to hear one side of the story,this one just feels extra onesided.

>I was best friends with this woman for years, let's call her Pamela. We had our ups and downs, but always stayed strong, and we always had each other. The recent years I've expanded my social network quite a bit, and as a result I think she started to get insecure.

Your story of what went wrong ends with an assumption. That's never good because it means you two never got to talk that shit out. That's what happens sometimes.

You make Pamela sound like a toxic bitch, but I'm sure Pamela could make you sound like a toxic bitch in a reddit post too.

You need the judgement of friends or family who has a chance at knowing both parties.

Reddit will keep telling you NTA because of your extremely onesided portrayel of Pamela as a complete asshole."
e50paq,"NTA

Client was informed what was required to achieve what they asked for. Client failed to provide such conditions. I wouldn’t edit the photos beyond what you would have if you had gotten your photo spot. If they want you to heavily retouch or edit the photos to mimic what they WOULD have gotten, I feel that’s extra hours on your part and so would require a additional compensation."
e50qc7,"Hmm... is this an AITA issue?

It sounds like your mom has some issues, because she isnt really acting or presenting herself the way an adult should. I think you need to talk to your father about your concerns."
e50uqm,she definitely needs to pay you but asking original price for a 6 year old laptop is ridiculous
e50w8i,"NTA, if they weren't letting you participate after you asking multiple times then theres not really anything good for you to say about them, group activities are supposed to be group efforts that everyone works on together"
e51143,[deleted]
e512ru,"YTA, you're living in her house and she's been kind enough not to charge you rent. Get your self one of those insulated lunch bags that can be put in the fridge. Pack yourself a lunch from the left overs when the food is ready, or just use your words and ask your mom and boyfriend to save a little food for your lunch. You don't sit up in her house, living rent free and then have the audacity to refuse to offer her dinner."
e512zs,"NTA. The wedding is the most important thing to your sister, your classes are the most important thing to YOU. Your mother is wrong for trying to pressure you into prioritizing the wrong thing. When a wedding is scheduled to take place \*right before\* the end of the semester, I think just managing to physically be present is all anyone should be expecting of you. That goes triple for a ""destination"" wedding.

I also think you should step down as the MoH in your sister's wedding. The MoH has a lot of responsibilities, and right now you don't have the time (or money) to take them on. So tell her you'd like to step down so that either one of her friends or maybe one of your SILs can take that role instead."
e51dil,"NTA because that place is a just bad for your health.

Don't avoid the conversation. Be very clear with your husband that why you can't go. Explain, that you are not saying this to criticize them, but their lifestyle has side effects, namely that they way they live is just bad for your health and you need to limit your exposure to it.

Avoiding confrontation is not healthy for a relationship. It just kicks the issue down the road and when it does come up it is 100 times worse."
e51fq3,"NAH

You need to discuss this. Calmly, lovingly, but you need to talk about it, before the resentment really kicks in.

My advice. One parent gets up and does everything each night, but you alternate nights. No reason for both of you to be awake."
e51ggh,"NTA

1. You got your grandmother's blessing
2. Your grandfather doesn't care. He's dead."
e51jyo,"NTA, i would not consider him a good guy. That is legetimate manipulation. He manipulates you into staying and profiting of your talents. I would report it to HR since if he did this to you, he will probably do it to someone else if he's never in trouble because of it"
e51l4j,"NTA, but I do think you could have done a tad better. It's completely understandable to kind of freeze up when someone else snaps, so I can't blame you for standing there and basically just thinking WTF, but it's not like her frustration came out of absolutely nowhere or was a frustration that you hadn't experienced yourself. You didn't have to back her up, but when she and the neighbor started arguing you could have intervened to try to mediate and maybe explain how you both have felt in the past in a less aggressive way in order to defuse the situation a bit. Your neighbor may still have been pissed, but it could have helped alleviate the situation a little too. And while your girlfriend's reaction towards you is a little inappropriate, I think maybe just take into account where she may be coming from. Clearly she's in the wrong, but it wouldn't hurt if you acknowledged to her that you completely understand why she would want you to have her back in any kind of stressful situation, even if she was very obviously handling things in the wrong way in this instance."
e51m23,"NTA

You’re paying for a fair education, the laziness created an unfair advantage. I’d definitely report it."
e51mdb,"NTA. He has a chore, either complete or dont expect a prize for half assing it, especially if he knows that you’ll just swoop in and finish it. That’s a total dick move."
e51ng0,"NAH (I'm sticking strictly to the ticket conundrum and at any rate you've taken responsibility for the falling out)

""...COUPLE have decided they don’t want to continue with the friendship."" I think you and your BF have to respect that and leave them alone. Besides, I doubt they want to sit next to you two at this show. If they really want to go, they will buy their own tickets, I would think. Unless they are cheaper than they are offended."
e51oss,NTA. If this like a dormitory common room space it’s free use and it is a common room/area where in which people use it all the time. It isn’t part of her room it’s part of the shared agreement that you have
e51pd1,"ESH, but I understand where you're coming from. Your stepmom is clearly the asshole, and you responded in an asshole manner, but as a fellow clothing reseller the thought of someone carelessly trashing a freaking BURBERRY BLAZER would probably drive me off the deep end too. Basic human decency indicates that if you borrow something from someone, ask first, and if you damage it, apologize and do what you can do to fix it. The fact that your stepmom has done neither is unfortunate, and you don't deserve to be treated that way. 

But with that said, to be frank, what's right and wrong doesn't matter in this instance. Your dad has demonstrated that she's on her side regardless of whether or not she's wrong, and the two of them are in control of your living situation. So, deal with it in whatever way is easiest for you, and be glad that they won't be in control of it for much longer."
e51q0h,"Do you have to say it?

Can you make socializing with them a dine-out situation? Stay in a hotel and dine out.

NTA"
e51szf,You don't use enough periods.
e51tz0,"NTA, you've split up and if she wants to choose a low paying career that's on her. I'd suggest getting a lawyer though as it sounds like she's counting on child support to bank roll her income above needs for the child, especially as you have  him almost 50% of the time."
e51vp1,NTA It's the MoH's job to organize the bachelorette party. You give your input and she ultimately does the scheduling or organizing. I don't blame you for wanting to be the lead in something like that.
e51w4m,"I dont think yta for receiving the gift, but yta for discounting your partner's feelings about it. It may be nothing to you, but its clearly not to him. it's not fair to your current relationship to put a past partner's desire to give gifts above your current partners (reasonable) discomfort with it."
e51yhd,"NTA. Bedbugs will not go away. They will multiply and everyone in her house will eventually get them, then their homes will be invested. 

There are a very small percentage of people who for whatever reason don't get bitten by bedbugs. Maybe she is one of these people. Has she been bit? She would have red itchy welts if she has. 

Regardless of whether or not she is bitten by them most of her friends at parties will get them and they are really bad. So you should tell everyone for their own protection."
e51ymb,"NTA

Pay her back for the meals, the rest is yours."
e51za7,"Girlfriend here. First off, it's ADD, not OCD. Second, I never asked you to come because I know it irritates you. I was perfectly content to do the shopping on my own, and then as I was leaving you told me, completely unprompted, ""don't take 2 hours about it this time."" When I asked what that meant you had a go at my shopping by recipe.

I do find it easier to shop by recipe because I'm still figuring out my medication for my, again, ADD, the symptoms of which include lack of attention to detail, forgetfulness, and, shockingly, attention deficit. If I have a list done by recipe then it helps me keep track of what I'm getting and I know that I need to get this, that and the other for Monday and this, those and these for Tuesday ect so I don't lose track. I've tried other methods, and I'm sure there are other methods I could use, but this one is the one I happen to find easiest. I've tried going by category but that leads to me forgetting something or not getting enough of something.

He did say it drove him crazy, which pissed me off because he uses it the way someone else would use ""babe"", as in greeting me with ""hey crazy"". I've asked him to stop multiple times because I really hate being called crazy but he still does it.

And then, to top it all off, he posts this extremely biased account to make me seem MORE crazy hoping it'll shame me into changing my shopping method.

YTA."
e521go,"If you have to ask, don't do it."
e523cg,"NTA. The smell of smoke is nasty, and I wouldn't be able to handle that either."
e527pq,"ESH
Coworker for kissing you knowing you have a bf.

Bf for telling you not to tale the ride home, but not coming to get you because he's ""hanging out"". That's a saftey issue. Seems like he doesn't care if you're safe.

You for not telling the coworker it was inappropriate and not telling your bf what happened."
e527yt,"NTA. Honestly I’m a spiteful bitch, it’d be fun to watch her open that box."
e52b8e,"YTA - it's a lot of money and you're allowed to be annoyed about it, but be so privately or to people who didn't know and aren't grieving over your grandmother.

What good did you honestly think was going to come from complaining about it to your siblings who are grieving? You had the good sense not to complain about it to your mom since it's not her issue to deal with, what made you think it was ok not to extend that courtesy to your siblings?"
e52boc,"YTA 
She's known him longer than you. You trust her to look after your baby. She's a reliable, trustworthy person.
She took an eleven year old to McDonald's on his birthday. Even if he ate the saltiest, fattiest, most sugar drenched thing on the menu it was one meal and won't harm him. It's a fun trip for a kid, especially if it's not something he gets to do often.

She took him to visit her family, presumably because they've known him for a long time and wanted to wish him a happy birthday. That's kind and a chance for him.to meet people outside his usual social group

What's particularly concerning is that an experienced professional who knows your stepson very well says she ""feels sorry for him"" and you dismissed her concerns.  
I think you should speak to get further and find out what she means, and if there's something wrong"
e52dls,NTA. This is why one has to be so careful when blending families. To go from having a room to being made to feel like a guest hurts. There should have been some conversation before any renovations happened. Give your dad a chance though. He knows he messed up and does want to fix it
e52gfx,"ESH.  Your brother isn't even required to give anyone gifts, but giving used and damaged gifts is tacky.  If you aren't eating for a week, you're spending too much on gifts.  Stop trying to make up for the kids lives by getting them expensive gifts and expecting anyone else to give expensive gifts."
e52h58,NTA - she is scared of the doctor and blame is easier to go with than fear.
e52ln4,"NAH

Mate don't be stupid, this was a golden opportunity. That woman deserves a gift after that lmao."
e52m6l,"NTA. This is unacceptable behavior. I am surprised how nobody seems to have noticed that she propositioned your son. The fact that your girlfriend is still willing to let her within range of your son speaks very poorly of her judgment.

Both you and your girlfriend have the right of veto-power over who gets to visit and this seems a good case to enforce it."
e52n2i,"YTA - you would rather others get more $ than your grandpa?  I don't think you realize how tough it is to save up $, let alone your grandpa sacrificing his own retirement and wealth so you can go to college. 

10 years later you may stumble upon this thread and realize how ridiculous this question is."
e52nc0,Nta. That's a stupid reason to get mad about something. Its fucking makeup.
e52nfi,"NTA. Many have this problem, me included. I cannot stand loud chewers and feel a sort of fight or flight response. I just turn the tv up louder or make sure not to sit too close because I risk getting frustrated and lashing out."
e52p3o,"NAH

They are not assholes for asking for help. You are not an asshole for refusing to give them money.  You are not an asshole for offering them money under certain conditions (ie they make a move that you believe will reduce their future need for financial help), since they can either accept it or not."
e52p97,"NTA. Your boyfriend sounds like one of those insane people who think they are so nice for treating animals like they are children. A cat doesn't know what 'I'll give you up for adoption means'. My cat doesn't know what I mean when I say 'keep waking me up at 6 am, you asshole, and I'll turn you into a fur collar'."
e52qlv,"YTA big time. It's your fault you hadn't slept in 48 hours. It's your fault you were driving dangerously, and you could have killed someone. It's your fault you slept through your alarm. And it's your fault you got replaced. The director should have replaced you sooner. You had the lead role and couldn't be bothered to make rehearsal."
e52sck,"NTA. 

He is kinda putting you out by using the garage. Instead of trying to get money for it, just don't let him park in the garage. 

""hey, it is starting to snow, I am gonna start using my garage!""

If he pushes back, then ask him to start paying you for it."
e52xnt,"NTA. That's exactly how it works, they won't be taking over your existing account - they'll be starting a new one. Call the utilities companies and tell them you want your account closed on X date. Let the roommates know your account is closing the day you move out, and that they can call to set up a new account to avoid service being interrupted. If their utilities get cut off it will 100% be on them."
e52yg6,"NTA

You're allowed to end friendships."
e530dr,"NAH

Yeah, it's a diet cookbook...for the diet she is explicitly on. I think it's a thoughtful gift."
e5317o,Ethical it ain't!!! But I would keep it 100%. Amazon it a notorious tax dodger and piss poor company to work for. Low wages and harsh conditions. Fuck em
e531ru,[deleted]
e5343a,"NTA. 

Emily thinks she has it bad? My husband died. Emily’s not allowed to feel/express her pain because I have it worse. How inconsiderate of her to talk about her military boyfriend when there are actual SPOUSES that have been widowed.  - editing to note that this is sarcasm.

Tell I said her she’s being a self-obsessed jerk. Her experience should be teaching her compassion."
e539er,"General rule of thumb, you dont step between siblings. Ever. No matter the argument, as long as it doesnt get physical. NTA."
e53bta,"YTA, twice over.

If dog poop is a problem, the DNA testing seems like a necessary step. But DNA tests cost money, so SOMEONE has to pay for it. If you're not charged that fee, that essentially means that it will be charged to everyone in the building by being bundled in with rent or whatever other fees you pay to management. To me, seems only fair that dog owners should pay for their dogs. Just like you don't know who it is, no one else in the building knows for sure that it's not you.

You're especially the asshole for being such a prick about a $30 fee that the staff were avoiding you. It didn't ""pay off."" You sold your dignity for $30."
e53dzs,NTA. Your sister in law sounds like she was being purposely obtuse and ignoring you so she could keep behaving how she wanted to.
e53fgq,"NTA. You did handle it correctly, very correctly. It is insulting, asking someone to bark like a dog for a bigger tip. Everything you said and did was right, and the guy made a fuss because he was embarrassed, as he should've been. Not the asshole, good for you!"
e53isz,"YWBTA if you tried to control what you’re employees wearing because it’s reminding you of your ex. It may be hers it may not be hers, maybe she just bought it because she liked it on her friend. Sorry about your break up but man don’t freak out on your coworker for the clothes they are wearing."
e53k13,"NTA. He's not your responsibility and you owe him nothing. His children can pay if they're that concerned, and can split the cost between them. If you're interested, maybe offer to chip in, but don't feel obligated to do so."

e53rl7,i think you’re making the conflicting birthdays an issue way too early...due dates can be sort of arbitrary. i’m one of 3 and none of us were actually born on our due date. seems like an unnecessary conflict to bring up with your already upset wife IMO
e53sqt,YTA for posting this when you know you're not TA of this story
e53vjw,"NTA - he crossed a line, and you were direct in asking him to dial it back.  He doesn’t need to be attracted to you in order to violate your personal boundaries.  His friends may think you were rude because many young people (girls especially) are conditioned to always be polite and not make others feel unwanted or unliked.  However, you have valid reasons for pulling back and no obligation to extend friendship to someone who makes you uncomfortable.  Your ability to be direct and communicate your feelings clearly will serve you well in life."
e53vqa,"NTA. She's three. Dates don't mean *anything* to her. It'd be different if she were like 8 and you were just flat out lying to someone who can tell time and read a calendar, but at three years old, having Christmas 3 days later isn't going to change anything."
e53wih,"NTA. If they don’t treat you kindly, you aren’t obligated to spend your holiday with them."
e53y14,"YTA. You sound exhausting. Why not apologize for something you feel you've done wrong, first, instead of waiting for her to come to you? You are the asshole for being ""picky' with apologies."
e53zl3,"NAH. You aren’t obligated to meet someone you don’t want to, but I think you should really think about it before you decline."

Can you take them with you? That might be a good teachable moment... them coming home to an empty house with no explanation."
e54cms,"YTA- This is a perfect example of elderly people being treated without  respect. It seems to me that as soon as someone is viewed as ""insignificant"" in society  they are open for public humiliation, scorn, ignoring their existence or general disrespt. When you live with someone you experience their personal moments and it is simple common sense to preserve your roommate, family member, spouse, children's privacy out of basic repsect and honoring the space that is shared by keeping your big mouth shut.  If you haven't already please hand write a letter of deep regret and offer to ammend the wrong doing.  Also, sincerely ask if there were other reasons she evicted you so rapidly because this sounds like the last straw that broke the camel's back, not the first offense."
e54deo,"NTA

Was it snarky? Sure, but this person was being an absolute dick to people who have no choice but to be polite because they're at work. People like that deserve a little reality check and you were in a position to give it to him. Fuck people who feel like they can talk down to others just because they're not in a position to defend themselves."
e54geg,"YTA

so you're excluding them because they (presumably) don't drink...

and because they (presumably) don't drink they won't be fun??

these are her friends and if the purpose of this trip is to spend it with other couple friends then yes, YTA. she even offered a compromise of another location but you don't think that's fun either?

maybe you're the one who isn't fun."
e54hky,"NTA

While disabled people also have a right to earn a living, if they are claiming disability and working more than the permitted hours, it is fraud. People like that make it so much harder for those who genuinely need help. And if it turns out that they are within their allowance, honestly, there is no harm done.

However, I also wouldn't continue to work somewhere where the hours were that fickle. Are your hours contracted or do they change week on week?"

But you should accept the position of supervisor. It will look better on your resume and will likely be for more pay. If you are going to be working there, you might as well be machiavellian about it.

Keep the work relationships cordial as well. Don't have to be close friends, but you never know when a work acquaintance now could be a useful connection in the future."
e54va2,"NTA - I have a great dislike for HOAs but this is the reason why they exist, so if they are going to exist (and you're going to be paying the dues for it) then you might as well use it to justify having your neighbor clean up his shit.

I’ve been stuck on the subway before for well upwards of 30 minutes, so it definitely happens (and indeed happens pretty often). 

You say this is totally unlike her, so instead of being worried about her, you leave the restaurant. She texted you at 7:38p and called you multiple times (just like you did). You didn’t check your phone for 20 minutes because you were on the subway and there’s no signal."
e550wr,"YTA.

Damn. This is cold. Your wife stopped to help someone else bring a new life into the world, and you're worried you lost some ""me time""? She then offered to make up for it, and that wasn't good enough?

This is very petty. You are 100% TA."
e55163,"NAH

She doesn't need her own room, but not having one pretty much says it's not her home. I moved away for almost 8 years and when I came back home, my room was there for me.

You couldn't afford the house. That's understandable, but just because your daughter is an adult now doesn't mean she can't have her own feelings regarding it."
e552i1,"NAH

This seems like a kid just not fully understanding a situation, which happens all the time. What are the chances she's already familiar with how a financial loan works? I don't think she was being a brat on purpose, that's a *lot* of money to a 12 year old. 

I also don't think you were wrong to ask for it, or to use authority when she refused. I think getting to the family Thanksgiving is more important than making a 12-year-old happy. In fact, good on you for offering the extra $5 if she would help. As long as you refunded her, all will be forgiven later in her life and this will be a silly story for family gatherings."
e552vp,YTA. MEPS is so easy to reschedule that it is actually offensive that you think it is more important than seeing your sister graduate. Whats worse is you know that is something you CAN reschedule. Whats worse is you decided to be an even bigger prick and try to compare your Father NOT BEING ALLOWED to return for important events to you NOT WANTING to go to your sisters important events. Instead of making excuses just tell your sister that you dont care shes graduating and you have no plans to improve the relationship between the two of you.

I can't really judge this as it seems like you want the best for the cat but contact the ""owner"" first. I personally think the cat is better off with you.

e55m29,"NTA. She's being really immature, and she needs to realize that there's more to life than sex."

Additionally, your kids have an absolute right to their DNA.  Read the fine print on 23 & me, they own the DNA.  We don't know what the next 100 years will bring in terms of genetics and DNA strands.  Protect your kids.  Your unfounded doubt is no reason to hand their DNA over to third parties."

No offense, but you sound really immature. The fact you can barely control yourself when your partner needs to abstain from sex and are upset that he doesn’t want you to jerk him off into a cup is honestly extremely bizarre. I have genuinely never even heard of someone’s partner assisting in sperm sample collection. That just seems awkward and like it could even contaminate the sample.

Work on self restraint and take a moment to realize that not EVERYTHING has to be done together, especially when he firmly tells you no. You are not entitled to his body. If you want to have a child and healthy marriage, you also need to work on your communication with your husband.

Edit: Your post history shows you have a horrible relationship with your underage stepdaughter to the point you want to move out for the nights when she visits?? This whole situation seems like a recipe for disaster. You need to talk to your husband at the very least, learn about boundaries, and work on maturing."

Edit-to-your-edit: These are all just justifications and excuses for doing what we're telling you (and you must know) is wrong.

Honestly, I was upset when I first found out my boyfriend had one. I felt like it was nicer looking than my parts and maybe even better feeling. It was smooth, never had to be shaved and never had razor burn. It was intimidating and I couldn’t understand why.

My boyfriend was always fine with me using my vibrator during sex, so I felt out of line.
I had to come back to reality. I will always be better than a sex toy. Once I understood this I even used it on him during sex. I believe that we are afraid of things that we don’t understand and things were are not use to. I was fine after that. It’s a toy, it does the same thing as his hand. He still always wants the real thing.

e59jst,YTA for even adding this into your decision of who to let go. Watching your child is not a part of their job description and you should really figure out your own childcare. It's ridiculous to ask a subordinate to babysit for you on the job.
e59ktr,"ESH.  Instagram presents an idealized version of life, a fantasy, this isn't new information.  I would directly confront your mom about this, tell her how uncomfortable you are with the way she portrays the family on Instagram and forces the kids the do stuff.

e59kwx,"This is way above this sub’s paygrade. Your spouse is is depressed and likely in crisis. You leaving won’t make it better, but he’s not TA for suggesting it. He really needs to see someone ASAP. And you need to not take his irrational ideas personally."

I don't blame them from cutting ties with you. They may come around eventually but you probably severed some serious bonds, at least with the older two.

At the very least, it would have been better for your wife to go alone and do a long distance relationship with your wife instead of your kids. This would have worked better if your wife would later be able to transfer back. Or I'd be more understanding if you were on the verge of homelessness. 

No halfway decent parent would chose a dream job over their children. No halfway decent parent should chose a spouse iver their minor children."
e59wi0,"Oh NTA. I often believe that if someone overlooks racism/transphobia/homophobia in terms of people they associate with, then it reflects on their own opinions/beliefs too.

You did right in cutting her out, although, I do advise you give her an explanation. Something simple on the lines of “Hey Anna, I’m sorry but I feel we are no longer on the same page and feel our friendship has ran it’s course. I find (said friends) behaviours unacceptable and cant bring myself to associate with them or anyone else who can willingly accept such toxic behaviours/beliefs.

YTA.

You  insisted on reading his manuscripts and then told him they are utter hot garbage and would rather read the future in the shit-filled diapers of the local dementia ward of the elder care hostel than pick up his work and read it for pleasure.

As a professional writer, I can assure you two things:

If you think your writing is beautiful and godly and ""life's work"" - it sucks.

If you think your partner is a good test audience for your ""life's work"" - you aren't looking for honest feedback, you're looking for delusional support.

You're only the asshole because of the way you handled the situation - in the most crushingly painful way you possibly could have handled it.

Look, my friends and writing partners have had a straight-up agreement: we have a common goal in mind, which is to get honest, useful feedback that we can use to build out our fiction work. It's all practice until one of us gets the best-selling novel - even the stuff that DOES get published.

But I gotta tell you that what you did was quite possibly the one thing I have told everyone in any writing group or any ""new novel writer"" group is the single thing NOT TO EVER DO TO ANYONE YOU JUST MET.

And you did it to your husband.

Let that sink in for a minute.

You did something that I will ban people for life from a writing group and tell them not to let the door hit them in the ass on the way out. You did something that is so completely uncool that just forwarding this to another writer whom I work with in another city said, ""Holy shit, what's this person's name? They sound just like this woman I kicked out last week and told never to come back.""

And you did it TO YOUR HUSBAND.

God, are you EVER the asshole here. Not just mildly so, but on a whole different level.

Unsolicited from you would be just straight up insensitivity.

What you did was the equivalent of demanding to see someone's progress and then saying the whole thing was utter shit and demanding a match and a can of gas so you could burn it all down.

I'm going to tell you right now that if he doesn't divorce your ass, I'd be shocked. That's beyond disrespectful. That's abusive.

By the way, had anyone done something remotely CLOSE to this in a writing group that I mediate, that person would be banned and blacklisted from all local writing groups. It's happened before. What you did is so far off the pale it's not even funny.

I hope that one day you find yourself in this situation, where you offer the core of yourself to someone you love because they insist that you should because you love them so much...

...and they drop it on the ground and proceed to shit on it as thoroughly as you've shit on your husband's.

Damn, you suck.

e5axtb,"YWB-NTA if you're doing it just to get your dad a hoodie from the team he likes. However, YTA because you're doing it with the intent of replacing a gift you didn't deem good enough. Was what your step mom gave him a licensed product? No. But it was made from the heart. Money wasn't an issue, as you said. Sometimes people have trouble shopping for others when money isn't an issue because, what do you get someone who can buy whatever they want? So she did something thoughtful and I'm sure put a lot of time and effort into it. The action isn't the problem on your end, it's the intent behind it. Much like the intent behind her gift two years ago was love."

e5b13g,YTA because he’s literally just trying to be a good partner. If you’re as good friends as you say you should be happy he’s treating his partner well. He didn’t say no he just said he needed to check. That’s the correct response. It’s incredibly disrespectful to make plans on someone else’s behalf and then have that person be the asshole by having to decline later etc. Your birthday is on a popular night. Surely you have accepted by now that you have to kind of let go of the expectations that people will prioritize your birthday over anything else (excluding family and partners of course). I have a similarly popular birthday. It’s hard but honestly saves a lot of disappointment when I just accept that a lot of people will be busy and it doesn’t mean they don’t care about me

e5b3j7,"Hmmm gonna go with NAH. You may be misinterpreting how your sister feels about you. I would assume that she loves you and wants you to be involved in one of the biggest days of her life, not just to be an observer. I wasn’t there, but I think you may have just misread her tone when she asked. At the same time, she needs to recognize that you have physical and mental limits that you cannot necessarily overcome. You two should work out a way for you to be involved in the wedding (not necessarily a part of the bridal party) that is comfortable for you both."
e5b3xj,YTA. Put your stuff away. It's not your dad or brother's job to gently put your things away -- it's your job.

e5b67p,"YTA for trying to parent him. You are doubly the asshole for recommending a pseudoscientific, discredited ""medical"" practice to him.

Nothing she did prevents you from dumping him.  You had the exclusive talk, yet he was dating other girls.  His ""story"" shouldn't matter, you should immediately dump him.

Getting pissed at your friend is only going to hurt you in the long run.  You become the girl that no one wants to tell the truth because you take it out on the wrong person.  

Apologize to your friend."
e5c97b,NTA tbh your dad is at fault if he thinks you’re really that much of a burden on the “SMITH” name then you should change it I guess but I mean try and see if you can work it out before doing anything at least try and seal the bandage before ripping it off

I think people will disagree with me, but personally, if you're comfortable, I don't feel like paying your sister's phone bill is much of an issue.

e5cxzx,"NAH, sure that mom said she's having a 'rough time', but it could be work related or something personal that she may or may not have wanted to discuss with you. I mean if you really wanted to know, you could go out for coffee or lunch with her and casually bring it up in a conversation by saying ""I'm a realtor and my husband does yadayada"" & you can describe how your job is to her. If she doesn't respond with what she does, then just understand she doesn't want you to know and leave that topic.

Also, your husband makes some valid points. If you already have an assistant, wouldn't it be better to give him the extra hours because he'll feel like you don't value him as an employee. If you do give this mom that position without talking to your other assistant and explaining as to WHY you're doing it, then YTA because that's disrespectful to the assistant.

I get you're trying to be a genuinely concerned person but you should talk to your husband and refocus your view."
e5cyq1,"NTA. If they loved you like a grandparent should, they would try to understand. They’re intentionally disrespecting you, and I don’t blame you one bit for not wanting to associate with them."
e5czjv,"NTA.

My wife and I had an open relationship, and despite my mom being ""moderately socially liberal,"" I still didn't think she'd fly with the whole thing so I lied about it constantly. Never once did I come out to her about it.

Given how off the rails she went about other (far more benign) things, I feel 1000% correct in my decision to do so. I wouldn't change a thing.

Fact is: Your lifestyle (and the labels that accompany it) are yours. You get to decide who to share them with, to what extent, etc. Clearly, after the first blowup, you knew that your mom wasn't as chillaxed as you; your peace of mind comes first, so you absolutely can and should choose how much to divulge/withhold.

Your mom needs to grow up; my mom did too. When you're gone and living your life (with all the people who make you happy and accept you), maybe she will; in the meantime, divulge details on a need-to-know basis and keep her in the dark lest you're willing to forfeit peace-of-mind."

It can be considered insulting to a chef, to add salt or pepper to a dish, without tasting it first.  How could you possibly know it needs seasoning without trying it first?

Similar idea with trying the vegetarian chili.

You weren't trying the vegetarian chili, you made your own concoction with the vegetarian chili as an ingredient.

One possible reason she could have taken offence, would be: you aren't giving vegetarian food a chance, if you have to add meat to it, before you give it a try.

It is one thing to say - ""Hey that looks good, can I try some?"" Try it, and find it less appetizing than you expected - then fix it.

It is an entirely different scenario to ask for it, then tell the very person who made it - it is unacceptable unless the forbidden fruit is added.

Not EXACTLY what you did, but kind of is."
e5d5v8,"YTA.  You took another persons stuff and just threw it away because it was negatively affecting you.  You mention you are selling your home and use this as a justification saying essentially that this was lowering your home value.  How do you think that that gives you the right to throw away someone else's belongings. 

&#x200B;

 A crappy car in someone else's home can negatively effect home prices for everyone in the neighborhood, do you think it would be appropriate for me to call a tow truck and have a neighbors car towed because I'm trying to sell my home?

&#x200B;

If you did that I'm pretty sure you and everyone else would acknowledge that you are the asshole?  What makes this situation different?  Is it because this guy is homeless?  If so you are essentially saying it is OK to harm people as long as they are defenseless."
e5d69q,"NTA - Address this immediately. Those excuses are practically triggering a PTSD episode on my end. They seem to think they have the upper hand in this situation by outnumbering you in how you feel about it vs. how they feel about it — **when how they feel about it is flat out inconsiderate, unfair and disgusting.** I went through the **exact same fucking thing** of two new roommates of mine befriending one another, both turning out to be slobs — and trying to gaslight ME in thinking I’M in the wrong for expecting basic sanitary living conditions for a shared space. When I think back to how infuriating this really was, my emotions about it still come out lol.

Thankfully in your situation it seems as though you have a third party who will handle it formally. In my instance, I only had a landlord who didn’t intervene or give a shit about anything other than collecting rent. It led to me having to leave notes, get in to screaming matches with them out of frustration, and eventually begin to send disgusting photos of their mess *(with flash on)* to them in group texts CONSTANTLY to annoy the fuck out of them, and leave their piles of dirty dishes in front of their bedroom doorways so that I could use the sink that I’m also entitled to.

Best of luck."

e5dc9j,"As someone who used to be super thin I can confirm that people make these kind of comments all the time. It's considered rude to comment on someone's body when they're fat, but perfectly normal when they are skinny - this is exactly what you have experienced here, the double standard. I can also confirm that it is definitely damaging to your self image as a skinny girl to constantly hear these kinds of things. Being too thin can be extremely unhealthy. When you identify as the skinny girl you often deliberately make choices to keep you skinny, because that's who you are. Like only eating half your meals, only choosing healthy food etc. Most of the time the people affected don't necessarily realise what they're doing. Some people take it too far and they become anorexic or bulimic. I have 2 sisters who have battled with eating disorders because of it. One is so bad she has ruined her teeth from vomiting (bulimic) and has to get regular IV nutrients just to stay alive. 

I realise you were standing up for your girl, and kudos to you for that. If you had omitted the word fat from your insult I'd be all for you, but knowing how bad body image issues are for so many people I have to say ESH. She shouldn't say what she said, but likely doesn't realise the impact of her statements. But on that same token, it's never ok to use language that makes someone feel bad about their body - fat or thin."

Gently tell him his son may not stay in the main house, but he's welcome to add a bed for his son in his own room.  At this stage of the divorce, there's a decent chance that will be acceptable as an interim living situation in the court's view, although he may need to find a real two bedroom apartment in the future.

You should absolutely be able to have your own stuff but it looks like you're going to have to hide it better.

e5glyz,"NTA. She was forewarned about you staying up late and you also agreed to adjust brightness/sound if it bothered her. She agreed. If she’s getting pissed off now, telling anyone other than you is exactly why the problem isn’t being resolved. I’m not sure if there might be more to it from her point of view but to me it seems like you should casually bring it up, just ask if it’s okay you still being on the computer late now that she’s getting into an earlier routine.  

Now that she’s getting up earlier it’s possible that she could be hoping to go to sleep earlier, too, but is pissed off that you hadn’t thought of that yourself so that she didn’t have to ask you to finish up earlier."

e5in15,"I’m gonna go against the grain here and say NTA. It sounds like OP has talked to husband and he has been unresponsive, instead turning it around on her, saying “why would you be upset I’m helping someone else?” when in fact he’s NOT helping someone else. He’s forcing HER to help someone else, when she already has a lot on her plate. 

Additionally, what OP has described doesn’t sound like “whining” to me. It sounds like someone who is pointedly communicating their needs more effectively, telling DH that they are overwhelmed and need help when they do. And DH’s response to this is to accuse her of whining, when his real complaint is that more is being expected of him and he doesn’t like it. Just because husband calls it whining, doesn’t mean it is. 

I’m really disappointed that people are telling OP they need to go back to being a doormat in order to save their marriage. OP, if your husband only wants you as a doormat and doesn’t respect your time, your health, or your feelings, is it really your responsibility to make him happy and salvage the relationship? It sounds like you both need to have a hardcore conversation about both your needs and come up with a compromise. 

And yes, he may have been this way all along and OP was fine being the doormat in the beginning of the relationship, when they were most likely younger, had less going on, were basking in the light of the honeymoon phase. But as the years go by, marriage gets harder, people learn and grow up and realize their needs are important to their mental health. 

OP - it doesn’t sound like you’re whining to me. Husband needs to step up his spouse game and listen to your concerns without turning them against you and gaslighting the conversation to make you feel like asking for your needs to be met is wrong."

Control them, do not let the kids use them at 2 in the morning, make safe decisions about their internet use.. 

But if you decide your children's relationship with their father is somehow something you can legislate, if he isn't being abusive, just because of how the court decided the custody, you will be SHOCKED when you realize that your children don't CARE what you think, and want a relationship with their father. 

As it turns out, whether the ex-wife likes it or  not, the father is still the father, and attempts to actively work against him having a relationship with his children WILL backfire. 

(note: I am the ex-wife and Mom, and this is my approach to my child's relationship with his father, that relationship is  important even if my relationship with the man didn't last)."

Keep up the good work and tell that player if they don’t like the way you DM, show them the door.

Your wife is not a child. This is not about what you allow or don't allow. Your wife should have free rein to make whatever choices she wishes to make. Giving her ultimatums or commands about how should relate to Jenny is controlling behavior.

You are, however, correct that it would be best if your wife never talks to Jenny again. Why? because this relationship puts your marriage at risk. If your wife values your marriage, she should stop having anything to do with Jenny.

So, what should you do?

e5lcxy,"YTA. I understand getting frustrated but that was completely uncalled for. She is scared, frustrated, and hormonal. Have some empathy! 

A better response would have been ""I know you're upset and probably scared and I want to help you but I can't if you don't let me. Having an unsafe abortion is completely unnecessary. You could die! If accepting the money is the problem, then you can pay me back for the procedure when you have the money. Call the clinic, book an appointment and I'll go with you so you're not alone. You said you want an abortion, so this is how it's going to get done.""

Yes, she's being irrational and understandably making you angry because of it. Your anger is justified. How you decided to respond and react is not justified. You cannot control how you feel, but you can control how you react to it."
e5ldhp,"NAH

But I would suggest you broach this subject very lightly since it is a very sentimental thing. I mean you could say that you would rather have your wedding band be a simple one that you wear day to day and save the meaningful one for special occasions. I mean idk what you do professionally and as hobbies, but I’m and outdoorsy type. My wife and I have both lost or broken multiple wedding bands (none were sentimental or super pricey for this reason). She’s on ring #3 and I’m on #2. Hell one ring, she was driving home one day from work with her windows down and her arm dangling out, it was a little chilly but still nice, fingers get a pinch smaller when cold, and her ring just fell off into a grown over ditch (we live in the boonies). I imagine your fiancé would be crushed if you lost the heirloom with something silly like that."

I’m guessing if the books have personal meaning then they’re good ones and so reach out

 “I’m sorry for your loss, I know I didn’t know your daughter well but I’m glad that I managed to share my love of (insert author) with her before she passed. There’s one particular quote from a book I lent which really resonated with me so I wanted to share this with you (insert quote).

It's also worth considering reporting him to the police if he's like this , as verbal and emotional abuse is still abuse. Take recordings if you can to use as evidence, should you need it.

She may be planning for a time in which she may be financially dependent on her son. It is a bit old fashioned, not unreasonable.

She may want to plan ahead for the quite probable future in which her son has children and might just want to make sure that if he does pass that the kids are looked after. Again, old fashioned but not a bad thing.

A serious muscle injury will take a lot longer to heal than a broken bone. The muscle cannot be immobilised for a length of time like a bone can. 

Doing a simple chore like washing some dishes can very easily aggravate the injury, and cause the muscle to swell, resulting in pain. 

I have a muscle injury - my lower back on the left side. It’s been two and a half years and I’m only about half way through a recovery. 

Your roommates injury will heal, but it will likely take a lot longer than three months. I’d expect a full recovery in around 12 months. 

If he’s able to do a chore with one hand, then he can do that. He can put clothes into the washing machine and turn it on. He can take the clothes out and put them in the dryer.
He can scrub the toilet bowl with one arm, and he can put away dishes with one arm. 

But don’t push him to do chores that in all likelihood will just aggravate his injury and cause him pain.

Edit: According to what I’ve read, it will take up to six weeks for the labrum to reattach itself to the bone, and another six weeks to strengthen. After that, you have to be very careful not to stress the injury - being so recently healed means there’s a higher risk of reinjury."

Your teacher is right... but - 

**You don't understand what your teacher is doing. I can't fault you for that.**

You will end up in this situation in life.

There are things she can help with. If you stick with that mindset of you're the only one who can do things you will have a rude awakening when you get out there in the real world.

There are many people better and smarter than you.

There will be a day when you are the deadweight.

This is a problem I deal with in managing people - this is the solution: [comparitive advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp)

I know I can do things better than a lot of people on my team. Probably about 20 out of 25 of them ... but, I don't have the time to do the work of a team of 25 software engineers - I need to delegate. So, comparative advantage is the solution.

How do you apply comparitive advantage in this situation? You need to look at her as a resource. What can she do that she won't screw up - and will save you time to focus on the harder stuff. She will contribute, you will save some time, you can do more important things.

Resources? That means people. People are a resource. You are a resource, she is a resource. Your time is a resource. Use your resources efficiently and to the maximum of their potential.

Last, and maybe the most important- let her know you are putting your trust in her to do her part. You're counting on her to contribute. As long as you both do your part, you both get that good grade.

Trust motivates. (Of course, trust but verify. Never trust blindly.)

Do it. You have no idea how valuable what you will learn is if you pull this off. This is leadership. This is infinitely valuable.

**TL;DR: Be a leader. Help a person. You both will win.**

I’m in the same situation. Poly addicted brother who won’t get medical help, rehab or counseling for his addiction and mental illness. Mother enables him and gets heartbroken every time she thinks he’s gonna change. Heck my sister is going through this very same thing with her son the last 3 years and she can only empathize with my mother (her step mother), though she is trying a different approach she’s still making mistakes. Her son stole and wrecked her car after letting him back in her home after having kicked him out nearly a year.

Your brother sucks obviously.

Your mother sucks because she is effecting your life with something you really don’t want to be a part of. She sucks for enabling him but in her shoes she’s really trying to help him. But it’s hard to help when she’s being manipulated. 

You suck for basically telling her to give up and get over it. You have kids. You might say you’d do better... 

Though in my family the fathers try as little to be involved as possible while the mothers really want to fix their children and have them at least safe and know where they are and if they’re okay. I’m not saying you’d be one of these fathers but please don’t be one of these fathers if this ever happens to your future adult kids. 

It’s fair that you want to live your own life free of this drama, you have every right to, but as long as your brother doesn’t get the help he needs, your mother will never stop being effected by it. When your kids grow up they dont stop being your kids. One of her kids is very sick and fucked up and suffering with medical problems (addiction is a medical problem). Shes allowed to get upset.

Secondly, they could overdraft the account easily and that will hit your husband. If they overdraft it the bank comes for him and not the family. The same applies to the credit card.

I understand his desire to help his family. But he is putting himself and you at a great risk since his family is not good with money.

I also don't think it would have gone over well to march up to her and say ""you're too much of a burden on me right now, let's stop hanging out"". Adults often phase each other out and scale back on social interactions without needing to make declarations about it.

“A landlord cannot enter the accommodation unannounced. He or she is obliged to first knock or ring the doorbell, and wait until the door is opened.
A landlord is not allowed to visit the tenant at any given time. When the landlord wants to visit the accommodation, he or she needs to have clear and well-formulated reasons to do so.” 
Technically, what the land lady did seems to have been a violation of the law. While her intent may have been great in her own mind, I can completely understand how what may seem sweet to her would have had you running for the hills. The landlady was not your mother and had no right (as far as I can tell-if I’m wrong please correct me) to be in that apartment without your knowledge.

I very much understand where your parents are coming from: they're scared. Coming out as trans inevitably means a swath of challenges for your family, and feeling apprehensive about the runoff of those challenges is normal. Maybe even expected.

What they are overlooking, though, is how difficult it is to be closeted. It's far worse when you're trans, as far as I understand, because (and correct me if I'm wrong, naturally) you're confronted every day by well-meaning people who are using a name and pronoun you don't want, and you are constantly reminded that you're not living as yourself. Your parents' role right now is to protect and support all three of their children, and ideally that would mean finding a way to work together as a family to support your decision to come out and prepare your brothers for what might happen.

Be aware, though, that coming out will present challenges for you, too. The school may not be supportive (I'm not sure how well-protected you are in your area, so I can't really say), and you will want to be very ready before you take any steps. Make sure you're safe."

But not in the way you think.

You should have stopped the destruction in the first place. Allowing your friends to vandalize makes you complicit of the act. Who your friends are reflects on you. They are shits, which means you are shit.

Do you know why the school ""forgave you?"" Because it would have looked horrible if their valedictorian didn't graduate. If you weren't their top student, you wouldn't have been given this chance.

The only reason you care about what happened is because you were about to lose your ""honor.""

Truth is the world may thing you have honor, but you don't. Not because you ratted your friends out, but because you stood by and watched and did nothing. You only did something when you were threatened.

Pure speculation here, just my thoughts -

1. Your bf might be burned out from serving and want downtime in the evening. Or if he works at night he can't socialize the same way as folks with a 9-5.

2. Your bf might be struggling with depression or anxiety and isolating himself.

3. You want to expand his social circle?  Wonderful intention, but you can't force a friendship. You can say, ""Let's hang out with x and y people for a movie or game night."" and see how it goes.  (Something close ended.)  

4.  If he's being clingy, I would want to know - he's being controlling? Is he preventing you from seeing other friends?  If so, please carefully evaluate if this is healthy.  

If he sees you as good company, okay, but lay some boundaries. Make sure you take time with your friends / family."

Bringing up your niece sounds a bit hollow -- were you and your wife setting aside any money for you niece? Saving to help with her college or emergency expenses? Unless you were contributing financially to her upbringing I don't think you get to judge how her parents handle it.

Of course, it would be nice of him to do, that doesn't mean he's obligated to.

From what I'm hearing it sounds as though you aren't able to live freely in your own home because of your dad's temper. Regardless of whether your father is to blame, this is an awful situation to be in. It makes a lot of sense to me that you'd feel angry about that.

Brain stuff is complicated. I know that a lot of people who have Traumatic Brain Injuries, for example, experience difficulty regulating their emotions. So it isn't totally surprising that someone who has part of their brain removed would find it tough to remain calm when things don't go exactly the way they are envisioning, and it isn't clear to what extent your dad has any control over that. At least in theory and depending on what else is going on, your dad should still be capable of apologizing and acknowledging that things got out of hand, but these things vary person to person.

You are NTA/NAH (depending) for being angry at your dad. He isn't able to be there for you in the way you need him to be, his illness takes up a lot of space in your life, and it sounds like you aren't getting the chance to just be a kid and make mistakes and have fun. That doesn't necessarily mean you should act on that anger -- like yelling at him or telling him all the things on your mind -- but it's always okay to feel what you feel.

You have no idea if you are getting an inheritance and want to borrow against it, while the giver is still living?

There are plenty of domestic violence agencies that would help your gf. She needs to reach out to social services and explain the situation. Services are not just financial but can help her get counseling, even if it's just a social worker to talk to. She might qualify for a relocation grant to help her move into an apartment, as a one time only gift.

I'm sure our intentions toward her are good, but I'd never advise someone escaping a domestic violence situation to immediately move in with their new relationship. She's young and needs to discover herself and develop some independence, and a caseworker will probably be able to counsel her on that."
e6cyf7,YTA. If she specifically asked for it wouldn’t she kinda already know what she was getting since she asked for it for Christmas?

Once you guys know whether you're going to keep seeing each other, you could tell him you started listening to that music because you saw that he was interested and it piqued your interest.

Companies who ask employees not to discuss compensation are the AH - they are actively trying to prevent employees from understanding the compensation structure. If they have valid reasons for you getting less than others, then they should be transparent enough to discuss that with you openly.

A fucking judge ruled you would be responsible for her death. You don’t care though; her life doesn’t mean much in comparison to the dogs. That much is clear. Not only that, but you’re forcing your S/O into a fucking hotel every other weekend (don’t even get me started on the financial aspect) and you’ve considered moving out before you’ve considered giving up the dogs, so I guess you don’t care about your relationship either. I feel sorry for your baby; god help them if you ever have to choose between them or the dogs.

Edit: didn’t know about the stepdaughter being hidden when this was first posted. That definitely makes this a far more sticky situation than it appeared at first. Undecided about whether or not the OP is actually the asshole.

Edit 2; I’m going to go with YTA still. Unexpected or not, step or otherwise, a kid is a kid is a kid. And that kid will be in your life forever, regardless of biological relation. If your biological kid were to develop an allergy, what would you do then? What if it was yourself? Your S/O? It’s unfortunate, truly, that you have to give this up your dogs for the child but that kids life should still mean more than whether or not you keep the dogs. At the very least, shop the dogs around. TRY to find them a good home. If you try and fail, that’s a different story but if you don’t try you are definitely the asshole."

First off, yes your hubsand is an asshole for blowing up at you. Thats a mountain out of mole hill reaction but lets deep dive into his thoughts. Way I see it couple things are going on, one or all could be true 1) He thinks women should only wear ""appropriate"" clothing outside. I agree thats a controlling dick move, assuming you don't live in a place where you get arrested or anything. 

2) he is legitimately afraid for you cause he believes men are monsters and if they look up and see your nether regions it may alert the monsters to your presence. This is kinda shitty to put the burden upon you but at the end of the day its the monsters he is afraid of

3) he asked you to do a thing and you just ignored it and never expressed why you felt that thing was a bad ask. This would upset anyone and doesn't matter what. If you asked me to refer to you as Karen and I refused and called you Melissa that would upset you/anyone. 

So to me the real issue is you relying on your **inner** feminist an dnot your **outer** feminist i.e. you and hubs should discuss what the actual issue is so y'all can atleast know what the issue is. I think if men vocalized their problems they would better be able to process them and see how silly they are. Cause if he thinks guys might get a quick lookise well...thats rather insane isn't it? But doubt he has ever faced the  reality of saying this fear outloud."

e6k8e7,"NTA. His comment at the end just shows how awful he is. If he asked you to venmo him for your ice cream, just ask him to venmo him for everything you bought for him."
e6k8is,[deleted]
e6k8zh,"NTA. Dude, you need to get out of there like yesterday for your own mental health. Do whatever it takes, you come first in your life."
e6kap9,NTA. Technically the books are NOT still hers. Hindsight's 20/20 but that doesn't mean her friend gets the books.
e6kcbt,"NTA.

You didn't say 'Hey Prof. Please fuck my friend over.' or mention anything about your friend at all actually. You asked for your test to be relooked at and then the teacher realised his mistake.

Fuck all to do with you."
e6kchp,"Considering you said you’re a woman and this is like your sister, NTA.

This is someone you were close to for a number of years and if your brother isn’t uncomfortable with you being friends then I don’t see why he can’t disconnect from the fact that they were together. She should just be considered your friend and not your bros ex at this point.

If you would buy any of your friends a plane ticket or lend any of your good friends money, then that’s who you are as a person. It shouldn’t matter what your brother thinks."
e6kdk2,"NTA. It sucks sometimes but you can’t let bad partners ruin your grade for you for the sake of appearing nice.  Your teacher told you to boot them too. As long as you handled it graciously, I think you are fine here."
e6kgwp,"YTA

If it’s so close drive yourself. The tip is for the convenience they offer you."
e6kha3,"NTA You are all taking the class and she's distracting you by making comments about how gross things are, thus making it her business. You brought it up as a joke, but were making a valid point. If you want to have a job in emergency medicine, you should be ok with the sight of blood."
e6khsm,NAH- you *should* be honest with your friend. If it’s been 2 years already and she still cries over it every day- she prob needs some sort of professional help- therapist maybe. Friends unloading on us can be draining- which is why a therapist would be great- she can unload on them and get some professional advice at the same time.
e6klgh,NTA. FIL needs to keep his opinions about your body to himself.
e6kn9n,"YTA only because he’s fucking one, of course things confuse him. How else do you learn besides exposure and practice of confusing shit? Children are sponges and the more you expose them to the more they take in. Worst case scenario he doesn’t pick up on please and thank you, best case he does there is no harm in trying."
e6kpyh,"NTA, she's not a child, old people don't suddenly loose all sense of right and wrong unless they are really ill. Start talking back or you are gonna be a rug, and same with her children. You don't have to just take it."
e6kui5,"YTA, this this no different than a noise complaint. Your recreational activities are disturbing your neighbors. They shouldn't have to breath your second hand smoke just because you don't want to leave the building to get your nicotine fix."
e6kujv,"NTA. Imagine being so selfish that you could still enjoy a trip *knowing your presence is a huge imposition.* 

Your husband needs to push back, tell her to change the ticket, and impress upon her that it is **not cool** to plan stuff like this without asking first."
e6kv8t,NTA- she sounds hella flakey.
e6kvfg,"Sorry, but I think YTA in general. You aren’t thinking of your child at all in this situation. Divorce is hard on them and it would be nice if you all could be cordial adults for a Christmas gathering. I would hope your girlfriend could understand that it is one day where you can show your kid that they are loved by their family and that everyone can get along."
e6kwnk,"NTA

I think you probably need to do this incrementally.

Take him aside and let him know he's violating the spirit of the group when he uses dead names and inquires about sexuality in a personal way outside of group.

Let him know these actions aren't appreciated and if he continues behaviors like this he won't be welcome back."
e6l1d5,"NTA. From each according to their ability, to each according to their need, comrade!"
e6l3cx,NTA- there’s this cool theft powder that turns purple when you touch it. It reacts to moisture if I remember correctly. I would dust the bag with that and catch them purple handed.
e6lb2o,"YTA. 
Why’d you take the job in the first place? They’re being friendly to you and you’re gonna walk out just because you don’t have anything to do? 
Why don’t you talk to your friendly boss and stop ignoring him. That’s no way to act in a professional setting. Especially if you are really considering quitting."
e6lcff,NTA at all. This is not up to your FIL and you’ve made a really fair request.
e6lee2,"NTA but if you want to avoid this I future, I would suggest each paying $10 a month or something though to cover shared expenses like dish soap, toothpaste, toilet paper etc. That way all those really basic things won’t become an issue when it comes to sharing. Your roomate is in the wrong here though and toothpaste or not, it’s not right to take your stuff without asking."
e6lktx,"NTA, but what would you do if they refuse? I would seriously think about finding a new roommate."
e6lm2h,"NTA

You have a lot going on and it is perfectly reasonable to stay home and relax. It's not like you're stopping him from going."
e6lo82,"NTA. It's great that your parents have done so much for her, more than a lot of people would, but ultimately she's not their responsibility. At 18 she's an adult and it's time she started to think about looking after herself. It sounds to me like they're good people and as such they deserve to enjoy their twilight years."
e6loav,NTA Never ever put a shit minimum wage job before spending time with family. This is why materialism causes so much suffering.
e6lqoi,"NAH - No one is an asshole here, but her logic doesn't make sense even if the portfolio doesn't get her a better job, it will certainly put her in a position where companies are more willing to take a chance on someone without the normal expected level of experience."
e6ls1d,NTA. I have the same experience with my family and they also use the same excuse when i use bible quote against them. I think making your mother cry is unfortunate but you were just standing up for your own conviction so it's not really your fault. Apologize for making her cry but don't apologize for standing up for yourself.
e6lury,"NTA

Going out to eat is for you to take some time away from your desk /work and literally take a break. When you are responsible for ordering food for them, it takes away from your break time and it makes you responsible for their food. 

I wouldn't mind doing it every once in a while, but not all the time."
e6lvbe,"Going against the grain here with NTA .  And here’s why. Your mother did nothing while your SD abused you for years. He pushed her 3 year old grand child, and she did nothing. So on the off chance she talks him into letting her spend time alone with you and your family, can you ever really trust her to protect your child in her care?

Until she can really talk this out with you and recognize the abuse she has enabled, she isn’t a safe person for your child to be around. Your mother needs a divorce and counseling, but the odds of this happening are slim. Perhaps your ultimatum will be a wake up call for her. But until she can truly break free, your priority needs to be your child, not her or your SD’s hurt feelings.

Edit: misspelled word"
e6m1mf,NTA - sometimes you grow up and grow apart. i don’t think you would be an asshole whether or not you sent her a happy bday message but she might appreciate the thought
e6m2fc,"YTA. He’ll probably just think it’s cool and edgy and the point will be lost, plus now he’s got another lighter."
e6m52j,"NTA 

You’re paying the bill aren’t you? If you pay the bill you get a say period. I’d move out tbh because that sounds ridiculous and controlling. 

I’m pretty sure if they can pay the extra oil bill they can pay someone to shovel their driveway too."
e6m5wq,"NTA-. Joining in on a protest about something that you aren't protesting would be a more asshole move.  

 If you wanted to go with them to show support I'd make it clear that you aren't against the decorations, but feel that everyone should be heard.  But either way, they ( the Jewish girls) have put you in a tough spot and singled you out."
e6m8jl,"*Whaaaa ?* Why would he want to get a vasectomy reversed if not to have more kids? The, ""I feel less masculine"" excuse doesn't fly and has no basis in fact.

e6mat7,"YWBTA 

Right motivation, wrong execution

You're really not in a position to do anything with that intervention but piss her off. You would need to get someone involved who has some professional ability to help her and authority to demand she accept the help or face the consequences.

Your heart is the right place but you really don't have anything to actually provide her with."
e6mb6q,"NTA

RED FLAG! Dating a month, asking you 5x a day to see you, showing up *uninvited* when you need to leave for work? 

Run! That is really overwhelming and definitely not something you should ignore. He is not listening to you, he is acting way too possessive.

Nothing about this seems ok. Listen to yourself and dump him."
e6mkn5,"NAH (Wife or sister, boyfriend=asshole)

Don't invite him, but be prepared for the fact your SIL probably won't attend. And from the sounds of it, she will involve as many people as possible."
e6mlxy,"NTA, this is so bizarre. 3.5 is WAY too old to be breastfeeding, and if it’s to the point where he’s pulling practical stranger’s shirts down, there needs to be an end."
e6mm2e,"NTA.  I finally started doing things as well to a friend. 
I put up my hand and say ‘hold on, I wasn’t done yet’. Kinda awkward but just remember, she deserves it. It’s beyond rude 
My favorite is if she does it on the phone. I just start saying ‘hello? Can you hear me?  Oh ok cause I was talking and thought maybe you couldn’t hear since you interrupted’ lol"
e6mr4i,"NAH - the idea that it’s rude to discuss salaries only benefits employers. 

Anyhow, it’s a valid question and he gave a valid answer. 

I’m a professional artist and as a community we often discuss how much we make off of a work or a show. It helps us know what’s “reasonable” for art prices, and know which clients will try to get work on the cheap."
e6msog,"NTA, not your dog, not your responsibility but it sounds like you’re trying but your dad isn’t backing you up. If you can’t take care of the dog and you’re it’s primary caregiver, talk to your mom about rehoming it or at least get your dad to take up some responsibility regarding his dog. Your list of chores sounds extensive, especially if your siblings aren’t pitching in. You’re the eldest, doesn’t mean you’re the maid. Your siblings are old enough to do some chores and help around the house."
e6muho,"YTA

Gift giving is not about expecting reciprocation. It is about showing how you feel about the other person.

Learn to accept gifts graciously and to show thanks. Do not deny the gift giver their opportunity to express their love for you.

Also, don't stress out about match gift financially. Give based on what you can do. Good people will appreciate it. What matters is that you thought of them and got them something."
e6mwxh,"NTA. Play bitch games win bitch prizes. Do it anonymously and leave it to the profs to decide if they can tell of they cheated. It's law school not highschool. Cheating has consequences. This happened all the time when I was in engineering school. People got reported and they deserved it. If you do cheat and aren't smart enough to make it look like you didn't then you doubly don't belong there.

Edit. There's a lot of ""you have the wrong motivations"" in these comments. Motivations be damned. This is a social lesson about giving people a reason to turn you in. A lot of cops will let you get away with speeding 5mph, but if you flipped them off when you passed them they wouldn't. Learn not to give people a reason..."
e6mz7v,"NAH. There’s different levels of kosher. Can he just order a vegetarian meal where you go? That’s usually kosher by default if you’re basic kosher like no meat and milk in the same meal. If he’s requiring a place keep a kosher kitchen then that’s kind of unreasonable. 

Also there’s no reason he can’t join you and drink seltzer and cranberry on Friday. Maybe ask him what he suggests? He hasn’t crossed the line into being an asshole. He’s been kosher for ages and knows that sometimes it limits your options like a vegan person would. If he hasn’t asked you to stop or god forbid accuse you of being anti Semitic, he can feel a little lonely without being an ass. Also most places will sit one extra person who brings a bag lunch if there’s a whole crew of people. If there’s at least 6 of you and one person says they can’t eat there but wants to join, the restaurant would be an ass for not allowing that, especially if they can’t accommodate that person’s dietary needs. It’s not like he’s going in alone wanting a table."
e6n4fb,"> because M really likes him

e6n4l9,"I'm going to say NAH - we don't know her situation, it might be that she is homeless and that is the safest place for her to sleep."
e6n6rb,"NTA. I agree with Dad. Why can't your mom or your sister's baby daddy be the chauffeur? You work and have classes, what makes them think you have all the time in the world to play limo driver? Kinda sounds like you got voluntold but didn't want to put up a stink about it so you just did it to make everyone happy."
e6n8ca,"> Maybe our mistake was in telling people our plans to elope.

Facepalm. Apparently you and I have VERY different dictionary definitions of the word ""elope"" because the fundamental key to it is the secrecy. NTA, but you kind of opened yourself up to criticism on this one."

Don’t share meds like that, you’re smart not to. Your mom should go to the doctor and get herself checked out and get meds prescribed by a doctor for HER."
e6neql,"You're asking a depressed person to be friends on your terms, by giving them tasks that not only seem impossible, but add to the overall stress of the illness. Do some research and maybe find out what your friend *actually* needs. I'd rather claw my face off than go out with friends during a depressive episode, but it's also very hard to say no to the invitation because you're afraid your friends will abandon you. Like you did.

Yeah. YTA."

Your roommate is upset because of the ongoing issues with your cleanliness. It's crazy that you said it would be a surprise to your roommate just to do some dishes. These are little things that you should be doing all the time to keep up with the house, doing dishes isn't some big event. Living in a home with your constant mess has got to be frustrating to her. 

Your solution of calling a cleaning company is a bit insulting. Like instead of just picking up after yourself a little bit you're calling some service to come by so that they can clean the place and you can go right back to fucking it up again. Your roommate just wants you to do your part, and that involves actually putting effort in rather than having someone else do it for you. 

The fact that you called a service shows your roommate that you're not willing to change your messy behavior and that is frustrating. She's been communicative with you, and if she plainly said she needs some space you should just respect that."
e6ngt1,NTA- 8k is nothing to lose compared to tying yourself to a house with someone who is clearly not ready to commit to you. Walk away girl!

If he finds out you're not married and he makes a thing of it, he's TA for sure. But he hasn't done that; you're only speculating. There's no need to worry yourself over shit that may never happen. 

Right now, it sounds like both of y'all are just living your lives. He may have been having a bad day that time his face fell when he saw you. Or he may have felt intimidated cuz he likes you. Either way NAH."

e6o4vc,NTA.  I also had an abusive father although not has severe as your situation. I have tried to bond with him and he doesn’t seem to care but loves my siblings. I’ve decided that if my siblings were to come to me if my dad was sick etc I’d say sorry to hear that and have them deal with it.

See, you were polite and direct. Autistic people like direct because we can't take a hint. It doesn't sound like he was upset by the situation at all.

You:

1. Were speeding and lost your license as a result of that. 

2. Caused your parents’ car to be impounded and *they* had to pay to get it back. 

3. Decided to ignore the terms of your suspension and drive anyway, which could get you thrown in jail. 

4. Bought a new car, when that money should have gone to your parents to cover the cost of your mistakes. 

5. Are driving with no insurance. 

6. Yelled at your parents who are rightfully concerned and angry about the entire situation. 

I’ve never seen a more clear YTA post here. You are acting incredibly irresponsibly. You were (still are) driving dangerously. You’re exposing your family to financial and legal risks. You’re 21 and old enough to know better. Grow up, stop breaking the law, pay your parents back, and stop being such an asshole."

e6rin9,NTA. But uhhhh... do you need a niece? I’m very friendly and communicative.
e6rj1w,"NTA.  She made out with your girlfriend and is pissed at you for talking about it?  If she wanted her private life to stay private, she should have kept it so.  I get that she might have been confused and being outed before she was ready was probably difficult, but that's not your fault.  

Did she ever even apologize to you for what she did?"
e6rkjt,NTA- I don't think I even would have went to see her... I had to re-read ot a few times because she sounds like she is trying to be your mother... Is she normally such a r/nicegirl?
e6rkuv,YTA you know that shit is probably illegal
e6rkwz,"My goodness, *major* NTA. Of course you weren't asking for advice when you were literally telling him good news."
e6rw3w,NTA. Your sister sounds ridiculously selfish and self-centered. Stop showing her things you want for yourself.
e6rx82,ESH. You were also disturbing the peace and possibly making patrons other than the parents and their children uncomfortable.
e6s03k,NTA but alert her bank and possibly the police to come have a chat with her about internet scams. And maybe let Grandpa know not to give her anymore money
e6s087,"NTA. Once a gift is given, the recipient gets to do whatever they want with it."
e6s2qx,ESH.  Your dad doesn't get out of helping pay for his kids because he makes less or spends so much on alcohol.  Your mom is spending her money on weed and alcohol instead of making sure her kids have what they need.  Perhaps the weed and alcohol explain why she's not working as many hours.
e6s5io,"NTA x 1000

It is NEVER their place to use food as punishment.  You should go to the media about this - this can never be allowed to happen to your son or another child again.  For all you know, this COULD be common practice, and this is simply the first time anyone found out about it.  

You know what kind of nonsense goes on in schools.  Give 'em hell!"
e6s7co,"NTA, as a musician I can tell you it’s common curtesy to either put in a mute or turn of electric instruments after 10.  Just because we’re nocturnal doesn’t mean we’re allowed to play if it means other people can’t sleep"
e6s7g1,"NAH, but I understand how someone not versed in medical lingo could be taken aback. The ""asshole"" here is the hospital, and I suggest bringing up the optics of how that particular diagnosis can come across when read aloud to patients. Perhaps there can be checks in place to describe the diagnosis differently or contextualize it. Anyway, you were just doing your job - it would in fact have been unprofessional and inappropriate to omit it and not do a standard discharge."
e6s9cl,"NTA, always rearrange on graph paper and cut out sections for furniture first do that all day then move the real stuff once. Or else you end up like this. I mean how many times did you guys have to rearrange it in 2 hours before he was still unhappy?"
e6sbtp,"NTA. Once a gift is given, that’s it. Your friend doesn’t get to come back and put conditions on the gift later on."
e6sc9s,"NAH. I have friends where joking hard with each other is the norm, and sometimes a joke can rub someone the wrong way without you knowing it until it is said. Y'all handled it like adults. Maybe just avoid that line of joking in the future."
e6sdgy,"NTA at all!!!
Your parents sound dreadful. If you don’t have a lot of experience telling them no, start by eliminating your excuses/explanations. It doesn’t matter if your car is in the shop. 
“Oh, I’m so sorry but I can’t”
“Oh no, I’m unavailable”
“I think you might want to look for another sitter” 

Repeat a million times, in a friendly voice. I’m only suggesting the friendly voice because it sounds like telling them no is new for you and sometimes it’s easier to ease in to it. Good luck!"
e6sik9,NAH your health is just as important as his. tell his landlord about the bedbugs and only go over to visit him in designated bed bug clothes. it's not his fault he has bedbugs tho.
e6sonw,"NTA - and it may be worth it to take her to court for everything. This would be a great episode of Judge Judy. 

Also I’d say it’s safe to say her friendship isn’t worth it."
e6spfz,"NTA.

She said you were making your wedding all about you? Umm, that's the point, that day is supposed to be all about your and your partner.

It sounds like even if you invite her, she probably won't be able to come, so I don't see the harm in sending her an invitation.  Purposefully excluding her would potentially shut the door on any future relationship with her, and who knows, down the road you may wish she was back in your life."
e6ssw0,"NTA

Bullying is fucking disgusting.

Im not saying you need to do this but I'd draw a hard line with the manager (if I could afford it), because I would not want to work in a place that tolerates that sort of attitude."
e6sv72, NTA - And I’d block him.
e6swse,"NTA: coming from someone who has a reaction to the point of breathing issues its up to you guys about getting the cat and not your father.

- little side note if its really a full blown concern just keep one room fully cat free (closed door) and keep an air purifier in there that way its ready at a moments notice

- honestly i can't visit family or friends too long that has a cat, 15min is the max before severe symptoms start to kick in. so i get your dad's side but ultimately its about your guy's happiness"
e6sxze,NTA - she was being racist. that sort of behavior deserves to be pointed out
e6sy6k,Looking for more people to tell you you’re a great friend?
e6t43g,"Easy ESH.  ""i will shove thats statement so far up your ass..."" doesn't make you sound tough in any way shape or form.  Your groupmate sucks, but your reaction was out of bounds and only really comes off as a pathetic empty threat from a fake internet tough guy."
e6t5y4," Nta at all. Cremate her. There is no reason her friends couldn't meet at a park or a restaurant and chat about the good times, but you don't have to shell out for someone who wasn't part of your life."
e6tbzz,"NTA - Everyone has to respect reasonable boundaries. 

I had an acquaintance (lol, referred to as Star as well, funnily enough) behave in a similar way. It became exhausting and I started to expect all my friends to be bringing up issues about her anytime I went anywhere - as thats what happened. 

Banning her is the only option, you have given her chances and she has been warned. She is continuing to behave this way even though she is informed of the consequences. 

Good luck to you, its rough on the guilt dealing with situations like this."
e6tfov,"NTA, I would listen to your parents if I were you. You're at a vulnerable age and could be exploited by this person. Wait until you've got on your feet as an adult and keep your guard up."
e6tjn4,"YTA. Part of being a functional adult is learning when to channel Elsa and let it go. I used to be that person, who always had to be right. It’s exhausting for everyone involved."
e6tmlk,NTA there's no reason to let that person stay with you. They're a stranger. Your son is being an entitled pos. He's not being logical.
e6tmlu,"YTA. 

Joking is fun, and everyone laughs.  Cruelty, on the other hand, is not fun.  Not everyone laughs, because one person feels singled out.  

Also, just because something is true doesn't make it ""OK"" to ""joke"" about.  

Now, if you didn't *intend* to make your sister feel bad, then you can go and apologize.  On the other hand, the way that I read this, you harbor more than a little resentment toward your sister for skating by and not paying her way, so this may have been a way of ""getting back at her""."
e6tn4g,NTA nobody can order you to spend time on a vacation. They should be glad you're going at all if you don't like the woman.
e6tn5f,"YTA. Dude, I come in contact with doctors pretty regularly. If you aren’t making those connections, you’re only going to hurt yourself. When this gets out (not if because this is the type of behavior that gossip lives for) all you’ll be doing is outing yourself as someone difficult to work with, and making your life 20 times harder. 

Have you passed this idea by meddit? How did they respond to it?

Edit: I see you got a mediocre Step 1 CK, and your step 2 was one point above failure. Maybe your bad test scores combined with a not great attitude is why you didn’t match a residency?"
e6toe1,"YTA

Lying to your friend saying its Thursday and its really due Monday is a not the right thing to do.

I would be pissed if I was your friend who worked on getting the project done all night for you to say ""It's actually due Monday.

Even if he doesn't do his part, that's on him not you.

Edit: a word"
e6tp2f,"NTA, but if it would take” hours” to move the trampoline wouldn’t it be worth that time?  Also, aren’t those kids a liability on your trampoline unsupervised?  Moving the item seems like a small price to pay for safety, comfort and peace of mind."
e6tsn2,"NAH. But they aren’t wrong. Don’t open something that isn’t addressed to you unless the recipient has asked you to or given permission. Kinda mail 101.

Edit: I see it was addressed to you. It’s still a kind of crap thing to do since you obviously knew it was something for them."
e6tsu1,"If you present your complaint to management in a logical manner, they may very well understand and possibly take action... Honestly I don’t think anyone’s being a straight up asshole in this situation, however they did unfairly give out the prize. If I was in your shoes i’d definitely feel frustrated as well.

NAH - There are no ill-intentions, just a poor management of the prize. This could end up being a great scenario if management listens to the complaint."
e6tvpp,NTA. What a bunch of dicks.
e6tzw7,NTA what kind of psycho keeps unopened gifts in a closet for 6 months
e6tzwu,"Bro, I’ve slept on those uncomfortable-ass hospital reclining contraptions as has every other red-blooded husband with a pregnant wife.  I can empathize with you on that.

Let’s recap your story:  You WOKE UP your exhausted, overdue wife and TOLD her you were going home to get some sleep b/c this was all just too much for YOU. 

Going home to sleep when you’re exhausted does not make you an asshole.  However, given the circumstances and how you went about doing that- 

100% YTA"
e6u28z,Jokes about rape and assault are not funny. I don't understand why you think he's not an asshole. He's a colossal asshole. You're NTA.
e6u2ts,"NTA

I am virtually never in our office, so any work function is always an imposition, so I never attend. It's unacceptable to demand that a staffer take unpaid time out of their workday for a social function.

That being said, not going is clearly sending a bad message to your employer. Inconvenient though it may be, you may want to attend for the sake of your career development. Conversely, if you can conveniently schedule client activities that prevent your attendance,  you can beg off gracefully."
e6u53w,"NTA - You’re never obligated to touch someone or let them touch you. It’s ALWAYS okay to say no to physical contact that makes you uncomfortable. All your life people will try to push your boundaries...learning how to say no politely and firmly is a skill, and people should always respect no. Anyone who pressures you when you say you’re not confortable, including your mother, is in the wrong."
e6u974,NTA she willingly loaned you said item. Didn't even give it to you properly packaged. You packaged as best you could to drive it home. There's NO WAY either of you could've predicted a car accident. She needs to get over it. Don't loan out anything you aren't willing to lose. Period. Definitely NTA.
e6uaph,Nta. You’re being completely reasonable. Enjoy your day off.
e6ub8w,LED nightlights work give plenty of light without being a sleeping distraction.
e6ue5d,"If you feel that negatively about someone that you needed to say that, then I don't think you should be (or are really) friends. Which is totally okay, hang out with people who bring out the best in you, not the worst."
e6uedi,"Ugh NTA. If she’s calling you a bitch for not sharing your answers with her, she’s not a good friend."
e6ufmj,"NTA. Strongly consider accepting the full ride. I know you want to get out of your bubble but if it’s a good school and you are getting a full ride, that’s truly an excellent opportunity and something you don’t want to waste. 

Take advantage of any scholarship opportunities that come your way."
e6uja0,"NTA at all for not wanting them in your bed. So freaking weird.

A little bit TA for using ""I's"" to indicate possession.  (Just a friendly tease from a grammar nerd!)"
e6ujns,"NTA. Your family sounds horrible; spend Christmas elsewhere. Alternatively, buy a guillotine for the gift exchange and announce that this year you’re dispensing with the bourgeoisie.

Double edit: The best part is, it's a gift for the whole family!  (~~Except~~ *Especially* you, OP.)"
e6ul58,"NAH. I really think you're taking this the wrong way. Your roommate clearly thinks highly enough of you that she wants you to be there for her graduation. That's a pretty big thing. It doesn't sound like she's pressuring you to go. It sounds to me like she was just trying to get you information on how long it would be so that you could see if you could fit it into your schedule. If you don't want to go, just tell her something came up during that time, but that you won't be able to attend. Maybe get her a graduation card for when she gets back from the ceremony and a little treat or gift."
e6unhc,You might want to take a big breather. PPD can really screw with your thinking and judgment. Don't do it.
e6uq38,I would say NAH Bc 1) the cat needs to be on a diet abd you’re roommate can’t have him eating your cats food but 2) restricting your cats movement also isn’t fair. I think you should explore other ways of feeding the cats such as feeding at specific times (where your cat would be locked in your room and his outside) or a food bowl that releases food when the cat wearing a special collar approaches so it can’t be activated by his cat. If you did that he should pay for the feeder since it’s his cats problem
e6utyl,"NAH dude. Labor is sometimes long and slow and surprisingly boring, and you're only human. You will have to keep laughing it off though, because you're never going to live this down. Take it on the chin."
e6uzaw,"Maybe she found it creepy. No one wants sex talk from an uncle!

YTA"
e6v29p,"NTA

Taking your possessions and forcing you to share them against your will is controlling behaviour."
e6v2gx,That doesn't make much sense. Those women would still be allowed in due to being with a man. Frankly lesbian/bi solo women or groups of lesbian/bi women only would be less likely to cause trouble.
e6v82l,"Good god, YTA and I am PRAYING this is a shitpost. 

If not, then I struggled with mental illness all throughout my teens (that’s what those are btw, mental illnesses, not disorders)—and still do—and you sound like you’re handling all of this *really* poorly. Can we be hard to be around? Yes. But guess what? Your son is more miserable than you because he’s the one who’s mentally ill, unable to properly regulate his emotions, all while being a kid. He is your responsibility and you need to help him.

Your post sounds deeply resentful, impatient, and more interested in containing your son than helping him. Get him a therapist, get your own therapist who can teach you how raise your son, and stop acting like he’s constantly scheming and out to get you ffs.

And, guess what? You worry he might have issues with consent? *Then talk to and teach your child why it matters.*"
e6v9cl,"NTA - Justin could have gone to the store for you, and he could have helped you sanitize the tank. If he had cared about what's important to you, he would have gotten what was important to him."
e6v9ii,"NAH. Needing some distance from constant negativity is understandable. Don't tell her she's toxic or affecting your energy negatively in those words though. Maybe say it in a softer way - you could try saying that it's overwhelming you and while you understand how tough it is for her, it's more than you can handle everyday."
e6vbmy,NTA Supporting homophobic organizations is validating their views.
e6vezi,"NTA. She sounds so petty, wtf."
e6vjw8,"NTA but... it sounds like you’ve tried to get her to hang out far too many times with the same response. 

Don’t try anymore. Put the ball in her court and see how long it takes her to contact you to hang out. It’ll be hard but if she’s a real friend, she’ll make contact and stick to plans. Don’t waste your time on someone who isn’t giving you any of hers."
e6vkdj,"NTA – congratulations, you are dating a selfish child"
e6vlwq,"NTA, but you weren't bullied.  You were pressured, and probably unintentionally.  There's a difference.

Tell Ryan it's out of your budget and ask for another suggestion."
e6voa8,"NAH. Set up a timeline that is reasonable for her and for you for her to pay you back. 

If she seems like she doesn’t want to then she’s the AH."
e6vpuh,NTA. Quite the contrary. You were friendly. She should be considerate of the public space.
e6vr6a,NTA.  The cross became a popular secular piece of jewelry decades ago.
e6vuby,"YTA because sometimes plans change and adulting involves understanding that work obligations sometimes take precedence in order to continue providing. 

I can't honestly connect your comments about his haircut to your comments about the cabin. You sound really passive aggressive and petulant. Go to the work event with him to show your support and be proud of his accomplishments. Then take him to the cabin to celebrate privately. 

As for the haircut, it's just hair. Bad cuts happen. Guess what? It won't last forever, but the way you treat him over all this will certainly leave a lasting impression."
e6vx0j,NTA. Calvin and Hobbes is totally age appropriate for your daughter. I would talk to your wife and ask how she finds it inappropriate and go from there. Good luck!!
e6vxh8,ESH - she’s a bad mom. That was a petty post. Maybe y’all need a custody agreement enforced by the court.
e6vy8d,"YTA, your mum is right, its not your place. Why do you have to post all about it on fb? Sounds like you just want attention and to stir some shit up. Doing it literally benefits you in zero ways and just hurts people."
e6w076,Yes you’re the asshole. You can’t be kind to someone for the expectation that they will fuck you. You’re basically exploiting them for sex at this point.
e6w86u,Absolutely not. And you should tell them that when you do quit. NTA
e6watg,"NTA, but I'd just be honest. If they're so set on having expensive stag and hen dos, they need to be prepared that some people can't afford it. There's no shame in that. If they're angry people can't come, they're just being bride/groomzillas because, honestly, who puts the destination above being able to have fun with your friends?"
e6wbpc,"NTA- your mother's sperm donor effectively abandoned you. You owe him nothing as a father, because he effectively wasn't one. As you said, you feel bad as a person, so you aren't a monster. But you owe him nothing"
e6wcdq,"Tell them they have to also bring salads potato,  pasta,  and regular. 

Or tell everyone it's 25 or 30 bucks minimum spend and they have to confirm their choices with you first so you can ensure everyone's pitching in and covered fairly.

OR no one can only bring drinks everyone must bring food and one drink or one salad. Also to let you know which it is so you can be sure there's enough food and drink lol"
e6wfqo,"NTA at all, first off if he wants to hold you the standard of a ""real"" babysitter, charge $20 an hour, $30 for between 8pm-8am. Probably more for twins. Then he can have price of the book back, for repairs. Like i cannot stress enough that $40 for babysitting two days is nothing.  
But all pettiness aside, you did them a favor. He's T A if he thinks you owe him something."
e6wnmo,NAH - It's like idiots that leave their towels on gym equipment to claim it as their own. And then trot off to the other side of the gym to do something else for half an hour. You were there for a full hour before he got back!
e6woqu,"The whole text exchange makes me feel like I’m reading a soap opera, holy shit. 

Anyways, NTA. She honestly sounds crazy and frankly I wouldn’t want to associate myself with someone like her. You communicated your feelings to her in a respectful manner and it’s sincerely her problem that she’s not taking it well."
e6worj,NTA - i‘m sure there are other people who could help here and even if not she knew you were already late and i hate when family does this thing that only they are important.it‘s just petty and immature
e6wpi4,"NTA - what sort of company asks the staff to pay bonuses. Bonuses come from the company's profits, not from other staff."
e6wpqb,NAH. What you described is typical teenager angst. You think your family and the world doesn't understand you. I have been there myself. It's the chemicals in your body going a bit crazy. Don't worry. It's normal. Hang in there.
e6wrfk,"NTA

I'm just getting a kick out of this. I truly enjoy how much consideration you have put into something so small - it's a good thing!

I don't know how old you are, but mature people aren't going to stop being your friend over this if they are actually a friend. Just let your friend know your reasons and offer to share his playlist with him so he doesn't lose it if he makes his own account."
e6wwc7,"NTA. Believe it or not, women can move out of the way too! Whenever I'm walking next to someone (I'm a 5'3'' female) and I see someone coming up on me, I drop back to walk behind the person I was walking next to until we pass the person. It's called being a considerate person. If someone chooses to take up a ton of room on the sidewalk and not move out of the way when another person is approaching, they deserve to get bumped into."
e6wzl9,"ESH. It's not your place to demand they divorce, but it's 100% your place to refuse to subject your children to it. Maybe only allow them visits individually and supervised, then see if they can keep their complaints about the other to themselves?"
e6x392,"NTA - people who are your friend under the expectation that you will give them things arent really your friends. If that's the case, then you can find better friends. On the other hand, it could be that he misunderstood your refusal as you not trusting him, in which case NAH and maybe try talking to him about it again?

Also, for the sake of clarity, I think you meant lend, not borrow. It's a common mistake, but the person giving is the lender and the person receiving is the borrower. I knew what you meant immediately because I know plenty of people who speak english as a second language and they do the same thing."
e6x4sr,"YTA, cat pics are the best. Nah jk, but instead of calling her out in a bad mood you could've just said it politely. Ya know just like 'hey thanks for sending me the pics but I'm not that much of an animal person and don't really want them, no offense.'"
e6x6qe,NTA. It's your home. You get to decide who comes around or not. Just be prepared to see less of BIL for a while.
e6xham,[deleted]
e6xkjg,"NTA ... 

Though I would be moving out asap and considering this might end whatever relationship you do have w/ your father."
e6xm8t,"NTA 

She should have never talked to you.  It’s none of her business."
e6xndm,NTA if you poke fun at someone's obvious trauma what do you expect to happen
e6xs9h,"NTA and frankly, your boyfriend's being a bit of an ass if he doesn't even bother to like stand up for you."
e6xtym,"NTA your bf is gonna have to learn about women sometime. I walk around in my underwear all the time. Period or no. Thankfully my bf doesn’t make me feel bad about my period. When I’ve leaked through during the night a couple times, he’s been totally kind about it. During the day I obviously make sure to change my protection frequently, and like you I wear a tampon as well as a pad. Your bf is being immature and rude"
e6xuo1,"NTA. It will probably upset your dad, but you're not obligated to keep something just to make him happy. If it comes up, which it probably will, be honest with him. That's really all you can do. He dictates his own reaction from there and you're really not responsible for that."
e6y3h3,"NTA wanting to have the celebration at your house. 

But, you could always let your brother-in-law and sister-in-law decide since it’s their problem if their kids get upset? I don’t mean that to sound harsh. You’re trying to do something nice for them! But if they don’t really have a problem driving the extra 30 minutes then there is no problem.

Your father-in-law may be a little over the top here, and if you’d like to have the holidays at your house next year maybe start planting that seed early this year. It shouldn’t really matter where you are as long as you’re together. 

People get really funny (read: crazy) at Christmas time. It’s actually the most stressful thing about the holiday in my family. Everyone deciding who’s going where and when... and if you can’t make it to someone’s house they get offended. There’s only so many hours in a day and as time goes on and families grow bigger there’s more and more places to go. 

I’ve stepped back from going to a lot of gatherings. No regrets!"
e6y8a4,NAH but go over there with a plate of cookies and explain in a friendly way that their bright light is flooding your home at night and that you’re wondering if they could adjust it so it points more into their own yard. Letters can very easily come off as hostile.
e6yc0c,NTA. And I really strongly dislike your mother on your behalf.
e6yi2x,"NAH. There are no tickets purchased and you’re not leaving him in a lurch. Take the trip that *you* want. It’s your time, money, and holiday experience (and if you don’t really want to be there your lack of enthusiasm may dampen his enjoyment). 

Happy holidays and safe travels to wherever your final destination."
e6yomm,"NTA he was either trying to shame you, or being Pervy (or both). Neither of those things is okay in any setting. Report him."
e6ypvb,"If you don't like the scent that much, you have two options:
1) Gift her a nice perfume, saying it's a token of gratitude for taking care of your child. Or just as Christmas present;
2) Find another nanny.

Dictating her how to manage her life and what kind of perfume to use ain't one of them, imho.

BTW, NAH."
e6yqs4,"ESH. He definitely isn't acting in a way that you would expect your friends to act. I don't blame you for questioning your friendship with him. 

However, you waited until the day before the concert to decide that you no longer want to go with him. That leaves him very little time to find alternative plans."
e6yud3,YTA. You gossiped about him behind his back.
e6yvo9,"NTA but frankly this feels like a humble brag. Yeah, you’re doing the right thing but you already know that"
e6yvyt,"NTA. If he's just a FWB then it shouldn't matter that they cannot meet your kids. It's your choice, not theirs"
e6yz0g,You are NTA to calmly and accurately inform a business of bad customer service.  You always have that right.
e6yz54,"ESH  
\-your brother: his marriage ceremony was so expensive, that everyone, including your parents who he probably knew didn't have money, had to chip in  
\-your parents: they obviously do not know how to handle money. since you said they had options, could have saved up, if not for themselves, for their children. they bought gifts when your father lost his job, which is hella irresponsible  


\-you: living rent free, going to dubai, having money for going out, and still asking them for money when you know they can't afford.  


\-you sister: she good tho  


Seems like all of you had options to save money and not be in this situation. I don't think it's too late to start saving, things can always be better. You know - you live, you learn."
e6z3r3,NTA obviously. But shitty company rules. Such a waste of food.
e6z7yr,"YTA.  I think you are crossing the line from ""concerned parent who wants to be involved in their child's education"" to ""that control freak who never shuts up at the PTA meetings"" stereotype.   If you think your child's project was offensive, then you can discuss it with them/correct them at home.  

Also I don't think your concern about them thinking slavery/civil rights movement is all there is to african american culture is valid - especially with young children, it's only natural to focus on the big historical things, and the rest will be filled in as they progress through school.  You can't condense an entire culture completely/accurately into one project."
e6zh9l,"NTA, I lived with my boyfriend throughout college like this but I only did it with pre-approval from his roommates. (My parents are ""traditional"" and wouldn't let me sign a lease with my boyfriend). I also contributed to the bills of that house. You however didn't sign up for this. She is free to bring her boyfriend over and spend the night, but he can't live there without your permission. Are you renting? Most leases say you can't have a visitor for longer than 2 weeks so maybe you can look into that and bring it up with her. Otherwise I would ask her if she can designate only 3 nights a week with him there or something. You deserve to have that space the way you want just as much as her."
e6ziqr,"NTA

Your roommate promised things that weren't hers and felt it would be just fine to take what she wanted without asking.

If she doesn't apologize, it's time for a new roommate."
e6ziu1,"NTA

This is the future she chose with her actions. She needs to learn to live with the consequences.

Going forward, your kids will be splitting holidays between parents. That's just how it is. She has no one to blame but herself.

Stick to your plan."
e6zrfs,"NTA it is sometimes easier to test the reaction of strangers, so we can gain strength to tell the others in our life"
e6zt41,"NAH. It bothers me that your concerned with rent instead of rehab but I can't call you an asshole for it if he agreed to pay half in 1st place. 

In situations like this, I always wonder did you move in a partner or did you want a roommate to help with bills?"
e6zxd4,"NTA at all. Your request of a non-band/gaming related shirt 5 days a year is *totally* reasonable. Hell not even that, you sound like you're even fine with certain video game shirts on those days.

e6zzqf,NAH - but I think you are a kind person for worrying about this.
e700zg,"NTA for not donating, but you might want to take your own advice about going somewhere else if you're that salty about your current compensation.  (And if your reaction is ""it's not that simple,"" maybe think about why the cleaning staff might feel the same way.)"

e704pz,"NAH - you should be able to joke about whatever you want.  Just know that when you joke about things that are very spiritual and important to certain people, you may very easily end up offending them. Know who your audience is when you make jokes about things like religion. And if you do offend someone when you did not want to, and you feel bad for it, its very simple to say that it wasn't your intention and that you're sorry for having offended. Normally that can smooth things over on all sides"

She gave you a car. Meaning she purchased it, fronting you the money.

You are entitled to nothing, really. Her giving you the $500 is more than what you deserve (you think you deserve money for maintaining your vehicle that you drive...)

They probably wouldn't be reacting like this if you hadn't corrected them pretentiously in the past. It's annoying to have someone correct you sanctimoniously about the pronunciation of a word.

e71gzj,"NTA - You cant agree to a deal then decide 5 months later that it doesn't make sense.

If he had come back after an hour or a day then I would be more inclined to suggest having that discussion, but 5 months is way past the figurative 'return' date."
e71h54,Are you cancelling because she won't leave for the night? It seems like YTA here for asking her to move in and then asking her to leave for a night as if she doesn't share the place with you. This is equally her space and you can just be considerate of the fact and maybe be the grown adults you and your friends are and behave as such.
e71ic4,"YTA, of course.  Why would you even imagine it's acceptable to do this?

If the old brewery had encouraged you to throw the pint glasses on the floor when you needed a refill would you have done that at this new place?  Of course not.  What the old brewery did/allowed doesn't mean anything.  They're two separate businesses and the manager should have tossed you out."

e71lmj,"NTA. I know this will get downvoted into oblivion, but your sister already had her PPD (pretty princess day). I understand and totally get vow renewals, but they are not second weddings. Personally, I think wearing a wedding dress to a vow renewal is gauche because you already had your day and now it looks like you just want that attention again. There are plenty of gorgeous dresses out there specifically for vow renewals. Had it been her wedding, I would have voted differently because I think in that case, you should have run it by her before you bought it since you both liked it. But she's mad at you for wanting a taste when she's looking to take two bites out of the apple."

I'm prepared to be down-voted, because this sub seems to hate it when you call the person who was an AH in response to an AH an AH.

The manager is OBVIOUSLY TA, and he was TA first. However, in your account, you say you left your aisles in a condition that is ""borderline unsafe,"" and that you shouldn't have taken it as far as you did. That's what AHs do. I do understand your reaction, but that doesn't change the facts of it.

What you could have done is asked AH Manager for an example of shelves stocked to his liking, and just done your job. You like how big mart did things better. I think I would too. But now you work for small mart. You can do things in their messier way, without setting up unsafe conditions (and without setting the scene for non-injurious disasters), but you chose to go full AH. Just own it. We're all AH once in a while."

e72dcn,"YTA because you were aggressive in your first contact. 

You called them rude and ignorant even here, where I presume you've tempered your actual words for the retelling. Your first effort with neighbors should be even-keeled and request-based instead of accusatory and demanding. 

Let your wife handle these conversations if you can't help but approach like this."

And your comment about an old affair she JUST found out about? Seems like a legit concern to not want you to have illegitimate children. She's obviously still hurting from that news and now knows the potential to cheat again is there since you did once. 

Do you not realize what her body went through, TWICE, to get your wonderful children here? And the ablation procedure isn't a walk in the park either. I think going through with a vasectomy is the least you could do at this point to A. Give her peace of mind and B. Show her you can and are willing to keep promises, especially since you cheated. Have you even discussed with her why you don't want to do this now?"
e77ywu,"I’m gonna try to save you a whole lot of trouble though it probably won’t help: what you see is what you get.   


You’re marrying him.. hopefully you like him enough to put up with his flaws. If that means socializing separately some of the time then so be it. If you can make friends first and then bring them into a joint social circle, that would be good. And maybe you can develop some techniques to help the social situations go a little better — instead of moving around and grabbing plates, try to launch into your own story that involves a situation that everyone can relate to.   


But asking him to “tone it down” and telling him he has to “practice his talking” is only going to lead to his hurt feelings and your frustration. YTA mildly for going ahead with that"
e780my,"This sounds like a butt-out situation. It sounds like you eat some meals with her and she is not comfortable with you. You have literally no idea what she eats the rest of the time.

At my last secret Santa everyone else got personalized gifts and cool stuff that related to them, while my Santa got me cheap slippers and a fake leather wallet (neither of which I have ever indicated I cared about)... that still had the clearance stickers on it. The person just bought whatever was cheap and threw it in a box, and I was super disappointed. I put a lot of thought into what I got for my giftee, and my Santa just didn't give a single shit.

So, no. I don't blame you at all. Getting a giftcard while everyone else gets personalized cool stuff sucks."
e78dsu,"NTA -- And be wary of any guy in 2019 who says he wouldn't feel like a man if you showed him appreciation and affection in the form of a gift.  That he employed a full-on double standard doesn't help his case.  This kind of thing seems relatively benign when we're talking Christmas gifts.  But it more often than not has much deeper implications the more you two become invested.

I'm not going to go down the list, but I'm not exactly starved for masculine duties and traits.  Never would my sense of manhood be threatened if my wife decided she wanted to go the extra mile treating me."

Lots of people are bad at parking (not saying that you are, just in need of a little correcting). When I see someone parked poorly (outside of or super close to the lines) I just don’t go near them because there are always other spots. Especially since there were a lot of other empties near you and you made an effort to isolate yourself from other cars. If he was trying to “teach you a lesson” that would make him a bit of an ass IMO. I drive 12-15 hours a week and have accepted that 80% of people are just terrible at driving  and cannot be taught by me or anyone else on the road 🤷🏽‍♂️ (again, not that you are, just speaking generally!)"

You know from your dad's attitude that you will likely be unable to go to him for help of any kind after you are 18 you may even be kicked out when you are 18. These are realities you need to start preparing for now.    

- Tell family who might provide support, your mums side and those sympathetic to you on your dads side. 
- deal with your issues now through professional therapy. your school, if it doesn't have someone itself may have a list of resources young people like you can access free of cheap. you can also ask professionals in the area or look stuff up online. 
- look at getting a job asap, get some money saved up    
- look for resources in your area for job search help, food, bill, rent, housing assistance, things of that nature. Ask at every place if they know of more resources, many small local nonprofits may be hard to find through things like google

If you don't want to be around the guy, don't.

But it sounds like he is habitually being mean. As much as I don't like to immediately say 'cut and run,' it might be for the best."
e79n8g,NAH you’re trying your best and I can only assume so is she. She may be a little bit rude with her approach but she does have a point in wanting the work done.

I moved out at 19 for similar reasons with my parents, and honestly my moving out has done wonders for our relationships!

You're an adult! If you can afford it, move out and get some distance, but don't sever the relationship! Be thoughtful and still spend time with her if you can."

Also, hosting a party can be a lot of work, so you could use that as an excuse if she's being too much. (Like, ""hey excuse me for a second I have to go get more drinks for everyone"" or something.)

If you don't invite her, just don't rub it in her face, and be prepared for her to maybe get upset if she sees it on social media. Again, it's your party though."

I think Sarah is kind of right that 2 months is early but I don’t think she should have said anything it’s not her life. But you were saving up this insult in your bank to use to ‘get back at her’. I would say be an adult and just be direct in conversations but you aren’t adults yet and I doubt you would do this
e7a077,"Gentle YTA. I don't think she's wrong to want to wear jewelry from her first wedding to her second one. If she was divorced I'd say that was a little odd, and you might be right to have a problem with it. But she may just be trying to bring the memory of someone she loved - and lost - with her on this new journey, by wearing the same jewelry. It doesn't mean she doesn't love you. 
You do sound a little jealous of a man who's dead and gone. Might wanna work on that."

e7a21o,"NTA - there is a fine line to walk when talking to parents about their choices for their children.  Since you’re babysitting and helping out I don’t think it’d be wrong to kindly and tactfully bring up diet.  Saying “you guys feed your kid awful food” won’t go far as parents will get defensive.  

You could say something like “I haven’t been eating enough vegetables, what if we tried to work some different stuff into all our diets this week, I think (kid’s name) would really like it.”"
e7a2qk,"NTA - you should just contact her and tell her about your loss. It would be women to women conversation about loss. It is very possible that others in the family have suffered a loss too.

e7aapw,"NTA.

It’s tough for transgendered people today in our climate, especially when it comes to family members accepting them.

But your father (still your father by birth) needs to understand you went 17 years knowing him as DAD. She was DAD. She can’t expect you to at the drop of a hat change all that. On top of that, her partner is trying to push that and IS being manipulative by messaging you that. They’re trying to guilt trip you. Your brothers reaction seemed over the top but you were not. These things take time and your father needs to understand what she erasing with asking you to call her “mom”

Edit* fixed pro-nouns"
e7actt,"NAH. You tried to get your partner's approval, and thought you had it. If he feels differently, he should have said something when it sounds like he was consistently given a chance.

If she doesn't wanna let you know there's a ""guest"", which mostly appears to mean stranger, she shouldn't expect your to go out of your way to greet them.  They are her guest, not yours; you are not the host.  It's her job to entertain them, or ask you to come say hi if she feels you need to.  


That said, you'll never convince her of this, so it might be easier to just go greet them until you can move out."

e7b5rk,"NTA - He seems like he’s doing this often and like he’s planning to do it in the future as well since he’s talking about “the next time”. Him planning on getting plastered and not being able to care for himself is NOT your responsibility. I would consider this a warning sign. People who can’t hold their liquor and people who can’t stand being responsible for their own actions rarely make good bf material. If you guys set the rule this early, that he goes out and get smashed and you have to stay home sober to be his chauffeur whenever he feels like getting his free ride home, it will never change. Nip it in the bud! I’m not telling you to break up with him, but you need to clarify what the hell is going on before it gets worse."

e7bm0q,"NAH, but since you're only staying on weekends I would have thought it made more sense to just leave your sheets on for a few weeks and change them if/when a ""guest"" needs the room. I do think you should probably just change the sheets as asked, because if you're sleeping on a thick blanket the blanket itself will need to be washed as often as your own sheets would."
e7bowq,"NAH, just a lot of early-teenage-drama.

Friends are allowed to have different opinions on some topics.
On the other side, they are also allowed to have feelings, and your friend is clearly feeling hurt.

Generalizing (such as ""boys are cowards"") is never a good idea, as it rarely is true and it can lead to hurting other people's feelings. It can be a joke, but even then you need to know your audience.

She being hurt about this whole story is understandable but she seems to be overreacting, but it would be a really bad idea to tell her so.
Just try to find her during a calm minute and talk to her again. Maybe tell her that you also feel a bit hurt by her comment, she will probably be able to empathize with your feelings if she can't understand reasoning."
e7brlu,You’re definitely NTA! If you’re not asking for the kid to come to your house and you didn’t consent to taking care of the child there isn’t any reason you should have to. If you mom needs alone time maybe she should have thought about that before brining the kid to her house.
e7bv78,"NTA. Tell him, straight up. He would probably be more mad if you'd kept it from him. No good person would ever cheat - your friend deserves the backlash. They might dislike you for a while, but in the long run, he'll thank you.

""If it might hurt in the beginning, but will be beneficial in the end, speak the truth."""
e7bxsf,"Your friend is probably embarrassed that she felt singled out in front of your friends and so is turning it back on you so that she doesn't seem like she had the problem. I wouldn't give it a second thought. It's happened, move on. I wouldn't overthink it. I wouldn't mention it as you'll be going into difficult territory where you say something you regret or makes her even more upset. If she confront you, just say I'm sorry you feel that way and leave it at that."
e7bxvv,"NTA.

But I would brush it off. This would only be an HR thing if you actually worked with her and she was abusive at work. But this just sounds like a drunk person at a party.

I saw someone else said to talk to her about it. I absolutely would not do this. What would be accomplished by talking to someone you never interact with? If you actually get a job there AND you end up working with her, then maybe address it then. 

Otherwise this is all just hurt feelings."
e7bztj,"I actually think YTA, despite the obvious outcome being the opposite,

Hear me out, the way you're describing your relationship with her doesn't sound like you actually do have a crush on her. It sounds like you're worried you are going to develop one.

So hear me out, stop talking to her. 

If you all you do currently is ""snap back and forth"" you're not exactly the biggest part of one another's lives, and by continuing to speak to her knowing full well you may end up falling for her you do yourself, your ex AND her a disservice, all you will achieve is drama. 

So yeah,

e7c4gq,"NTA - And incorrect, it’s your baby with your boyfriend. It’s for both of you to calm the baby. If his part in that is to tell his friends, guests in your home, to shut the fuck up for 10 minutes then he should of done that and supported you more."

As an introvert, I love time to my self also. However family is family, and I do make sure there’s times for them. Even if I don’t get much from it, they do. So I’d say it requires a sit down talk. Explain how you feel, but recognise their feeling and views. Find a middle ground where you get to spend your time doing what you like, while maybe also agreeing to have time aside to do things with them."
e7ccta,NTA. Your post is hard to follow. From what I understand you wish to move in with your girlfriend. You believe she should pay rent at half the price or a proportional value. However you have oresented a cheaper alternative for her by purchasing an apartment. She just doesnt want to pay you rent if you own the apartment just her share of the bills. I would disagree with her on this. That is not a fair arrangement.
e7cetp,"NAH. He’s excited, a riff doesn’t take long to play. And he wants to share his progress with you. Which I think is really sweet cause it means you’re important to him.

You want to study and be left alone for your exam which is also fair.

You’re brothers. Sort it out."

e7cmj7,"The only thing you are guilty of is being unassertive. Did you even try to explain your side to the teacher? 

Even if it is months later, you should still talk to this teacher if you still have class with them. Maybe there’s something they can do to adjust your current grade. If you don’t stand up for yourself, no one else will. So definite NTA"
e7d3sc,"NAH, but it does sound like rather than helping your friend, you're enabling him to live off other people. If he can't afford gas, he can't afford a car. And if he had the money for a car, he had the money for rent and chose not to spend it on that.

How long do you anticipate this set-up continuing for?"
e7d41f,"NTA

She's a manipulator, leave her."
e7dc3z,"You've told your mum you'll be ""around"" on Christmas, yeah? Well if you haven't specifically said ""I'll be there on Christmas *day*""... You've got an out excuse.

You should absolutely visit your girlfriend on Christmas day. She'll be really upset if you don't.

YWBTA if you don't. But you will be disappointing one side, but if you're smart with the dates and times it doesn't have to be a *crushing* disappointment."
e7delp,ESH fucking teenagers just carry on in a few years the world won't be the same for you
e7dexw,"NTA-  If it would have been many hours before you were supposed to go out with your buddy then maybe. But it was an hour and half before, that would have been rude. I encourage my boyfriend to have time with his friends. If I would have canceled and told him to make other plans, I couldn’t or wouldn’t be mad if I felt better and changed my mind. I wouldn’t of even asked him to cancel."
e7dhg1,"NTA   
But you may have been a bit tactless.     

IF you want to help this friend you should do so at a time other than your own work out time.   
Tell him your own workout is very well defined and timed and doesn't include time for interaction. Say that if he wants to learn how to workout it needs to be at a time other than your own workout window.    
Tell him to be there right around the time you are done and you will get him started. Assign him treadmill work then go on your way- once he learns how to work it you don't need to be there to hold his hand.  
Next time assign him a free weight task and get him started.  Next time get his set up on a machine. Give him ten minutes after your workout is done and get him familiar with things.  

Point is you can help him without compromising your own schedule if you don't try to accomplish both things at the same time."
e7dn7c,"NTA, you set up some boundaries and *politely* requested her to follow them, so you then tried a little harder, when that didn’t work you just reminded her that you set boundaries and want them to be respected, next time I would try asking her how she would feel if whenever you wanted you would just up and enter her room and disregard *her* boundaries."
e7dvft,"YTA, You’re completely glossing over the fact that the person that didn’t keep their mouth shut is you, not your mom. You were the one that was trusted with a secret and blabbed. She’s not wrong to be concerned especially since she’s hearing about the hospitalization  from a third party. Keep your secrets better."
e7dwsq,"NTA because you found out you were pregnant after giving the go-ahead for him to put his name in. This should have been a discussion when you found out about the pregnancy, rather than him dropping the bomb on you. But yeah, having him go away for two months right after you have birth is not ok. 

It’s necessary to adapt your dreams to the reality of your life. I hope he doesn’t act resentful towards you, I would try to have some conversations about improving your communication and moving forward as more of a team than you currently are."
e7dxaj,"NTA - you’re 15. I think it’s amazing you’ve found a way to earn money. No one should expect a 15yo to contribute to bills. The fact that you pay for coffee/ meals is above and over IMO.  

It’s your money. Great that you’re saving it, but also you shouldn’t be pressured to (but it is smart!). 

Only thing would be is if your family is struggling for money, I could see how they’d appreciate contribution. 

Unfortunately other than having a sit down chat and discussing it, I don’t have any suggestions of how to resolve the conflict. Apologies."

e7e82w,"NTA, but you would do better with legal advice. If there is a will there should be an executor handling the estate. Or you may not have heard anything from the executor because the will is in probate.

If there is no legally valid will then it depends on the local laws for who inherits. However if things were jointly owned they would generally go to the other owner (so if the house and bank accounts were jointly owned with his GF, she simply continues owning them)."

This was an easy open and shut case!"
e7eqvx,NTA obviously. People should be more afraid of misinformation.
e7excm,"ESH. You shouldn’t be claiming to be Jewish, and obviously racist old ladies suck.

e7frkb,"ESH but step daughter is TA. SD needs to stop thieving and pull her shit together, but to make her move out for eating in her room is an overreaction (but understandable to make her move out for stealing, my point is not that she shouldn’t move out, but the fact that you list eating in her room as a reason). Mom needs to put her foot down and act as you two agreed towards SD, communicate with you."
e7fs18,"NTA - when you’re dead, you’re dead. Who cares what happens to your remains.

e7fwxc,"NAH.  Your BF was upfront at the very beginning that football was going to be more important than you or anything else.  You chose to ignore that because - let's be honest here - you thought he was joking or that he would change.  Now that you've discovered he wasn't joking and isn't going to change, you've realized how much it sucks to be a partner to someone who thinks football is more important than you.

He's being reasonable because he told you about this in advance and is being absolutely consistent with what he warned you about and you agreed to.  You're being reasonable to not want to be with someone who will always choose to sit and watch football over you.  So neither of you are assholes, but you're also not a good match for each other since you clearly want different things in a relationship."
e7fy9u,"NTA  
You cannot sacrifice your team and your department for one person who is actively working against the department, you, and ultimately the company.

e7g6dn,"NAH. You definitely shouldn't feel too bad about not really being up for it that one weekend, that's totally understandable and justified. But it also makes sense for her to be a little bit disappointed as it was her birthday, but no one is really in the wrong here."

You completely misunderstood what she meant when she said, ""We're all the same lying down."" It was not even a dig at you. She means that height difference doesn't matter that much.  You insulting her in response to that doesn't even make sense, let alone jabbing at her greatest insecurity when she was trying to make you feel better about yours. That's so awkward that you said that."
e7gsr5,"NTA for reporting facts.  Just do two things here. One, make sure your comments are anonymous and contain no identifying information so as to not harm your own educational prospects.  Two, stick to facts.  They are more relevant to the situation and more helpful for the person reading the evaluation.  Knowing a student feels a Prof has anger issues isn't helpful.  Knowing a student reported they witnessed a Prof yelling at students, and physically attacking an object in anger, that's quite another."
e7gt18,"NTA

You wouldn't be an asshole, but I think it wouldn't be a smart move to provoke a guy with a history of abusive tendencies (sorry I snooped).  You're in a really shit situation, and I'm sorry.  I hope you find a way out."
e7gt6s,"NAH eviction was bound to happen for them. Everyone gets evicted from their rentals, either by themselves or from their landlord.

e7hkn7,"NAH. Your dad probably thinks he’s doing the noble thing, but in fact, he’s being incredibly selfish. When family courts make custody decisions, they consider what’s in the best interest of the child. The crying shame of this is that both divorced parents believe that it’s in the best interest of their child to have that child live with them. You need to have a gentle discussion with your father and be honest about the reasons you don’t want to live with him full time. Seems to me you have good ones."
e7hnpv,NTA some people never wear underwear this is actually very common. especially with leggings

e7i23a,"ESH. He makes derogatory remarks about his brother, shares filthy shit with you guys, and is in general disgusting in public. You, rather than telling hijm to knock it off, lowered yourself to his level with equally disgusting shit, and made it borderline incestuous. Like, I don't know ANYONE who talks about explicit sex moves with their siblings."
e7i64n,"NTA (putting aside the “slutty” comment for a second) because this girl is NOT a nice person as you claim. She continues to do things that she knows will hurt the people around her like sleeping with that girl’s recent ex or making out with an engaged coworker. She knows those situations will upset other people but she continues to engage in them anyway. So that makes her an asshole.

You however, should reconsider your wording here. The problem is not that she’s being “slutty”. She’s being a bitch as I said above. But you have no right to judge her one how frequently she has sex because that is her own choice. The issue isn’t how often, but who she chooses to hurt in the process. Women should be allowed to have as much sex as they want without being shamed."
e7i7w8,ESH...you shouldn’t play guitar in a dorm room and he shouldn’t sing loudly all the time. What you really need to do is complain every single time you hear him. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
e7i9qr,NTA - Obviously not. The other family didn't have the money in the first place.
e7ib3s,NTA you already tried to help him. He had to learn at some point to check over his work to make sure everything was correct.
e7ijaz,"NTA  
He clearly needs professional help if it's causing him so much distress and he talks about it everyday. For him to expect you to be his therapist is just too much. You are not an asshole for setting boundaries."
e7ikhq,"NTA but I think you have a sorta flawed understanding of fat acceptance.

> I know fat acceptance is a bullshit and you shouldn’t encourage someone to tolerate their harmful lifestyle, but it does affect me.

Fat acceptance isn't encouraging people to be fat, it's exactly what you are asking for, not being shamed for simply existing. Your weight isn't his concern and then next time he brings it up you are well within your rights to call him a jerk. He should mind his own damn business. Thats not you ""accepting"" yourself as fat, it's telling him being openly rude to you isn't okay."
e7inom,"NTA. 

I have a similar issue with my FIL. He’s a big trump supporter and goes off on these anti immigrant rants and then points to me and says “not you of course, you’re one of the few good ones”. Yah, fuck that and fuck him. I don’t spend time around him and my wife is perfectly fine with that."
e7io1v,"YTA. It's not a joke if the other person is crying, it's bullying."
e7ipzx,"I mean, NTA, you can refuse to see your family if you want. But if your daughter really has panic attacks by just mentioning family get-togethers, and is really struggling with depression and anxiety, she needs to get professional help. Avoiding situations that give her anxiety or induce panic attacks isn't going to help her in the long run.

Edit: and just to clarify, you're doing a good job at standing up for your daughter. It's wrong of your sisters to not even apologize to her. I'm mostly worried about how she's starting to get anxious seeing her father's side of the family."
e7isyh,"NAH - this is a good time to educate them about consent and personal boundaries. Plenty of girls/women value their personal space and don't want to be touched. 

I get that their just kids though."
e7iukp,YTA again for blaming the victim of harassment for her own harassment.
e7iv6e,"NAH... But have you asked her if she wants to go anywhere with you? Maybe she'll surprise you... Maybe she will just want to go to the mall, which one day a year won't really hurt you... Or maybe she will say she doesn't want to, and you won't have to worry about being the asshole."
e7j0rt,"Personally, I say NTA because it's my opinion that  adults who get sulky or upset about gifts are fucking *weird*. A little thing for the person hosting can be a sweet gesture but being expected to show up with a gift for every adult present is bizarre.

That being said, different families have different traditions and expectations so if your partner says it should happen, then you should probably follow his lead, or be prepared to face the social fallout."

Going to one event and then bailing on the other because you don't like your coworkers makes YTA.  Also you are TA for exposing your orchestra to the flu."

In about five months start looking for a new place to live."
e7jabh,"NTA. 

But here, you dropped these 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

Figure out your shit with your boyfriend before your kid is born because it's not going to get easier. You're not freeloading, you're having his child and he should be helping to support you. Yes get a new place when you can, but for your boyfriend, supporting someone you love who's carrying your child at little to no impact to yourself is a low bar. 

Sit down with him and calmly figure out how to resolve this conflict. Talk to his parents and make sure it's not a problem you're there. Make a concrete plan for moving out but ideally live with the parent of your child because that's whats best for your child."

e7jg8l,"NAH. I can sort of see your perspective on this, but I don't think your partner prioritized sitting up front over going with you but rather prioritized giving their child a better experience (which I don't think is unreasonable). If your partner had done this with another adult it would have been different, but considering it was a child I think the priority here was the child. I hope this makes sense, I feel like I did a horrible job of explaining"

e7jpmp,"YTA if you regift this as his Christmas present.  It's tone deaf and thoughtless on several levels.  For Christmas, get him something without any emotional baggage.

It would not be at all wrong or rude if sometime other than Christmas if you told him about the source of the gift and offered to let him use/have it.  That way he can decide if it has baggage as far as he's concerned.  ""Oh, you would like your own Chess board?  I have this one that ex gave me and although it's gorgeous, I don't use it.  You're welcome to have it if you'd like.""  Very different than wrapping it up and putting it under the Christmas tree as a special gift for him."
e7jq34,"NTA, Controversial opinion but deleting the picture doesn't really make you an asshole. It's petty, but lets all get a little bit of a grip.  It's just a digital photo of a random porn star, pretty easy to recover if he REALLY wanted it back, it's not some ultimate betrayal. People on Reddit get so defensive about porn, but it's kind of normal to  have feelings of jealousy about these kind of things, and it's not like you went through his phone to find it without his permission. You just saw it and reacted. It happens. You didn't need to delete it, but it's not that deep.

I think there is a much bigger picture here that is being a bit overlooked. You say your husband has a drinking problem, he is mean and you demonstrated by this story that he doesn't really give much of a shit about how he makes you feel."
e7jr0a,"NAH

It sounds like he's spiraling, and it can be hard to gauge how your behavior is affecting others when that happens. You have a responsibility to your customers and other employees, and his behavior was unprofessional and making people uncomfortable. I hesitate to call him TA because he is grieving the entire life he had before it came (and still is) crashing down. Grief makes people do funny things.

If it feels appropriate for your professional relationship, I might gently encourage him to speak to a therapist. He needs and deserves support, but the workplace is not an appropriate place to seek it."
e7jxay,"NTA. She should apologize for making accusations and for ambushing you. She should have asked if you knew what was wrong with the stereo system. Life is stressful - you don’t take it out on others, you ask for help if you need it. Sounds like she took too much on and is stressed out."
e7jzmo,"ESH -- Him for obvious reasons, you for enabling this and then complaining about it. 

Repeat after me: ""No."" 

If he asks the cashier for cigarettes, ""no. Those go on a separate bill."" Then pay for the groceries and leave his ass standing there. 

If he asks for a meal to go from the waitstaff, 'oh, no, that goes on a separate check, thank you.' He can then say nevermind or pay. Up to him. 

Also, don't pay for his divorce lawyer, just yours."

e7k315,"I mean, NAH, not really.  This is a pretty common relationship problem.

You gotta understand...hearing people complain about work is the most annoying thing ever.  A little venting from time to time should be acceptable, but doing it as often as you're describing has obviously made it cross into problematic territory.

But don't tell her that it died from missing her. You don't want to pile guilt on top of her other mental health issues. Either tell her the truth or that it died because it was old or ill. Maybe ask her caretakers what they think she can handle and go from there.

NTA."
e7kl0j,"Well, you've learned your mother won't follow your instructions when she babysits your daughter. So now you know she will do what she wants, not what you ask her to do.

I wouldn't apologize, and I would make other arrangements for babysitting.

e7kpkg,"NTA she didn’t even want any, sounds like she just wanted to complain."
e7ks5d,"NTA

As it was his fake ID (if it was his actual ID I’d be in the other camp)"
e7ksot,"NTA. You have to live your own life and it's not fair for a grown adult man (or men in this case) to ask you to give up your life and become a full-time maid. You can love your family and care about their health and still not be a nursemaid. And your father is old enough to know that it's HIS responsibility to cut down on the junk food. You are not anyone's keeper, and you're allowed to live your own life. So, yeah, 100% NTA."
e7kw9t,NTA if you truly think she's being abused.  If so then you NEED to report.
e7kwga,"NTA

But you can’t control others, you can only control yourself 

This ‘friend’ isn’t a friend, you need to accept this at some point"
e7kzfg,NTA: This is too raw for you. I am sorry for your loss.  Your family needs help. They are TA.
e7l0g5,"NTA. Your wedding, your call."
e7l0yv,"YTA for not giving her *the chance.* Let her take driving lessons with a professional and see how she does. I'm not saying that you or your husband need to put yourselves in danger, but see how she does with an instructor with instructor brakes."
e7l15d,If your gonna drop out do it now.   But nta if you truly feel you can’t.   Your friend might feel bad though
e7l1cn,"YWBTA. What a shitty spot to put your stepmother and half siblings in. You’re, essentially, asking her to choose between hurting your feelings or hurting your fathers. Invite them all or none of them."
e7l2go,NTA. Don’t want to be accused of being homophobic and racist? Don’t be homophobic and racist.
e7l40w,"ESH, but him *way* more.

You need to not be distracting in a standardized test environment. He was right in that it's unfair to the other test-takers.

He overreacted **so, so much.** Like, absurdly so."
e7l48a,"Your kinda the a-hole...

Finding the right combination of antidepressant Rx takes awhile and the wrong combination can make your life hell.  (Source 20+ years of depression.)

Your anger is misplaced.  Yes, this is frustrating, 
but yelling at your Mom is making this far worse.  

Stop.

Talk to her calmly about seeing her doctor. Be objective, focus on working with her to find a solution."
e7l78o,NTA.   They might qualify for some assistance.  Perhaps guide them in that direction.
e7l9as,NAH - it sounds like you're currently towards the end of your turn. He had his turn while you were burnt out making six figures. He'll have to wait until you're making enough to cover another turn for him unless you can rebudget again or something like that
e7lbbb,"Nta 
Welcome to the real world, Jim,  where you can't maintain gainful employment if you can't be depended on to relieve your coworkers at the time on the schedule or ask for a different schedule.  
That's just an entitled move right there and it isn't okay and honestly I'm not sure why his boss can't do anything about it. I sure don't know who else would be expected to handle it. But if someone shrug their shoulders at me that had the power to change it oh, I would do what you are doing, which is protecting yourself and your ability to provide for your own household. I hate that kind of co-worker. I told my boss once that if he fired the people that couldn't be depended on, he could just give me a raise since I was doing half their job anyway. Bs."
e7lbg2,"NTA for being annoyed, but partially YTA for drawing the line in the sand that his girlfriend isn't invited every time.  That just puts everyone in an awkward place, but especially your friend.  When you make it known that you don't care for the type of person his girlfriend is and that you'd rather hang out with just him, then you're forcing him to choose one or the other and it is a lose-lose for him because it is clear that no matter what he chooses, someone will be upset or hurt by his choice.  


I've been the guy in this type of situation before and it is extremely aggravating and can actually cause a lot of damage to both relationships.  I'd say, his girlfriend sucks for being so greedy with his attention, but you could also work on your tolerance level and include her for the health of your friendship and his relationship.  I feel bad for the poor guy lol.  Too much time with that back and forth is a real shit sandwich for a guy."
e7lf7v,"NTA

That said, let's play this out.  You talk to them about gay rights and try to explain that lesbians aren't evil.  Their dad finds out (and he will) and cuts you off.  He will then proceed to tell the kids you're evil and you will never see them again.  In other words, noble but ultimately pointless.

Alternative.  Play the long game.  Nothing you can do about it right now other than be their absolutely best and most awesome aunt.  Don't talk specifically about lesbians but do make sure they know you believe all people are fine as they are.  Then, when they're a bit older and their dad can't control them, you spring the whole ""hey, want to meet this awesome woman I'm dating?"" and open their minds a bit.

Sorry, I know it sucks and I know it must feel horrible to hear your own family talk like this.  I wish I had a better answer."
e7lfyc,"NAH if you do it gently. ""Calling them out"" will accomplish nothing but dividing you further. Telling them you'd like to see more of them and be included in more family events, or want to start a new annual family tradition will accomplish a lot more in the long run."
e7lj34,"Nta, do it"
e7ljxi,"So wait... he cussed at you first, but you cussing back makes you the bad guy?  GIRL, get out of this relationship and fast.  He clearly doesn’t respect you, and it even seems like he wants to control you by putting you into awkward situations you’ll feel pressured under.  

Edit: NTA"
e7llyf,"NTA- you should feel comfortable in your own hone, regardless!"
e7lnee,"NTA. 

That dude is an asshole. 

I would have been all about having someone help me. 

I’m better now tho, my husband got me a chopsticks buddy! And I’m actually getting the hang of it lol"
e7lni8,"ESH, but him way more. You stubbornly argued your incorrect point instead of just looking it up immediately, but he ***WAY*** the fuck overreacted."
e7lqtj,"ESH while him more, why the hell did you tell your daughter that? Deal with your adult problems with out involving them like that"
e7lsos,"NTA obviously. It’s your day and she’s trying to make it about her. She *is* right about this setting the tone for your marriage in that, if you gave in to her here, she’d expect you to keep giving in to her for the rest of her life.

e7ltup,"I feel like we’re verging into the territory of blaming a child for their parents poor decisions. I get you, if I received that request I would be taken aback but if the child is asked directly what they want and they take that list verbatim then it’s no ones fault. Poor children see the same things children of stable parents do, they are advertised to just as heavily. You sound incredibly bitter and I can kind of get that too, I’m in my 30s and very much want kids but am waiting to be more financially sound and it irritates me to no end when I see peers having their umpteenth child with seemingly no thought to being able to support them financially or emotionally. Poverty and unequal access to education is an exhausting cycle. But it’s not the kids fault for being born to those parents. I don’t think you would be the asshole for not getting the game controller, but if you can swing it financially, why not? I imagine he experiences a lot of disappointment on the regular. You chose to do this to give a child a Christmas, not make a stance against this agency and their practices or irresponsible parents."
e7lu3j,Yes. She will die from that disease and you wouldn't want your grandkids to skip out on seeing you. Go and see her. It will not kill you to do something nice for a sick person to whom you are related.
e7lzn1,"NTA if everything went down as you said.

-you were offered $25 to rake the yard

-your mother helped, without you asking

-she complained the whole time

-but refused to go inside

-then she wants the money that she ""earned?""

yeah no, she sounds awful."
e7m0tk,"NTA but her friends are. You're wife was clearly fine with it, and her friends are inserting themselves into a situation that doesn't concern them."
e7m14u,"she figured out pretty quickly that he would rather receive love in the form of cute plans and food and acted accordingly. she also made it very clear how she would like to be shown love, she didn't say ""i want you to get me gifts occasionally"" she very specifically requested flowers or chocolate once a month. given the explicit nature of her request I don't see how this would be hard for someone who doesn't enjoy giving gifts to do. you don't need to ""find a middle ground"" because you dont both have to receive love in the same form. 

If i was your boyfriend i would have put the pieces together that since you are always giving me cute gifts you would probably enjoy them in return and i DEFINITELY would've put it together after you out right told me you would. for sure NTA. you should look up the 5 love languages, might shed some light on how you both feel."
e7m164,NTA. You can’t afford it and you want to do something more personal for her.
e7m4np,"NAH

I think it's understandable that your new wife feels insecure about this sort of thing, as well as the fact that you no longer associate the song with your ex wife. It really boils down to how much good it does for you to continue singing this song versus how much pain it inflicts on your wife. The fact that you only associate the song with Jodie has no bearing on the situation. Fact is, the song reminds your WIFE of your EX, and you're singing that song to your new child. The connotations here are pretty sticky.

Pick a new song for your new kid. It also serves to keep the first song special for Jodie."
e7m5iw,"YTA and so is your mum. Not for putting him down, if that's what he needed, but for not including your sister in that conversation, or even letting her know that it was what was happening. 


Knowing that he was going to pass away there and being okay with that is very different from saying ""yes, schedule to put him down and don't tell me when""."
e7mdh7,"NTA, but I recommend going. I feel like not seeing someone one last time before their death when you could always bothers people. So I recommend going, but you're not an asshole if you don't want to."
e7mfns,"NTA, she is awful and hurt you in so many ways."
e7mif7,"NTA. Your SO lives with toxic parents (if you can even call them that.) and need a break with them. Btw, link her to r/insaneparents and she'll maybe gain some karma."
e7mlc5,"Definitely NTA. It's not your job to wash other people's dishes, and the fact that you even wash your own while you're there instead of leaving them in the sink like everyone else makes you DEFINITELY not an asshole."
e7mm2q,"YTA of course you did wrong. Not only did you not complete that task, you flat out admitted you had other work to do. No one asked you to put up the decorations. You aren't paid to decorate the office. You are paid to do your job. So do it and don't ask us AITA when you don't do your job because you are."
e7mpes,"YTA - It's Santa Rule #1: when you find out, don't shit on it for everyone else. You absolutely should have made clear to your son to keep his mouth shut."
e7mq0y,"YTA because you didn’t tell him what you wanted and then you got mad at him for not doing what you wanted. He’s not a mind reader. If you want to do something special for your anniversary, talk about it! Plan something ahead of time or be clear the day of about what you want to do. 

He kinda sucks for inviting his friend over on your anniversary but he probably thought you didn’t care about doing much for your anniversary so it wasn’t a big deal. 

Side note: I noticed you mentioning not getting your hopes up about him *finally* proposing... you need to talk to him about this if you haven’t already. If marriage is an expectation of yours, you’re going to need to be clear about that with him. You don’t want to end up sitting around for 8 more years, never getting proposed to if getting married is what you want to do. 

He may not want to get married, he may not think you guys need to get married after being together for so long, maybe he’s waiting to ask you, maybe he’s never thought about it. Who knows what the case is here? But you need to communicate your wishes to him."
e7mtgq,"NTA, also if this happens often please see a doctor."
e7myas,YTA I don’t think you understand the meaning of “unintentionally”. You intentionally both made fun of her beliefs and terrified her.
e7mz4u,"Nta - she is taking advantage of you being willing to accommodate her to begin with. Condo association isn't going to tell you to walk on egg shells during normal living hours. It isn't like you can levitate and it also isn't like you walk like an elephant. You are doing nothing wrong, op."
e7mzh8,NTA- you reap what you sow.
e7n0bh,"1) you guys have TOO MANY DOGS, there is no way that many dogs are getting the proper care. And you have a husky puppy?

e7n2fu,"NTA - I lied about my faith at work for years. When you're an atheist in Texas, it's just what you do. Ironically, it was my first job at a Christian bookstore that finally pushed me into atheism, but that's beside the point. 

Bottom line is, you sound like you're really sort of caught between religions and you're perfectly okay for giving yourself space to figure it out. She's the asshole for acting like it's black or white and putting you choose on the spot. It's none of her damn business."
e7n43h,"NTA he's being incredibly insensitive for not understanding how racist calling a ceremony ""tribal"" sounds."
e7n4gi,"I'm an atheist. In the Army, I wore a headscarf in some Afghan villages out of respect for their culture. If you're just doing it so no one sees your dyed hair, YTA. Probably. Particularly because you have a choice to dye your hair, knowing that you'd probably have to sit those classes out."
e7n6yo,"ESH. The way you said it I think was a jerk move. Sounded accusatory and like there was no trust or faith in the relationship. I think she’s TA for ghosting you though. That sounds really weird. Even if you were right, still ESH."
e7n742,"NTA. You have to eat.  
You are not ordering takeout delivered.  You are bringing leftovers.  Not too sure about coworkers trying to guilt you though."
e7n7ml,"This really isn't an AITA question, is it.

Look into temporarily deferring your student loans. They will still accrue interest but in my experience, they will let you take a short term deferment for just about anything. Maybe that might help the situation."
e7n8px,"If there is an agreement to share these things then y ta. 

You would be better to talk to her about it, maybe she just likes the songs and cant be bothered creating a new one.

Maybe ask her if it can be renamed so its not so obvious what its for.

Although while it is an A move you could always add a few extra songs... I've heard baby shark really sets the mood."
e7n8uh,Then NTA. You should talk to him about how uncomfortable it makes you.

e7ne6m,NTA - some of the rules are ridiculous.

You should have had this conversation with your boyfriend before posting.

He should have okayed the post THEN stood behind you if any shit came from it.

If he is not fully out then anything you post about you two needs to be fully approved by him."
e7ni4s,"I agree with everyone else that you’re NTA. But I will add, and I don’t mean this is a bad way, that if weight gain means you’ve lost your attraction to him, maybe you shouldn’t be together? For a relationship to work long-term you should probably be able to get past a change in appearance. Though of course, this still doesn’t make you TA. If he doesn’t have any motivation to lose weight and you’re at the point where you can’t even enjoy sex with him, it’s probably not worth staying together imo."

This sort of behavior from a parent is always a precursor to the parent trying to take your money.

Prove with a paycheck stub that you are making your money legally.  Otherwise you mom is welcome to piss off."
e7nkf5,"NTA, my sisters used to do the same thing, always plan on going to a restaurant or the movies and always “forgot there wallet”, it’s your money so you can choose not to go."
e7nlxt,"I totally get that. I do think I was unintentionally an asshole and couldn't believe myself. It made me wonder if I had spread myself too thin over too many friends, failed to be a good friend to all of them, and realized it too late in the worst way."
e7nmij,"NTA. You weren't, at the time, dating, which gives him no input into this decision."
e7nno6,NTA. A true friend doesn't steal the spotlight at another friend's event. If she wanted to have a dinner to announce it at that would have been for her to host. Stop chasing her.
e7novc,NTA. I hate group projects for this very reason.
e7npl2,"NTA, jesus. Quit the damn job if what you are saying is even remotely true."
e7nq69,NTA personally when meeting people I met online for the first time I always want a public place. If money is his excuse offer to treat him to coffee maybe. That way he doesn’t need to worry and you can get more of the first date vibe you wanted.
e7nqmp,"NTA, the pill is for both of you, you’re just the only one who has to take it. I’d probably find someone else to sleep with too"
e7nsp8,"NAH. Your question was not out of line, and the reply was not out of line either. I don’t read the reply as a personal attack because it was not about you. The reply was “not everyone has privilege.” That is not the same as singling you out by saying “you, OP, are privileged.” These people may have no idea that you get money from family for Christmas."
e7nt8t,"NTA not to sound horrible but , they need to realise that there are other people living around them and just because their child is autistic doesn’t exclude him from the rules , 6 months is a long time , especially since you pay to live there andyou have to put up with that"
e7nu5i,"NTA

He sounds very entitled. And I suspect that you are right in that if you lend it to him you will never see it again."
e7num5,NTA. A parent should never hold the cost of raising children against their kids.
e7nwsr,"NAH. It's understandable for him to be sad, but you really shouldn't feel bad for having prior paid-for plans that involve other people. YWBTA if you cancelled on your friends that are going with you to the market for inconveniencing them. Your birthday bud will get over it, sometimes schedules just don't align."
e7nz4t,"NAH, I agree that it sucks and seems kind of dumb, it’s the same at my job.  But from the company’s perspective, they are paying you to be there so they want to get their money’s worth."
e7o08m,YTA.  You could not be bothered to spend 10 minutes to help a whole heap of people. You may get good grades and a star pupil. But you are a lousy team member.
e7o0xf,And yet step dad and his ex were perfectly ok with it when it was OP's son getting the shaft; now that the situation's reversed it's suddenly unfair to the step daughter?!
e7o2bv,ESH Sheesh. Both of you should have picked up the cans. Don't be so juvenile.
e7o343,"Honestly, it sounds like his love language is different from yours. I suggest y’all take the quiz together and figure out how to best show the other your love. That being said NAH, you are entitled to your feelings as he his. He wanted to show his love by buying you things and possibly wanted to make sure you like them. Some people don’t pick up on clues and want to be told what to get and do. Maybe in the future, give a list and then he can pick."
e7o38b,Shitpost. What does it have to do with you?
e7o4lw,ESH.  Her for two-timing your cousin.  You for not insisting that she break up with him before you and she got serious.   Your cousin for cheating on her.  Ugh.
e7o5u1,yta. if you are canceling for the 3rd time in a row you dont have the time for dnd and should drop out of the group.

e7o8gm,"NTA - they’re not your partner anymore though, you broke up with them."
e7ob4x,"NTA, OP. And this situation really sucks. I think they completely disrespected your budget, constantly misquoting prices without notifying you when the prices became more expensive. Save your money. Spend Christmas with your friends and dog. Buy yourself something nice and still save 1500+."

e7ol2z,"Was there a reason why your mom is so against your uncle living with your grandma? If there isn't any specific reason, your mom sounds like (sorry) TA here, like a pretty big one."
e7oncl,"NTA, NTA, NTA! It's your property, not his. Christmas lights are even a fairly non-religious part of Christmas! It's not even as though you have a manger out or anything (although that's still perfectly fine!) This is completely absurd.

Edit: everyone saying Y-T-A has some good points, except:

>We both have around 3 acres each

I live on 3 acres, and can confirm that this shouldn't really be an issue. 3 acres is a lot, and even though I'm in the front third of the 3 acres, I never hear car noise at all."
e7opdz,man I don't know this is really gray area all I want to say is that if you're going to play a vengeance paladin then you don't want to piss off the DM because he can pretty much at any point yank your powers.
e7or42,"YTA   I get not wanting your kids to walk in on that, but the kids need to learn boundaries as well.  Restricting adult content in someone else's home is ridiculous.  Even FROZEN is PG. 

 What if you ban adult content and then your kids walk in on them having sex or talking about something not kid friendly? Pretty soon your girls are probably going to have sleepovers with their friends.  This seems like it could be more of a teaching moment.  

You brought your concerns to the in-laws and they offered a decent solution...setting up a don't leave the bedroom rule.  I get kids need to be able to leave for certain situations, bathroom etc. But why were they out and about in the first place?"
e7ose8,"NTA in the least. They sound awful and incredibly inconsiderate. Get some better roommates that don't sacrifice your comfort, sleep, and happiness."
e7ot0j,"Yta. Unless you’re watching a movie with him, this isn’t your business."
e7ot64,"NTA. She's the guest, she needs to adapt if she's inconveniencing you."
e7oxeo,"YTA, but in a typical “angsty teenager” kind of way. 

There is a very obvious reason why they want to limit your screen time & social media at or near bed time. Sleep! You may not realize it, but getting enough sleep as a teenager (well, as a child and an adult as well) is critical to your physical & mental health, and the screen light has been proven to disrupt your sleep for quite a while after you actually shut down. Plus, being attached to social media notifications all night long is not only unnecessary, it’s really unhealthy from a mental health standpoint. 

You don’t have to like their rules or even understand their rules, but “no phone after 9 pm” is certainly not unreasonable. You’re 15- they’re quite certainly paying for your phone/plan, and they 100% have the right (& responsibility) to set limits."
e7oxsh,"It's not your fault that he is a mess. Most likely he is only threatening self harm to manipulate you.

e7p3y1,it's just weird
e7p6ee,"You need a new neurologist, most people with Tourette syndrome do not have vocal tics but uncontrollable neck and body tics like you described. That is probably why the medicine works. Many advancements have been made in the last 5 years and you should be re-evaluated."
e7p6xk,Seriously?! I would have disputed the bill and not left a tip. NTA. Bitching about a tip to a customer is considered rude even here in the US. I would never look at tip before someone leaves.
e7p9qv,"Your parent is giving you, a grown ass adult, the SILENT TREATMENT?

Fuck that. 

You are NTA and your parent will need to work on transitioning from the role of parent who tells you what to do, to being in an adult to adult relationship with you.

If they cant sort that out, they will find themselves very far removed from your life."
e7pavb,"NTA - You have corrected her multiple times, after that it's not forgetfulness it's disrespect. Don't be friends with people who don't respect you."
e7phf1,"NTA, with caveats.  I don’t think relocating is going to solve these problems.  Your husband is not willing to put you and your son first where his mother is involved.   You briefly mention that she provides your childcare. That’s HUGE. Perhaps your husband sees this enormous gift and feels he owes mom a bit more?  

Geography may stop random stop overs, but pressure for money, guilt, requests for help— those will reach you anywhere.  Those won’t stop until your husband makes them stop."
e7pkou,"NTA

Because that's what this is."
e7pp5b,NTA.  Go for it!
e7pwm6,"YTA. You had zero right to get mad at your friend for pursuing the girl you liked after you threw away your chance, and you're certainly an asshole for being with your current girlfriend when you like someone else.

Dude, you literally decided not to tell her you liked her, and you started dating someone else. Neither of your friends have done anything wrong and you're just bitter."

e7pyxa,"NAH

Mind reading and telepathy do not exist. You didn’t tell, he didn’t ask."
e7q2ys,"NTA -- you were the nearest adult. He needs to follow instructions from all relevant adults, not just his ""parents"". You gave a clear and understandable instruction. You were teaching him an important life lesson. I would hardly call that disciplining. 

All your aunt is doing is teaching him that he doesn't have to obey anyone but her and your uncle. That's not going to work if they ever use a babysitter. That's not going to work for when he gets into school. Doling out punishments should be left to the parents for in home discipline issues, but giving corrections should be allowed by the nearest adult."
e7q416,"NAH. I can see why you're upset. You worked hard to get him a nice gift you thought he would appreciate. Nobody wants to see their gift regifted, especially if you thought you got something they would really like. But your boyfriend did something very nice. I'm sure he would much more have preferred to eat it, and I don't think he was trying to disrespect you or your gift. He just saw someone who needed it more than him."

e7qaxi,"NTA. You don't have any obligation, you weren't close, and the paid entry thing is weird af."
e7qcvg,NTA. You tried to handle it in private. She brought the public eye on the argument. She may or may not think oils works. I dunno. But I do know its pretty likely she said it would help with specifically the things her grandma has to get her to buy them. Thats scummy af. Good for you for protecting your grandma

e7qsmr,"I think YTA, but lots of this is about your phrasing. ""She needs to eat less food"" is super judgemental, and if she's at the bottom of a healthy weight range, then she's not really overeating. It does sound like she has a bit of an unhealthy relationship with food, but just telling her to eat less won't fix that. And the getting winded thing is most likely a fitness issue that doesn't have anything to do with how much she's eating."
e7qsul,"NTA. You couldn't have known. You were trying to get paid your worth, and an old gentleman's agreement got in the way. If business relations are severed, that's the companies' problem. Not yours."

e7qtql,"NTA- But I don't think he's mad about the lawnmower, I think he's mad about the principal of it. You don't return an item broken, and I completely understand that he might be mad on that. Or he's projecting his stress on the lawnmower being broken. Just try to reason with him"
e7qv2t,NTA -- you came up with a reasonable alternative.
e7qv77,"NTA, I'd feel very uncomfortable doing anything in a person's home without their consent."

e7r348,"You're not only NTA but you're an example to all of us who work from home. It's way harder to self manage time and distractions than have the surrounding colleagues and bosses keep you on track. 

You've got a way that works for you and you should feel no guilt or shame or anything about that. As you say, if it's urgent, someone will phone. She needs to grow up and realise that the presence of a boss doesn't dictate that you need to concentrate for work."
e7r46o,"NTA - what are you supposed to do, never tell her and just conceal your pregnancy? You told her privately so she had opportunity to take it in and I can see why it’s upsetting for her but in no way does your pregnancy affect her chances of getting pregnant so there’s no reason for her to be upset with you. 

Congratulations!"
e7r4qu,"NTA.

Sounds like you're a fan. You already bought tickets to the show. Sounds like they're ungrateful asshole celebs."

Get that money back that she lent you though, and threaten her with small claims court if you have proof that she promised to pay you back."

e7roe0,"NAH. The man needs a place to stay. You and your children deserve to have access to the public park without feeling uncomfortable. 

This situation sucks. It’s a governmental problem though. There’s not enough aid for the homeless. 

I’m non confrontational so I probably would’ve gone to another park. But I don’t think you’re an ass hole for calling the police. I just hope he was taken to a homeless shelter he could stay at.

Maybe you could take your children to a homeless shelter to give back for the holidays. This way they know to not look down on others, and it also might make you feel less guilty. (Even if you shouldn’t)"
e7ruz7,"NTA, he's a creep.

Hope you reported him to security."
e7rvj3,"YTA with good intentions. If a girl is feeling insecure about something you tell her she’s beautiful and reassure her. Instead, you came up with a plan to “fix” her area of insecurity. 

To a girl, that screams “he sees it too” and makes her even more insecure. And upset. 

It would be different if she suggested it, or if she were unhealthy or seriously overweight. But she’s not. So yeah, you kind of fucked up here.

It’s just a disconnect. She came to you with a “problem” so you wanted to find her a solution. All she wanted was reassurance."
e7rze3,"YTA. I would say YTA but it's cus you don't realise what it looks like... You make it look and sound like like getting gifts for people is a huge inconvenience but you do it anyway for the social norm. 

Just for the record, sending a gift straight to their house and not wrapping it to save ""time and money"" is not very Christmas.. and the most likely consequence is that they might feel like your enthusiasm in their relationship is not reciprocated. Wrapping paper costs like £1/$1!"
e7s01i,"Yta she tried to compromise by having you go to her parents and you straight up said no, then after she made plans you tried to backtrack and got angry at her then accuse her behaviour of being toxic."

Dont send them along in new clothes, send them only in their older clothes so he wont try and keep them, thats something lots of divorced parents do with these type of assholish parents.

He sounds utterly like a child himself"
e7s6oa,"NTA. You are never required to attend an event you are not comfortable with.  Full Stop. There may be a consequence in the form of a lack of acceptance from that peer group but you don't have to go.

e7s9i5,"YTA

LA has plenty of public transportation options. I didn't have a car when I visited and I took the LA Light Rail and the buses everywhere. My partner and I managed to get around without any issues. If your mother is paying for the car and she doesn't want you to drive it, it's her call. If it's in your brother's name, why not just let him drive? If you have other issues with your mom refusing to lend you money when you were in trouble, you should talk to her about it."
e7s9u1,"NTA. She's being horrendously hypocritical.
If she doesn't like it she can stay elsewhere. It might teach her some responsibility!"
e7sdmt,Couples counselling. The car sounds like the least of your issues. NTA
e7sg6m,"YTA - stop getting bothered about something so small. Your reaction was totally disproportionate and uncalled for. 

I suggest an apology and just ignore small things that bother you. 

You’ll never survive in a work place or serious long term relationship with this kind of attitude or response."
e7sg90,"NTA - because I think she should wait until she's 18 to decide this.  I begged to have my nose done as a teenager all the goddamn time, low and behold I'm now an adult who's never even thought about it again until I saw this post."
e7skkd,"NAH - you have a month to reply. You know your mind and that you’re likely to change your mind etc. So you did what works for you.

e7sn9e,"YTA. You sound surprisingly spoiled for a pregnant high school dropout. How do you barely look pregnant at 5 months and a month goes by and you’re already ‘huge’ with mobility issues? You probably also expect her to financially support you when the baby arrives - did you work out how you’ll pay for anything once your bf goes to college?  Think of watching the kids as the price you pay to live in the house. If you don’t feel comfortable bathing the boy (9 years old is too old to be bathed by a teenager IMO) talk with the mother about it and work something out. 

You don’t sound mature enough to be a mother. I also call BS on doing poorly at school because of your hormones. Get your shit together, you’ve only got a few more months before someone else’s life is 100% your responsibility, sounds like you can barely take care of yourself.

Edited: Initially thought ‘9M’ was 9 months, not 9 male. I’m in too many online baby groups."
e7spwk,"Nta.      It’s your money,   She shouldn’t be charging anything to you without asking.      Don’t try to parent your moms money usage,  she is an adult.  But no, she doesn’t get access to your money."

She cheated on you man. Have some pride and never talk to her again.

Harsh but true. 

Going back to an ex is like digging in the trash for a meal.

I love my two daughters so much, but if I could do it all over again, I wouldn't be a mom. It is still a big taboo to admit that having children isn't the most amazing thing in the world, but for a lot of us, the lows far outweigh the highs. I'd never ever tell my kids I feel this way, but I think this is something you should be able to be honest about with you partner in marriage counselling, and the fact she *told your child* this is disgusting.

No offence but if you're always the one who needs to make an active effort to keep in touch and to hang out else you're left in the dark you weren't really friends in the first place, more like conveniently there together. As with any relationship it needs to be a two-way street. Sad truth is that life happens, people who you were once close with can drift apart."
e7t80c,NAH. I could see turning it down it in a 10 year marriage but not with a 2 year girlfriend. Just because she wants to leave town doesn’t mean you are required to.  It would be nice to tell her so she can figure out what she wants to do. You could be broken up in 6 months and regretting a decision that insures your future financial security.
e7tcxy,NTA you should definetly tell him.
e7td46,"Why not? Does everybody have to jump off their machine, interrupt their workout and wait while this guy does his thing?"
e7tgp7,"NAH - but it's not your house. You don't get to choose whether or not a hook belongs on the wall. Clean up if you want, but others don't have to do the same. When you get your own place, you can keep it the way you want it. Also, maybe start looking into what it'll take to get your own place... perhaps put your free time into that."
e7tj4l,"Approach her calmly but sternly and say "" I will not communicate with you until you can speak to me in a respectful, calm way. If you cannot treat me like a respectable adult, which I am, I will not be able to properly communicate with you.""

I had to do this with my mom, I would still call her and attempt to keep a relationship but the second she was disrespectful, condescending, or rude in any way I would repeat that phrase. If she continued with her behavior I would simply hang up. If she was able to correct her behavior we would continue our conversation. It took almost 2 years, but now we have an adult relationship where she knows to respect me and my decisions 

NTA"
e7u34a,"Not an asshole for hating them, but YTA if you don't do them. The way I see it is, someone had to remember to buy, send and address a card, or even just venmo the thing, the least you can do is take a few minutes to send the note.

But!! You don't have to super customize each one (no one is comparing thank yous), and I think it's ok to type and print it - - maybe with a little note that says ""sorry it's typed, my arthritis is acting up!) and then just sign them. Done and done."
e7u4o0,NTA. What they did was incredibly rude and controlling. What time you get up is none of their business.
e7u5o8,"Any chance that you could refund the cost they paid? It sounds like they probably aren’t prepared to perform at all, but it would be shitty to kick them off after they’ve paid. If you can refund them, NTA"
e7u80z,"NTA. My father actually did a very similar thing to me. He and my mother gave me 50% of an investment property (the one I was living in at the time). Years later my parents went through a very messy 4 year long divorce. My father claimed they had never given it to me, despite my name being on the papers. He took me to court. I could have fought it, but I wanted the divorce to be over. He still thinks he never did anything wrong.

It’s not fair and it never will be. But sometimes money turns people into completely different persons. I love my dad but I’ll never forget how he betrayed me. There’s just some trust that can’t be recovered after something like this happens. Push the issue with your dad if you want. Just know that he may have already convinced himself that he doesn’t actually owe you anything."
e7uipq,"NAH but I’d consider what he’s saying. Most people hide their bags simply because the bag contains fecal
 matter and when out, especially at places to eat, it’s considerate to keep it hidden under clothing."
e7ujrz,"YTA but gently, I understand your fears of them doing those things but if you’re going to choose to be friends with people and date people who partake in those things then you can’t freak out while they’re doing it. Especially if they’re doing acid, you freaking out could really damage their trip and put them in a bad place"
e7ukmg,"NTA, your boss has no backbone. Making a sweeping policy change and alienating an experienced employee over one dumb customer complaint is stupid. You owe your boss nothing."

But anyways NTA"
e7uxgp,"YTA. Peeing on the seat is gross. Not refilling the water, and leaving dirty pot(s) or dishes is inconsiderate and irritating. And it sounds like you make a habit of this sort of behaviour so I understand why she would get upset. 

She sounds perfectly reasonable, and adult to me. You sound jealous, childish and inconsiderate. This honestly sounds like a shitpost."
e7uzlp,"NAH. 

You should do what you know will keep you healthy. You know your body best.

Be considerate of her feelings though. You should explain to her that it’s not because you don’t like it, it’s strictly because of you counting calories and sticking to a meal plan."
e7v4hn,"NTA. Also, just get some damn poopourri for that bathroom. It really does make a difference.

Goddamn, you can really tell which nurses were and weren’t CNAs by how much they bitch about poop."

e7vjox,"I dont think you're ta but she probably isnt doing it intentionally. I look at lights, moving object, whatever flashes in my line of vision. If someone is texting and I can see it without trying to look I'm just gonna look. I do try not to but if I'm not actively thinking ""dont look"" then I'm going to end up looking. Lol I'm really adhd though so idk if she is or maybe she is just nosey. Its understandable to feel uncomfortable just consider that not everyone brain works the same as yours does and it probably doesn't occur to her right away what shes doing. I mean youre both 14, self awareness isnt really something either have you have fine tuned. NAH imo"
e7vqau,"NTA.  I don’t think the religion part is an issue, or saying god loves you. But telling your friends personal stuff? That’s a breach."
e7vtuh,"YTA (but only a little bit). The ""nontraditional"" isn't really the problem. It's the construction with the implied ""but"" that's the problem. You basically said that you enjoyed it *despite* being nontraditional. Seems like you meant (and should have said) that you enjoyed it *because* it was nontraditional. Something like ""thanks for the great meal. It was so nice to have something nontraditional instead of boring old turkey"" would have been an actual compliment. Yours ended up sounding very backhanded even though that wasn't your intention."

The other option is to be factual. “She watched my child and kept him safe.”   There a lot to be said for what isn’t said."
e7w74h,"NTA. You can ask her not to copy it, and I don't think that would make you an asshole -

BUT honestly I would just ignore it, let her get her ripoff tattoo (ugh, unoriginal tat designs are *the worst*), and have your bomb artist nail the art, and get your tattoo anyway. In the end, what is asking her not to get it really going to do besides cause friction? She'll have (what I assume is another) meaningless tattoo she impulsively decided on, and you'll still have a thought out piece with significant meaning behind it. To me, it's not worth the trouble. *Everything* is inspired by something, just let this go."

e7wio5,"nah, its understandable for you to be hurt by this but keep in mind shes in a whole other country that she might never get the chance to explore again, let her enjoy her time abroad"
e7wjtl,"NAH, but I think you need therapy. You talk a lot about how you *know* what your father feels, what you can see in his eyes. But you don't really know unless you ask him. This could very well be more in your head than in his. You remember a conversation, but who knows how serious he was about that and if he changed his mind now that he is in this situation? These thoughts you describe sound pretty on point for someone with depression, actually, and meds don't fix all of that."
e7wkpo,"NTA. You were standing up for your sister, and that's a very good thing of you to do. When I was learning/fluent in French, I would use random French words in everyday conversation.

Hopefully she can respect your boundaries, as petty as they may seem"

This isn't all that different then if you had lunch next door and ordered it. And as long as you didn't demand full bakery access when the online store only had limited menu. It shouldn't be a problem.

e7wpy2,NTA people drift apart and if you don’t feel comfortable reaching out that’s ok. If she feels like she wants your support she can ask
e7wqfq,"YTA but not for the reason you think. 

It sounds like she's in a psychologically abusive relationship. The reason many people don't leave is because they feel they don't have support from their friends and family. The right thing to do would have been to support her - she clearly KNOWS people don't like him... Why did you pile on?

If you're good friends, you just cut one of her ties outside of an abusive relationship. If you're acquaintances, you should have minded your own business.

Ultimately all you did was upset her and kick her while she's down: she knows everyone hates him."

e7wyy4,"YWBTA if you lied about being gay. Its a sexuality, not something to use to make someone angry. Also you might come across as immature and affirm their opinion about you if you say it too spiteful and shiz. I can understand though, the petty revenge side of it.

e7x6jc,"YTA. The intention was good but they're right. You *really* should have discussed this with them. It'd be one thing if we're talking about a guitar or something, but drums are fucking *loud*. This gift is going to affect everyone in the house and also potentially the neighbours. On top of that a drumset takes up a pretty significant amount of space. It's fine to want to spoil your niece, but a drumset is one of those things that you really need to run by the parents."

e7yr9e,"ESH

She was 17 when she moved in, so you forced your lifestyle on a teenager and expected that to go well. No nonveg food, even in her own room doesn't give any room for living her own life, so she probably already hated you for it. Obviously what she did was over the line but it sounds like you both had problems with each other and it wasn't going to fix itself.

She's an adult now and it's your house, but I think it's illegal to kick someone out with no notice if they've lived there for two years. There were probably half measures to take that would be less extreme.

You disrespected her nonveg lifestyle way before she disrespected yours.

Edit: everyone calling her an evil stepmother, can you imagine having a teenage girl who disagrees with your ethical choices living in your house for two years? We only read about this one snapshot of events but there was probably escalation on *both* sides leading up to this.

Edit: if one more person comments that paying rent is required to make you a tenant, I swear. It depends on where they live, but all 50 states have tenants rights and you don't have to pay rent for that, you just have to call it home. You can't just kick people out like a fucking rom-com."

You have been together for two years. You're closer to 30 than 20. It is past time to start thinking about what you life looks like in the future, and that includes whether or not you want this girl to be there. Stop 'what if'ing yourself and MAKE PLANS.

Do NOT offer your friend $10k.  She may take that as an admission that she is right and she you for the remainder.  Instead, tell her you won the money, but you understand her upset.

1) your relationship was different then. Partners tend to support each other through sudden hardships. That isn’t the situation now.

It's, and I mean this with sincere respect, a selfish way to look at gift giving. 

I'm a strict minimalist like your husband. My family has come to a pretty nice compromise: any present they gift me comes with the receipt. If I decide I'd rather have the store credit, then I can take it to the store and get it.

It should also state what will happen if either party wants to end the contract early.) I’ve only done freelancing for a few thousand at a time at most, so hardly amounts I’m likely to sue over (especially friends and family), but just the act of openly discussing expectations and how each person will handle themselves REALLY helps avoid conflict down the line. If the other person won’t engage in that talk, run."

(Don't managers get paid more than laborers? hmm...)

This isn't an advice sub, but I would suggest that you two sit down together once or twice and list out all the things that have to get done in general. Maybe you can find a nice even way to split it up, so one of you is in charge of *everything* related to laundry, or bathroom, or kitchen, or cleaning, maybe sharing some key tasks like keeping rooms picked up or laundry or shopping, or dividing by days instead of tasks, however the division works best for you two. It's possible bf has never even thought about things in this way, so you're giving him a crash course on everything that needs to be done, once, so he can learn once and for all, ask questions then, and have no excuses later. 

That way, gf and bf agree once on everything they each need to do, and from that point on, gf can expect bf to handle *all* of his part. After like two weeks you can check in again, see if everything was done, if something needs to be redistributed or clarified, and then do that going forward.

Send her an email and see if she'll let you take it.""

I tried to tell him that wouldn't work because the syllabus stated that nothing will be made up without an excused absence. I emailed her anyways and she opened it back up for me saying I'd only get half credit (so basically 5 instead of 10 pts for a 100).

Your mom might be softer on him because she feels so bad for him - he will never lead a 'typical' life, and will miss out on a lot of things.  He may not show it, but he is struggling with life.  He may be jealous of you, if he has that level of awareness, and this might be what your mom sees - that you're lucky to lead a typical life and your brother has to watch  you  do it.  However, your mom should do more to protect you.  You should not have to put up with his bad behavior. She might think that you can handle it though.  If my son came to me and told me he was upset with his brothers behavior, I would take that very seriously.  Try to talk to her, and see what happens.  Wish you the best..."

From a moral/philosophical standpoint I absolutely agree. But weddings are difficult to plan at the best of times, and I would not hold it against you for wanting to respect the money and effort thus far.

So how about this: include some context in the wedding. Take a moment to acknowledge what occurred on that land, perhaps make a donation to an organization that works with less privileged black kids and encourage your guests to do the same. Consult with local black community leaders about respectful ways to give back, if what you're feeling is that you're taking away."

Look, let's not kid around here: listening to people have sex is entirely different from listening to a loud conversation. It's a window into what is otherwise a private and intimate event.

They have been super inconsiderate of you, which is why they are also TA here, but just because you are content to put in earbuds (seriously, I don't know how people can sleep with those in) doesn't mean everyone is. You need to communicate, which you have so far refused to do. 

Incidentally, stop writing off the discomfort around hearing sex (or you hearing them) as people being old-fashioned, because that is rude and disingenuous. I'm a very sex-positive person, but I respect that not everyone has the same level of comfort that I do, and I would not have the gall to assume that my way was the only way that wasn't ""sad""."
e8g5o5,"ESH, but mostly you.  you're taking them on her weekend and making her pick them up because you have more important things to do then drive your kids home. The question isn't should you pay. The question is, is it really the hill you want to die on when your ex is allowing you to have them on her weekend. Pay her the $5 and thank her for sacrificing time with the so they could be there. Be the bigger person. You know what? I bet she would even love a 5x7 or 8x10 of them all dressed up in their wedding best. Be a father first and a petty ex never. If she wants to be petty, let her.

You can say my house, my rules and be justified. But the drug testing, the over one month groundings, and the isolation from his social group seems too much. But from personal experience, all my friends that had parents like you ended up on some really heavy shit. Couple aren't with us anymore. 

You know, it's not a hard leap of faith for a kid to move on to drugs that get out of his system much faster. The real dangerous ones.

What is wrong with people wanting to spend time with you and celebrate who you are?? 

It’s not that you were an asshole to the people that did this for you, but maybe you were an asshole to yourself. You shouldn’t be looking at your birthday like that. You could have had a really good time and it’s not often that a bunch of people will want to come together and do something that you like like that. 

Maybe take this time to re-think that your birthday is not as much a marker for how you’ve been progressing but more of a celebration of your life. 

You kind of sabotaged a wonderful opportunity for fun and being with loved ones for somewhat self-hating and self-critical reasons. 

In a sense, it’s kind of really selfish and just negative."

e8l8aj,ESH.  She sucks for wanting to cheat and you suck for saying you would help her.
e8l9h6,"YWTA. It's freaking 8 years of hard work, he would surely like to see his loved ones around.   
You sound super grumpy with the idea of going from the kick-start, however maybe it's worthy to be TA because otherwise, you might be an EPIC TA going AND being pouty the whole time."
e8ldzk,"NTA You have some issues to work out with babies, but I don't think that bringing a one month old to a concert is a great idea."
e8lg0u,NTA: he proved it when he called you a POS after borrowing a charger for two weeks.
e8lj5g,"Have you considered the reactions of your older children? 

I get the nanny works for you, but perhaps your older children are tired or just tired of not going home after school and they just want to be at home or something. Have you asked? Have you talked to them?"
e8lkbh,"YTA because you aren't twelve. If you are old enough to be married, you are old enough to realize that birthdays are not a big deal. You can celebrate your birthday when he gets back.  He can't go ice fishing with his family every weekend. Get together with a friend or your family on your birthday and have your husband treat you to something special when he gets back. Also, the passive aggressive way you approached the issue sounds exhausting."
e8lmaw,"NTA. Her punishment has gone over the edge into abuse/neglect territory. I think you probably could have phrased your feedback more constructively, but this is a 9-year-old. I get that he should face consequences, but there is such a thing as disproportionate punishment."
e8lpzq,"You’re not the asshole and He’s overreacting. If he really expects you to be honest with him, he’s going to have to stop throwing tantrums every time."
e8lqdq,"NTA


Your friend won't get expelled for being sent a picture. Especially since he likely didn't get a super high score, and left the chat immediately. He'll probably be talked to though. 


You should say something, and get the ball rolling for an investigation. Cheaters ruin everything."
e8lqhz,INFO what are you hoping to accomplish by telling her? You just want to point it out to her? Unnecessary and will make her upset. You want her to change her laugh? YTA
e8ls6x,NTA just because you buy your parents a gift with your siblings does not mean you have to suddenly buy for your partners parents.
e8lsfz,"NTA anyone who knows that a cactus has spikes should know not to get pricked, and if some accident happens doesn't immediately panic.  I doubt she was upset afterwards and you shouldn't feel bad for her either. She didn't accept any help that you were trying to give and thereby you shouldn't continue trying."
e8lt88,YWBTA - write a letter and burn it instead
e8lwpa,"NTA. Your mom has been an asshole to you your entire life so she shouldn't be shocked you wouldn't go to Christmas, and she makes no attempts to rekindle your relationship either. The facebook may be slightly petty, but it is still understandable on a human level."
e8lx0k,"YTA for proposing before ""knowing if you want to fully commit""."
e8lxac,"NTA because what else are you supposed to do if the postal service never delivers to your actual house? Maybe talk to the neighbor about what they would prefer you to do, but I don't see any alternative, nor do I see a need for an alternative as taking two minutes to just walk up and down his property every couple of days(?) Isn't harming anyone or anything"
e8m45b,"NTA, just let your thank your first friend and let them know that you found a ride that fits better with your schedule"
e8m6sx,NTA. It was an honest mistake and your boyfriend’s daughter didn’t seem offended by it. Your sister is making an assumption here. It wouldn’t hurt to put the date on your calendar to remember to wish her a happy birthday next year.
e8m8kh,"NAH I can relate with your husband wanting to believe in a place that he is comfortable with, but I also agree with you. It seems like the workplace is taking advantage of him so if anyone is the asshole its the workplace."

e8mili,NTA - Don't do it man. Never loan money to family and friends . . . UNLESS you never want to see them again.
e8misg,"YTA. Yes, it's annoying when someone is on their phone with the light glowing when you're trying to sleep, but address that separately. Once you threw clothes over his phone you were deliberately hiding it from him. That's very different from not offering to help him search for it when you don't know where it is. Whether losing his phone warranted a freak out or not, you were trying to be TA at that point."
e8mmcw,"I've actually visited her a few times since the stunt she pulled off. Everytime I visit she was still the same and I just filter out or change topic whenever she have smtg negative to say about my parents . I just realised I somehow haven't seen her in a while for no particular reason other than I'm lazy/lazy to be patient in hearing the same things over and over again. Oh, and I also know for sure she will give me a hard time for not visiting for so long when I do visit her.. + we don't really have anything to talk about anymore"
e8mmip,"Nah

If she has been sick with the shingles for 2 weeks, I will assume that she is out of the loop and has not been at work and probably doesn't have a solid hold on exactly what went down if you did not provide it to her as her friend. The first thing I would have done is call my friend oh, I guess that maybe what I'm implying here and I do think it may be true.
I don't know y'all's Dynamic but I will say that if you did not do that when you got canned, maybe she perhaps thought that you did not want to talk about it or that it wasn't as big of a deal as it appeared initially?
 When we have friends for a lifetime, a lot gets Shrugged away. It just has to because we are dealing with human beings. If we don't communicate, it really isn't fair to judge how they reacted. I think the best thing to do is to be honest and sincere and gentle and to have an adult conversation about it, if this is a friendship that you want to have continued. Maybe it isn't. Maybe this is just one piece of many that are basically resentments that have built silently. If so straighten your shoulders and walk away classily. You can still be kind when you run into her. But you don't have to necessarily make that person a big part of your life. At the end of the day, your friend has been sick and they did not have the say when it came to whether or not you kept this job. So I don't think that I really see any assholes here, because I think that I also understand why you would be stung and hurt. But I don't think that your reason reflects that you have a friendship with someone who is just a butthole."
e8mrnw,"ESH - If your friend is “seeking company elsewhere” and not willing to confront the issues she has with her partner, that sucks. Was it the best idea to maybe share information that your friend told you in private, also no; but at the end of the day they were both wasting each other’s time. Not a great situation all around!"
e8mt5u,"NTA. I'd honestly talk to your boss about her, tell them that she tends to monopolize your time. She sounds incredibly lazy"
e8mtmg,ESH. He does sound like a jerk but this is a passive aggressive way of handling the situation that doesn't actually improve your relationship with him or the roommate situation. Also aren't you and the other roommates also uncomfortable in the inferno? Maybe less than him but still 79? 85? Yuck
e8mtvy,NTA. No one wants to waste money at Christmas. Be kind though. He sounds sweet.
e8mykn,"NTA. I'm a teacher and am surprised by the judgments here. I'm all for a laid-back approach and joking around with my students but I would never under any circumstances refer to them in that manner. Our job aside from teaching the material is provide a classroom where students feel respected and safe. Even thought this was said in jest, taking a dig like that is disrespectful. Your daughter probably did't think too much about it, but for someone who is supposed to be a role model and mentor to call them 'Dummy' is not cool. I think emailing to get his side would be a justifiable thing to do."
e8mzwl,[removed]
e8n0ot,"NTA. Your gf is being totally unreasonable. A sore throat is not an excuse to call in sick. If she needs the dress tomorrow then she will have to suck it up and get it herself, facing the consequences while doing so."
e8n8d0,"YTA.

I don't know why women from a different generation seem so obsessed with erect nipples or visible nipples under the shirt, going braless, etc. but nipples, visible or not, does not harm anyone and does not command attention.

Your son's gf's body is NOT yours to dictate and no, you cannot tell someone to dress a certain way. She might not like your fashion choices either but she's not telling you to dress like her either. Lay off."
e8ndqn,Nta. You don't want to be part of the family business
e8nflg,"NAH. It's hard for teachers sometimes when the reaction of parents can be variable. Reactionary parents can make a teacher's life hell. 

Having said that,  you deserve to be respected and recognised as her partner. 

There certainly isn't the stigma attached to homosexuality,  lesbianism,  transsexuals etc that there used to be,  so you could be surprised,  especially if you live in a very liberal area.

Does she have a close colleague that she could out herself to safely to test the waters? Sooner or later,  you're both going to have to get on the same page on this if your relationship is going to survive."
e8nihc,"NTA-But your group of friends should consider breaking ties with this emotionally abusive and manipulative ""friend ""."
e8nny4,"NTA. In general I do think it's good to be respectful, and telling your mom to shut up is not good. But in this case it sounds like you just snapped after a long, loud argument that was not at all your fault. Your mom obviously has some issues. I know it's hard, but try not to take it to heart. It was really nice of you to bring her a soda."
e8nqi8,"NTA. It was on the low end for a tip, but the bartender's behavior is inexcusable. 

Also, it's not like it was a huge bill. At MOST she stood to gain, what, two more dollars in your tip? Bad word of mouth from you, or a bad review online, will hurt her a lot more than losing those two bucks."
e8nt9b,">. My boyfriend replied ""Your approach wasn't much better,""

Your boyfriend thinks he was flirting with you and somehow you owed it to this dude to feign interest? Your boyfriend, of all people? You're NTA (your boyfriend, frankly, is). You don't owe it to any dude to let him down nicely, I think men underestimate how often this sort of shit happens and how much energy goes into carefully letting someone down nicely or wasting time listening to them, ect."
e8nve9,NTA. Your girlfriend doesn't need to be with you every second of the day. You need your space sometimes. Talk to her and make her understand
e8o2ul,"NAH. 

It seems your both struggling with your own feelings and issues about the situation and how to communicate it a way that doesn’t hurt either of you. 

Difficult situation all around."
e8o5hi,"NTA Ben is not ta for cancelling (though v annoying) - and you are not ta for not refunding him. There are consequences for being a flake - and if money is committed then you have no right for it back. Reason is that everyone else may have made different decisions if the original cost was going to be higher.

Mark is very slightly ta for guilting you and enabling Ben."

e8pf6b,NTA let it go and let him go. It's emotional abuse and he sounds toxic
e8pfre,NTA. But you may as well break up. If he’s adamant about being with a vegan and you are not a vegan I don’t see how this relationship will work. Cut your losses and move on.
e8phfc,YTA for not reporting them to the police already
e8pi7u,"ESH. It's part of having roommates, people will have different ideas of what's the 'right way' to do something.

They're silly for making it such a big issue, but you're silly for not just spending 2 seconds wiping it down to avoid this disagreement once they made it obvious that it was an issue for them."

Unless he was kidnapped in his youth and kept in a basement and had hip-hop blasted at him or some other hip-hop triggered PTSD event, that reaction was totally uncalled for."
e8psdt,[deleted]
e8pvj2,"YTA. You don’t need a bandaid fix, you need to address your insecurity/workaholism/whatever your issues are. You should work to live, not live to work. Your employer couldn’t care less about you, you are thoroughly expendable to them, so why jeopardise your life and personal relationships for them. 17 days or 10 days is not a huge amount of time to take off work. Annual leave is there to be used. 4 months is more than enough notice to give to take 2 frigging weeks off. It’s insane that you would consider cancelling and losing hundreds of $ simply because you’re worried about taking the annual leave you’re entitled to. What’s changed between now and when you agreed on the trip and booked it? The only situation in which this would be at all rational is if somehow you genuinely thought you would lose your job if you went on this trip, and even then you’d be better advised to rather find a new employer, rather than work for one that treats you like crap. 

The reason I say you need to sort yourself and your priorities out now is that this flaky b.s. is unfair to your girlfriend. Is she supposed to stay with someone who refuses to have a reasonable work/life balance and take leave to go on vacation, someone makes plans and then abruptly cancels on them at significant expense? You’re showing what you value by your actions and that you don’t value her.

EDIT: also, you booked the Maldives trip 3 months ago and still haven’t requested leave for it or told your work about it. That’s 100% on you. Sounds like you’d always wanted to back out of it. Which is flaky and stupid. If you didn’t want to go you should have just told her so and not agreed to book."
e8pwcy,">**I don't really care to be quiet** because its the kitchen and in my opinion, if your sleeping right next to the kitchen, then you should be expecting to hear kitchen noises. Am I the asshole for having a **good daily schedule**?

YTA for this.

Humans have different activity schedules, that's normal and expected. Everybody should be able to make the most of their productive time, and if yours is during the morning hours, that's fair. However, that you call yours a ""good daily schedule"" sounds like you're looking down on others for not waking up as early as you.

Also, you should at least make an effort to be quiet when you know that being loud will disrupt other's sleep. Of course certain sounds are unavoidable, but right now it sounds like you're not trying to limit your noise levels at all.

You would not be the asshole if you continue to use the kitchen but try to be more silent and speak to your cousins to evaluate whether you're waking them up."
e8pwg7,"NTA. Why would you want to spend any day around people who deliberately make you feel bad, let alone your birthday."
e8pzid,"Haha, holy shit, NTA. What an idiot.

He loves his dog in a different way than he loves you. There's a lot of different kinds of love out there. Loving a dog is simpler and much less difficult than loving a romantic partner. The emotions involved are more clear, less complex, and more consistent. There's no emotional risk in loving a dog, a dog and owner are never going to have arguments or disagreements, and your dog won't ever hurt you. Stands to reason he could love his dog 'more.'

But what kind of douchebag would say that to your face? In front of other people? Does he just straight-up not care that he hurt and embarrassed you for literally no reason? He compared you to a dog... and you lost. Wtf."
e8pzqy,NTA - Reasonable request honestly though your SO sounds lazy and it might be worth thinking about that he doesn't value your job either as he expects you to do all the house work while working. I don't get why people think working from home is different to working in an office you can't take 20 minutes off your office job to go home and wash your floors

e8qdlt,"ESH. It isn't fair for her to unload her burdens on you all of the time. We all have complaints about something. A partner is a good person to talk to if you want someone to listen, but ALL the time is just too much. 

I'm having a hard time believing you couldn't think of a more gentle way to say what you said.

>I snapped ... In the nicest way -that I know how- I looked her dead in the eyes and I told her I don't want to hear her complaining about her job if she's not doing anything to change it

No one snaps in the nicest way they know how. I can't think of an instance where you snap at someone you love and NOT owe them an apology afterwards.

But instead of telling her, tell him to change his plan completely and let her pick her own dog.

He can surprise her with new dog gear and a trip to a shelter, where she can choose her own pet.   It’s still a surprise, but a much better one.  He doesn’t want to get a dog (mill or shelter) that was totally affectionate because it adores him ... get home and discover it couldn’t care less about her.   She’s got to be there, so she can find the dog that reacts well to her.

If he still doesn’t seem to understand, *then* tell the aunt."

e8rp46,"NTA

>That I should accept that his family gets visitation too whether I agree with them or not.

You're punishing more people than your parents and this whole stonewalling  ""I won't do it because someone told me to"" is childish as all hell.

Grow up, and shower if someone tells you that you need a shower. It's called being an adult.

Insecure about BO and you think refusing to shower is going to make you less insecure? That's absolutely insane.

My brother did this crap too and it's nothing but disgusting and as you get older the only person is punishes is YOU, because more and more people think  less and less of you because you don't even care enough to wash yourself."
e8s8i5,"Slight NTA 

Look, I’m under the impression she’s the one for you otherwise you wouldn’t buy a house and let her not pay any bills. 

Listen fella, and maybe this might not be popular but you’re looking at it from a guy’s perspective, have you considered that maybe she is doing all this for you? Decorating the house so that when you come back you have a nice place to look at? 

Don’t take the road to send her back to her mum’s house, you’re bitching out of a potential for you to grow as an individual and help your SO. If after support that you provide she doesn’t fix her ways, then you need to cut your losses and take the high road. 

You mention she cooks and cleans more than you, usually, when a guy says that, it means 99/1 she’s doing the cleaning and the other 1% of time you’re doing the cooking cleaning. What are the items she’s buying? Cleaning utensils? Make up? Clothes? Are they things that you use in the house? 

Are you offering her financial support? Maybe she feels that she’s already burdened you with paying rent, so she doesn’t want to hassle you further 

This is a life partner, if she is, you need to address it, talk 

You’re NTA for how you feel and the situation around it but part of being an adult my guy is that you’re able to communicate in a calm and composed manner before this tipping point and for letting it get to that point, you’re TA, but the NTA aspect overweighs that."
e8s8qn,"YTA both of them spent alot of time together doing something special and you ruined it. You don’t have be comfortable with have a ton yet but  with all that work you should have let her keep it for the day because there was literally no harm in it, she is at an age where she will be wanting to wear it more and more. Saying no all the time because you don’t understand it is just a shit reason btw your the parent so learn or find a way for her to learn you think is appropriate, as in it doesn’t have cursing etc. She doesn’t need a ton yet but light make up should be given because; she’s interested in it, if encouraged and reinforced to do it for herself not others, there is no harm in it and she’s growing up. You need to get over that."
e8s9eu,"NAH... This is way above Reddit. You are placed in a very difficult situation and you made a choice for the betterment of your family. Honestly, chances are there are some pros and cons to both decisions. No one can call you an asshole for being stuck between a rock and a hard place."

As HR, I can't address Phil without evidence that justifies my choice. Moving Cass was the easiest method to minimize conflict that's why that was done.

Please talk to HR without the evidence, and tell HR that there are multiple instances of harrassment with evidence but the victims don't want to announce. When a similar instance occurred, we interviewed everyone universally regardless of whether they were harrassed directly or were a witness. You are a witness."
e8sf6o,"NTA. Since you didn't raise your voice or make a face it sounds like you didn't do anything wrong. From personal experience working in an office, I think a more appropriate response would be ""I cannot look right now but I'll find you when I'm done here."" Then you're free to go look when you want to (even if it is just to avoid conflict with the friend)."
e8siec,"NAH You two need an open dialogue. I don’t think she’s the asshole for being afraid of insects, you’re not the asshole for not wanting to kill them.

These two things just don't mesh.  You both need to decide which one is more important to you, but it doesn't seem like you could both have ""your way"" and keep the relationship.

Regarding splitting costs for food in a group, my friends and I have a system; in the restaurant, we order our own food, and only one person makes the payment for everyone at the cashier. Once we leave the restaurant, the paying person passes the receipt to the rest of the group, since receipts usually have the cost breakdown of all the food. Everyone looks for the cost of their own items, then hands the money to the paying person.

* nut-free: why?!  you didn't mention that anyone had allergies, so you're just stiffing the variety out of personal preference it seems?  am i missing something?
* gluten-free: you really shouldn't be pushing this on other people.  it's your choice, let people make their favorite cookies.  the fact that you say ""gluten free is optional"" still puts pressure on people to be gluten free. if it's optional just dont' say it"

Yes, it probably would have been better to word things differently, but it's mentally exhausting to deal with these situations. A bad relationship doesn't just affect the people in a bad relationship, it affects everyone around them who care about them.

That being said, the more you tell someone clinging to a bad relationship that they need to get out, the more they'll distance themselves from you. I was once in a bad relationship and there were people who I knew did not like the fact that I was in that relationship, and you know what? I didn't talk to them about it because I knew how they felt about the other person. I'd usually find other things to talk about with them. But if they too aggressively started questioning me about my relationship, I distanced myself from them, kind of cut them out. I know, I was the asshole for doing that, but I tried to always leave a path for that not to happen. In the end, I had to realize that they were right on my own terms. Maybe that's not a good thing, but it was what it was.

You're probably not going to convince her to break up, but she's got to realize that the person who she's talking to doesn't like the person she's with. Either she can handle that or she can't, but she can't expect you to feel the same way about everything if she's the one calling you up to pour everything out on you like that. If she knows your position, she doesn't have to agree with you, but she does have to respect the fact that you've already stated your position and it is different from hers. You don't want bees, don't poke the nest."

I’m not vegetarian but my ex husband suffered from gout so I modified our meal plan so that we had a lot of meat free meals each week. It’s not hard at all to make tasty vegetarian dishes or at least make better side dishes than just bread and salad.

If he’s paying the majority of the grocery bill and working full time and so you’re cooking because that’s your division of labor, then just try?

There are a lot of very tasty dishes you can make. Lots of stir fry (breath of the wok is a great recipe book!) lots of Buddhist recipes, many sides that include beans or other legumes. 

If you guys want to cook separately and that works for you, fine. But it does seem kind of assholey to not even try to accommodate half the time.  He can cook for himself, get some boca burgers or something for protein. But wow.

Kind of makes me feel like a closet veggie because I only eat meat I can source and confirm and am happy eating veggie...but I Iove meat!"

You know what the “generational thing” is?

30-40 years ago, people stayed with companies for the long haul and were rewarded for doing so. They had pensions and benefits and bonuses. 

Nowadays people are lucky to have a living wage. You can’t miss time for sickness, actually taking vacation days you’ve accrued is considered “lazy,” and you’re expected to be reachable 24/7. 

FUCK THEM. They will replace you in a heartbeat, so who the fuck you being loyal for?

I just killed myself for the last year in a hospital i worked as a RN. I worked weeks where i was there for 7 12 hour shifts in a row because they were short. HOWEVER, i moved from per diem (worked whenever i wanted) to full time in July. In September, i was injured on the job. Comp denied me, and i was told that because i didn’t qualify for FMLA (i had the time, but was 300 hours short of the requirement in a rolling calendar year) they were firing me. I tried to get a spot back on light duty status and was told no. I had to come back without restrictions. I tried to go from full time to per diem again to keep my spot. I was told no. 

Everything i did for them, and they spit in my face. To make matters worse? No unemployment until i sit under a hearing. They’ve fought me on it, saying they weren’t aware that i could work with restrictions and so my leaving was voluntary. 

These are the types of companies we work for these days.

Pick a date, invite a couple friends (ideally at least one he knows and likes) and invite people for a few drinks or something.  I'll also add that part of him blowing you off could be the new lady in his life and you being recently divorced...optics over reality is common for such matters to many partners"
e976lk,"YTA:   Eric obviously does not ""work well with others"".

And you have failed to train, supervise, discipline, and/or terminate Eric as needed.   Consequently, he was insubordinate and assumed your role by trying to train, supervise, and discipline another employee.

Eventually, you find out he's driven out another valuable employee AFTER THE FACT and without any idea why.   ( Eric intentionally cut you out of the loop is why. )   THIS IS A LEGAL RISK.   If you get sued by her, your ""I had no idea what was going on"" is a losing strategy in court.

You're not managing him properly, so he's playing you.   And I'm sure he has an explanation that you'll give him the benefit of the doubt, because you don't see that he's acting in bad-faith.

Him being insufficiently polite and deferential to YOUR WIFE is a whole other problem.   That's a personal insult to YOU, bro.

Here's what you do.   Hire another pharmacist immediately.   Don't waste time other than, ""they're properly licensed and not drunk at the interview"".  Then upgrade and fire Eric."

You're an adult and you get to choose how you want to spend your time. And while growing up there will be a time that things shift from visiting your own parents to celebrate the holidays at your own place.

When I was early twenties I would always stay at my parents' place. Then my bf and I would spend the first day of christmas at his parents' place and the second at my parents' (switching every year). When we had kids, we invited our parents at our place (those were great times). Now, our parents are too old to travel and we've gone back to visiting them during christmas.

But you did what you could, what your boss said was essentially a no, you can't leave. Unfortunately your job doesn't have to care about your wife or your pets, though that does say a lot about the company.

If money is tight you need to do everything you can to keep your job to keep going in the future. Unfortunately we may lose our pets at unexpected times, this was a time you didn't have a lot of choice over.

Instead of being upset at each other you should both support each other. That's why you are together."
e97h9s,"NTA but I would keep giving the gifts. Knowing your biological father at least had you in his thoughts periodically is better than he didn’t care enough to ever concern himself to keep any connection.

e97l8h,"NAH. She shouldn't get upset with you if you do go. She can be frustrated, sure, but she shouldn't take it out on you. Don't waste the tickets. Definitely let her know ahead of time so she isn't surprised, but I would say to post on your social if anyone else is free to join you. Alternatively, if there's a way you could take the day off yourself and help your GF with her job so she can finish early and you can both go, that would make you the hero and make her happy, but that is a big ask and may not be possible for you.

I actually had a similar situation for a play my wife really wanted to see. It was a Broadway production of Cinderella. Very well done. It was in the city where I work and at 8 months pregnant with our first, she was going to take the train in after work. But unfortunately there was an issue with the train line and they were cancelled. And since it was rush hour and she was already tired, she just went home. Since the train wasn't working and I was already downtown with the tickets, I grabbed the last colleague in the office and went to the show with him. Fantastic show, and she was upset, but not with me, there was nothing I could do and wasting the tickets would have been silly"
e97lj1,YTA - it’s one thing to use a professional you don’t know. It’s a massively different thing to use a professional who is a friend. Boudoir shoots are extremely intimate and revealing. By having him do the shoot you allowed your male friend to see that intimacy. I can understand why your husband would be weirded out or upset.

so much asshole. she's making the shared space more uncomfortable.

the next compromise i would suggest is that you unplug it whenever you want to be in the living room.  it can be plugged in in the general case, but unplugged when it would make you uncomfortable.  that's much less time unplugged, and puts the burden on yourself, rather than her.  this isn't a fair setup, but it keeps the peace better than an ultimatum or legal avenues."

e9b6mz,"YTA: Your mom wants to spend time with you because she loves you and probably misses the fact that you were once a small child and are maybe approaching an age where you're going to move out of her home forever.  Trust me, as someone who once had a mom that ""smothers"" I can tell you that you will appreciate the fact that she is trying to build a relationship with you now once you're older. One one day you won't be down the hall from your mom anymore and she won't just be able to pop into your room to see what you're up to. Try to be kind and grateful that you have someone who loves you."
e9b7nx,"Ehh.  Kinda YTA.

You left the house in the middle of the night, to pick up an ex because she called you crying.  Stopped at the store for her, drove her home, and decided to text your gf about it the next day.

The GF you left sleeping at home through all of this.  And nonchalantly mentioned it to the next day.

Of course she's going to feel some kinda way about you just sneaking out to pick up an ex off the curb.

>She said she doesn't think I cheated, but that I 'couldnt resist a pretty girl calling me for help', like what? Its extremely weird she would say that considering I know she talks about how she doesn't find fat people attractive, and Erica is easily 250+ lbs

It's not a matter of if your GF thinks Erica is pretty.  She's saying that *you* can't resist a girl *you* think is pretty calling you for help.  I'd imagine she's pretty secure in thinking you find Erica attractive, since you did date her."

It's their vacation too and it's kind of unfair to force them to spend it in an uncomfortable arrangement just so you guys can pay a little less. 

You're being petty by focusing on how the singles ""get a whole room to themselves,"" when we all know that the couples want to room together anyway so it's not any skin off your back.

Kid has no idea what time is worth yet. I had a neighbor kid dropping, limbing, chopping, and cording for pennies. I agreed to his price, but paid him almost double when it was done and told him to know his worth. Next time I needed him, he priced accordingly and thanked me."
e9d2y1,"NAH

I would leave it to my SO to decide if they wanted their mother invited or not. If they don't care... not happening. 

I also have very little patience for someone who endangers the life of my kid... I'm weird like that. So the one caveat is I would want to make sure she is never in a position to do that again... but it doesn't sound like she is."
e9d4av,NTA. Your girlfriend is nuts.

e9dc50,"Thank you for the full story.

NTA

Please if possible stop your father from getting another animal for the wellbeing of that dog. Perhaps writing out a budget on the costs of the dog and how many lottery tickets he could buy will help him visualize the financial side."
e9dd39,"NTA - Your mom is an adult and can do what she pleases. Bad relationships are like heroin addictions in that you can't make a person stop if the don't want to.

But you and your sister are also adults. You don't have to be exposed to situations you don't want to be exposed to."
e9dg3e,"I am 100% on the ""pets are for life"" boat as well, but in this situation I think that if you do your due diligence and find this dog an appropriate home you WNBTA. I feel like no matter how much you love this dog, his quality of life will suffer as he'll inevitably wind up separated from you and then family more and more due to fears of his behavior while you're pregnant or around the baby. There are absolutely good and bad situations for every dog, and not all dogs are compatible with children. As you could not have reasonably anticipated that you would be having children, this isn't a lack foresight on your part, it's just a sad circumstance where you need to make a tough decision in the best interests of your family AND your dog.

I wish you the best of luck finding him an amazing home!"
e9diem,"YWBTA here. 

Finances are a top contributor to divorce cases. This is something you __must__ tackle head-on either between you two or potentially with a therapist. 

Splitting finances may be a real come-to-Jesus moment, and it may be effective, but it’s worth a serious discussion first. Going behind your spouse’s back will cause more worse problems."
e9djno,"NAH.

Honestly I think your parents should have never gotten the cat in the first place. Yours or not they were the adults and should have known they would have to accept some responsibility(such as vet expenses). And then to throw them outside unfixed? That was seriously irresponsible."
e9dv6i,NTA.  It's really annoying when people complain over and over about something that they have control over.  But how about having some fruit salad on the side that could be eaten with or without the cheesecake?  Some of your other guests might appreciate a healthy alternative for dessert and then she won't have a reason to blame you if her stomach hurts later.
e9dvjj,"Esh, but only because of how you responded. ""I'll pass"" is not how you turn down an invitation to be in a wedding. ""Thank you for thinking of me, sadly I just can't afford it right now,"" is the polite response."

e9e5wn,"NTA, that's stupid. It's a gift card, that's what it's there for."
e9e6hq,"NTA/NAH

I'm hard pressed to call your ex TA. She had trauma with her dad and it might have an impact on her relationships for the rest of her life. It wasn't fair of her to impose those insecurities on you but I am sympathetic to her feelings. 

Your drinking sounds reasonable. When you're a college kid, it's sort of expected that you go a little crazy and to not be 100% responsible with your alcohol intake. That being said, when it comes to having a relationship with a victim of abuse, you probably should have been a little more sensitive to her concerns. They weren't coming from a place of concern for your wellbeing as much as they were coming from a place of fear for her own safety."
e9e6z0,"NTA. You’re making your work space into just that, your space. If others come in, they have to accept the decor that comes with it."
e9eahl,"NAH Yes you aren't suppose to expect gifts but relationships are a two way street so there should be some give and take and it seems this issue is highlighting the lack of give and take for you. 

You should either decide you don't care and keep doing what you do or just stop giving a nice of gifts and then you won't feel slighted."
e9edkf,"NTA for everything except the dietary stuff.  It doesn't sound like they're great pet owners, but messing with an animal's diet out of nowhere is just asking for diarrhea.  Vets recommend a mixture of wet and dry food because the wet gives the cat a little extra hydration, but it's far from mandatory.  My cats eat exclusively dry food (for dental reasons) and they're fine.  Don't mess with the food.  But I'd say no, you don't have to hit the cat.  Just keep your bathroom door shut and it becomes a non issue - if they ask, you won't even have to lie."
e9ektj,"tough one to judge.  but i can't justify your lies and going against court here.  you should fight this through legal means, not with theft and lies.

YTA.  give the cat back, and pursue future checks on her treatment of the pets to see if she's changed.

\---

Also, i'm curious, if this was the woman's daughter, and she had convinced CPS to give the daughter back, would you advocate theft and lies there, or is this different?"
e9eo2q,YTA... you had a bad day and upset her ok. So she doesn’t come to you for help. You reach out when she’s having a hard time and she doesn’t want your help so instead of backing off you make her feel worse by piling on? Asshole.
e9eo50,"YTA.  It's a restaurant, not a library.  If you've ordered everything you plan to order and are dawdling over your coffee so you have an excuse to hang around, the least you can do is let the waitstaff make the table as ready to go as they can for when you finally do decide to leave.  And even if you disagree with that take on the situation, I'm genuinely not sure how you feel it would have been *less* rude of her to just reach across you than to tell you what she was trying to do."
e9erm0,"YTA, not for wanting the vasectomy but for 1. how you approached it with your wife and 2. how little research you seem to have done on the topic. 

My husband had a vasectomy during his first marriage and recently had it reversed. The reversal surgery can be really expensive, painful, and there still isnt a guaranteed success rate. But it seemed like our best option. IVF can be invasive to women and really mess with hormones. And again, very expensive. As much as I want a baby with my husband, I'm hesitant about IVF. 

Also a heads up - if you ever go down the road of divorce, you could still end up in a nasty battle over frozen sperm and embryos, just as you would custody of children. 

I respect your decision to be the one to step up in terms of pregnancy prevention, but a vasectomy isn't a decision to made alone or without extensive research."
e9erq6,Grabbing other people’s private areas is generally rude in public. If you’re in a bar or club that’s different. But no one else wants to see your foreplay. YTA mildly

Omg she's not ""just a friend"" after he slept with her the day after breaking up with you. 

If his reaction was different I would say nah, but making you feel crazy is gaslighting. It's not ""I know it must hurt but she's a good friend of mine, could we find a way to make it work?"", no, it's straight up ""you are being unreasonable"".

Do you really want to be with this guy?"
e9fw8i,"NTA. Talk to your dad about this asap; he may want to pursue full custody of you if he knows the extent of things, and you may need to call DFCS  if there is no food in the house for you and your siblings."

You had the oppertunity to just thank them and leave it lay. Instead you decided to whine about your gift. When he asked for it back you refused. What the fuck do you want exactly? People need to learn to be more gracious about receiving gifts."
e9g3pp,"NTA. You’re 18, an adult, and like you said you weren’t asking permission. It’s not on your mum to set terms and conditions for how you hang out with your friends.

And did a misread that, or does your mum expect you to pay for 2 extra tickets for her and your sister?? Wtf? Your mum is TA for trying to guilt trip you.

Best advice, ignore your mum and set a day aside for you and your sister to spend together. Go to lunch, or shopping, the movies, or do something festive like build a gingerbread house or see if there are activities in your community. I’m sure that will be much more comfortable for both of you, and she will appreciate spending one-on-one time with you. Hell, she might even take it as a chance to open up to you herself about what’s going on in her life."
e9g48u,"NTA, though keep the Altima for yourself and give away the car you've been using."
e9g4yv,"NTA.  No way would I offer a full refund.  Best refund would subtract gas money, depreciation and time wasted.  If you drove 100 miles, that's $50 in gas & depreciation right there, assuming your time is worthless.

e9g6al,Nta. Take over the kitchen and become king.
e9g6ha,"NAH, but I don't think you should blame the kids because of the issues the adults have. They let the slime dry out, but they are kids and not being raised by responsible parents. But my guess is that they probably love spending time with you. Why not take the kids (alone) out for some Christmas celebration? Maybe just for a movie or Ice Cream. Let them know that you care. Your time will probably be the best Christmas present you can give."

It's ok to build your own life. Your mother will adjust.

Good luck!"
e9gjgb,NTA. Who dates their niece’s ex and expects her to be okay with it?
e9gp9j,"NAH.

I totally get why she did what she did if the family is comfortable. I honestly regret putting my ex FWB on our son's birth certificate because he automatically gets child support garnished and he makes my life difficult out of spite. I can see why she decided not to go down that path. I'd not have done it if I had my time over. The small amount of support I get (he hides income/assets) isn't worth having to be in contact wth him and try to get his permission for things. 

You don't want to be a father, and she is clearly happy with you not being one, prefers it even, and the child is well taken care of, so I think you are well within your rights to leave it be. You got lucky not getting saddled with 18 years of child support, so be more careful with protection next time, most men don't get that lucky."
e9gscq,"NTA, that’s definitely way too close of a relationship. The alarm bells are ringing everywhere. I’d give an ultimatum I think. Either distance himself from her or you guys break up"

e9h1u0,"You aren't being bitter or petty. As a nurse who has had the pleasure(?) of taking care of a lot of folks during their last days, death makes people weird. Please expect and prepare for this behavior by your family members to get worse as this process reaches it's eventual end because it most certainly will. Take care of yourself, because the people surrounding your father will not. This is their last chance to rugsweep his behavior, they are going to try their hardest to make this ""okay."" 

NTA"
e9h36m,"NAH. You can’t change what your work needs you to do, especially considering it’s a new position for you. I understand why your wife is upset, her feelings are valid because it’s really upsetting to go back to work after being on maternity leave like that. I think you’ve done all you can do, and I also think she will warm up to the trip you have to take. It’s still several weeks away, give her some time and realize that a lot of things are at play here. Lots of hormones freaking out postpartum, lack of sleep, etc."
e9h4ym,"NTA. I like your plan a lot. If all the kids are ok with it, then let them stay together. The 5yo is too young to care about getting her own room. She will care in a few years when she hits her teen years, but that's a conversation for when SHE starts to feel the need for own space.

From the 5yo's perspective, I can see why she wants to stay in the room with her sisters. She probably already occasionally feels left out of the relationship because her only two sisters are twins, as opposed to all the three of them being triplets. Staying in a room with them is way more fun as a 5yo, and is a way for her to stay connected to them and feel less like an outsider in the sibling relationship.

Moving her upstairs to the attic might hurt at this age more than it would help because EVERYONE else is on the ground floor. She is too young to understand 'the need' for her own room. From her perspective, moving her out now will feel like getting kicked prematurely out of a slumber party everyone else (including the parents) is in on and make her feel isolated (even if though this is not the intention)

Edited for grammar"
e9h9sc,NTA but you guys seem to really need to sit down and have a talk. This blow up and post makes it super clear that you feel like you’re doing more than your fair share of the work — and from what you’ve written you are. I’d say you should try to have a candid conversation with him about the division of chores and the toll it is taking on you. Give him the chance to step up and help.

Spare this poor woman from the pain."
e9hmg1,"YTA. I get not liking to play with your brother but he doesn't have anyone else. You're lucky you enjoy having online friends, but he doesn't have that luxury. He's acting out against you and calling you a jerk because he's an 11 year old kid who probably looks up to you and doesn't know how to express his feelings properly yet.

Just not wrong enough to be TA if that makes sense."
e9ilq1,"YTA, but very gently. I absolutely get where you're coming from, but at the same time it would cost you little to do this for her. Someday her poor planning and relying on others will catch up to her, but today you can choose to be kind...for your sake, not hers."

Guarding “your lane” and trying to stop people from merging does nothing but add to the traffic problem. At best you stay one car further ahead in the line of traffic and at worst you cause a collision.

As an artist she's probably trying to go with a very specific look for her sculpture and needs a very specific reference to look at. 

YOU called off a date with someone who looked heavier in person than in her photos. Which, mind you, photos can make a person look thinner than you are irl. Lighting, patterns, time of the day/month could make her look bigger or smaller in photos hell even the damn angle could have. 

It's not a double standard. You straight up called off a date with someone who could have been very excited to meet you and talk because she was heavier than you thought. 

SHE passed on a model that didn't match what she needed for a sculpture. Those aren't even on the same coin. She's not getting her sculptures hopes up only to crush them in it's face. 

Ya feel me."

e9lsqc,"You're not really a true AH (just more naïve by the sounds of it) but for this sub and this situation, yeah YTA.

**Her parents asked you to respect their boundaries and you proceeded to actively disrespect them.** Which definitely makes you look not that good in your girlfriend's parents' eyes. For many reasons. You probably (read: very likely) also made the maid feel uncomfortable. Also honestly, wtf, why would you not respect your girlfriend's parents? 

It's her job, let her do it. She likely has a system for how she does things and you more than likely disrupted that.

Just because you think you're helping, doesn't mean you actually are.

You wouldn't get up in a plane and start helping the air hosts? Or hotel maids? Or anyone in the service industry?

This is how I felt when working in the restaurant industry; Lots of customers would try to ""help"" in different ways, such as taking drinks off my tray and passing them around. However I would balance the tray in a certain way, adjusting it to how I took items off. Suddenly taking the drinks off would cause an imbalance, and most likely result in spilling the rest of the drinks over someone, or at the very least me having to suddenly get rid of what was in my other hand to prevent the tray from tipping. Then I have a new mess to clean up.

You are causing an imbalance at her work. AH move, even with your ""good"" intentions 

Another scenario; if her parents invite you over to a catered dinner, would you try ""help"" the caterers? (I hope your response is ""of course not"")

Also why did you girlfriend have to leave with you?

But it would help you if you tried to get used to it, as well as help your relationship with her parents (which obviously would help your relationship with your girlfriend).

ETA Also this is all coming from someone who gets it. My family is very frugal, and everyone needs to pull their weight. However, my parents started earning much more and being home less in my early teenage years. Household help was the best solution, that way they didn't have to stress about basic cleaning etc. When they were home they could focus on just enjoying family time, instead of stressing about chores. Reduced stress for not only my parents, but their children as well. Having household help allowed us to spend valuable time with each other. They were always really friendly with the people they employed, even going as far as to help with their medical costs, social security etc. It took me a while to get used to it, but honestly it just comes down to accepting that all people have different jobs, and respecting that.

Edit #2: clarifications

Edit #3: your actions more than likely sent the message to your girlfriend's parents that you don't agree with them having household help. Even further disrespecting them.
Get used to the fact that all people have different jobs. Respect your girlfriend's family, and their employees. (If I wasn't clear, yeah I'd be insulted, or at the very least feel humiliated, if I was the maid you tried to help. Please learn some social etiquette as well). Yeah that wasn't your intention, but it's all about how things are received.

Some of the best advice Ivve ever received: focus on your message and the recipient, not the phrase you want to deliver (obviously not directly translatable to English, but I tried)"

However I really hope you consider counseling- it is entirely possible for you to have a marriage completely unlike your parents’. 

Both my husband and I grew up in broken homes, him worse so than I, however both ended up in divorce, lots of conflict and fights, the whole 9 yards.

We had the attitude of “I refuse to ever be like them”. When times got rough for us we both sought counseling- independently and together- and worked on it. 

We have a beautiful marriage and I can’t imagine my life without him. I am expecting our first child and it’s a magical time for us... and we are absolutely nothing like our parents.

There is no reason they need it. if their hearts are truly wanting to give your child money for college without strings or legal implications then they can put it in the account you set up. 

Like you pointed out in your post, them having a separate account can screw up your child's financial options if they don't like what your child is majoring in, what school they want to go to or simply decide they're mad at your child. It gives them too much power for people who like control."

The exception is if the boss is leaving: chipping in for a token gift then is acceptable - but not expected.

One of the hardest things to deal with as a young adult is understanding that people are growing and changing at different rates. You will likely grow apart from people as you get older, particularly high school friends. I know that it's probably even harder as an autistic person to make new friends, but you should consider finding new ones. Changes in life and changes in friends happen. Particularly at your age. This is an opportunity to learn and grow, and it sucks because it hurts like a mofo. But those people are not being the friends you need for where you are in your life.

e9rza1,"NTA, you are behaving like a responsible parent. Going no-contact is fine when dealing with friends and nagging parents, but dude is a father. It's not, in any way, acceptable. Missing his custody day with only ""might not be able to make it"" communicated before-hand is not acceptable. Whining about being removed as the emergency contact when he deliberately tries to be difficult to reach is *not acceptable*.

Reaching out to his parents was the absolutely correct course of action to take."
e9s0v1,"You would NOT be the asshole for submitting a DNA kit to prove it to yourself because you’re free to do whatever you want as far as that goes, but you would be the asshole if you pursue it further after the family has said they’re not interested.

e9s1f4,"NAH. It was your wife’s idea. However, having a new baby in the home can be a shock so I would say be prepared for the possibility that the baby comes and circumstances change that prevent you from going. That’s all. It’s easy to plan for it but you don’t know what will happen."

The ""i'm not your therapist"" is something you say to someone who is ALWAYS using you as a therapist, not someone on a first date who is trying to just sort of share where he's at.

e9sspn,"I don’t fundamentally disagree with your wife (or you).  So I’m going with NAH with a couple of caveats.

1) you guys need to be proactive and go speak with the teacher for heaven’s sake!

2) encouraging the kids to tell the teacher “we were just too busy” is not a great move. These kids are going to have to learn how to get the busy work done at some point because you may get away with blowing off a 1st grade teacher but if they haven’t clued in on this soon, grades WILL drop. And not because your kid isn’t bright but because he isn’t going the required work.

I think a lot of home work is dumb. At that age, I think kids should only have “homework” if they need more time to compete something they were given time to do in class.  I have seen some project rubrics that just made me want to pull my hair out when the kids were little. 

But you can’t just encourage a kid to disregard their teacher. 

And some of the activities may be things they share in class or exchange papers to check and now your kid hasn’t done it. Might not be awesome for your kid."

Feel free to tell all your mutual friends about how he was a huge jerk.

He needs to be open to finishing by himself, or you could give him a hand job, maybe even get a pocket pussy to use once you've tapped out. It sounds like your boyfriend wants you to make him cum without helping out at all. Every partner I've been with that regularly lasted that long was super gracious when I tapped out, or made an effort to get close before intercourse so the work wasn't all up to me.

I don't think you're an asshole for not donating anything (that's definitely an acceptable response). But you are TA for dismissing your niece's experiences just because they don't line up with your beliefs. If God is real, then he gave me bad eyesight, so am I disrespecting him by correcting it with laser eye surgery? No, that's clearly a societally acceptable response. If God made your niece a boy, and she's correcting that by transitioning, why is that any worse than my surgery?
I'm not saying you have to change your whole belief system, but definitely consider that train of thought and be supportive of your niece - this is going to be an awful time for her, and she'll be getting a ridiculous amount of judgement and hate for this decision. You can either be a negative force in her life, or be supportive."

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***

I started working at this company a little less than a year ago. Since day one my manager has just not liked me. Not really sure why, but she is constantly just looking for things to hangover me. Luckily for me I do my work to a high standard so she rarely has anything to try hang me with. She also treats most people on our team the same way and we’re all aware of her inability to be fair and professional with people reporting directly to her so try adjust our behavior accordingly.

However, there is one girl on our team (let’s call her Lucy) who our manager likes. I have always gotten on well with this girl and would have called her a friend. She would always sympathize with me with regards the unfair treatment I and the rest of the team receive. A few days ago my manager assigned me a task to do. During lunch I mentioned to Lucy that I was assigned this task but I wasn’t sure if I’d get to it that day. Lucy says she has time and offers to take it on for the afternoon. I’m delighted but know I’ll have to clear it with my manager first.

When we return from lunch Lucy asks if I’ve told our manager about her completing the task. I told her I have not yet but I would. When our manager gets back to her desk she’s on the phone and is then busy in meetings. When she is free Lucy tells her that I have gotten her to do the task instead and she needs guidance. Safe to say my manager was not happy that I had delegated this task and read me the rioting act. When she left I turned to Lucy and probably in an annoyed and frustrated tone said “why did you throw me under the bus like that? You knew I hadn’t cleared it with her to give you the task to complete? And you know how she overreacts and looks for shit to give out to me for”. Now all of this I could have gotten over, my manager is a certified asshole so can’t blame Lucy for the reaction and we all make mistakes and say things we shouldn’t to the wrong people. However, after I expressed my frustrations with how she handled the situation she got super defensive and said she thought I had asked (even though there is no way she could have thought that) and now is completely ignoring me.

So Reddit AITA for expressing my annoyance at my coworker for throwing me under the bus to my unhinged manager?

e9wdct,"NTA, tell him your sister needs to pick up her slack"
e9we1w,ESH big time. You blocked his texts? How does that solve anything. You could have told him that you didn’t want it in the living room in a better way.

e9wzwm,"NTA This is a textbook case of gaslighting and manipulative emotional dependency. 

Gaslighting- you, in your own story, are questioning your very intent when you didn’t tell her about this moment. She immediately frames your intent as sinister and thus, when you don’t remember it that way, are feeling you are losing your bearings on reality. 

Emotional dependency- by constantly texting you, you are unable to communicate with anyone else and are allowing yourself to be cut off from social contact from anyone else. 

This is abuse. Get out of this relationship now."

And also, I believe you have an opportunity here. If she’s normally quite chill and you enjoy living all four of you together, give her a pass. 

ONE PASS does not give people free reign to be assholes. But it might open the floor to a dialogue that she would be grateful to have. Not because she’s a woman or anything, it’s just that I’ve been that person before. I’ve been an ass when I shouldn’t have been and it had nothing to do with that person. You don’t owe her anything, but you could level up as a human by taking a step back and giving her the opportunity to apologize and explain herself. 

God I love when people give me one pass. It allows me to make shit right with people I care about. I hope you get passes occasionally too :)

e9y726,YTA. If she wants to have this baby then she should have this baby. Pro-choice means she gets to chose. You don’t get to tell her she’s somehow less of a woman for making a choice she wants to make when feminism is literally about women making the choices they want to make. You owe your friend an apology.
e9yc9a,NTA. Sounds like they’re being jerks on a power trip.
e9yca9,"As someone who often plans company lunches/dinners, there is so much to consider. 

It has to be Gluten Free, peanut free, dairy free, vegetarian, vegan, etc. 

So when I call venues, I have to specify everything I need considered and I have a short menu to choose from. 

Maybe there wasn’t any other options. 

I mean, I feel ya. I’ve been stuck with many a salad with my gluten allergy....if they remember to leave off the croutons. But I’ve learnt to be happy that they thought of it at all. There have also been many parties I didn’t have a single thing to eat, that’s why I try so hard now. 

NAH. I understand you’re upset and I think you should be, but that could be just what they could do.

At least they had one option available."
e9yfhp,NTA. You both looked over the laptops and agreed to the trade when you met. He should have opened all basic things he was planning to use and verified they worked. It seems that he did as he agreed to the trade. If it stopped working later it sucks but he agreed to the trade and that’s a gamble he took by not buying something brand new. It seems you weren’t trying to scam him or anything so I say you’re in the clear and not the asshole is this situation.
e9yg9e,"What in the actual fuck. No, you're clearly NTA. My abusive ex used to say shit like this to me all the time. *You're my girlfriend, I should be able to be myself with you.* 

Well his self was an asshole. Complete sweetheart to strangers. Treated me like shit. Fuck that noise. 

And just because he's doubly stupid, FAS causes wide set eyes."
e9yhgy,NTA.  They can get off their lazy leeching asses and fix their shit.
e9yjhh,"NTA. Depression fucking sucks, yeah, but it's not an excuse to forget about your responsibilities. Having suffered from depression for several years, I can understand not wanting to go to a sports event because it's loud, there's a ton of people, etc., but it's not like he really has to *do* anything - he just needs to show up, do the whole manly man respectful nod every once in a while, maybe have a hot dog or a burger or some chips or something."
e9yjuq,"For the purposes of this sub, NTA, but I get the sense that she's just being a little motherly to you, and maybe doesn't realize that you're independent enough to - yknow - pay most of her salary. A little reminder won't hurt, but don't be too hardass about it."
e9ym7s,"NTA, just be cool if she says no"

e9yodq,"Originally I was going to say E SH, because:

> my mom was busy working, travelling, making money for us

but also

> she never corrected him whenever he would give her attitude but whenever i gave the slightest bit of attitude, she’d snap and i learned because of that

Sounds a lot like my own (also Asian) mother, actually.

But the more I thought about it the more I'm kind of leaning towards NTA. On one hand I'm sure she loves you, even if it's that whole strict Asian mother way. But on the other hand, providing money for one's family isn't really an act of love, it's kind of an act of obligation. Strict parenting, even in the best of intentions, can lead to offspring resentment later down the line. I get the sense that she's trying to reenter your life *because* she was absent for so long, but she doesn't realize that she doesn't have the positive memories you're supposed to associate with parents."
e9yokp,NTA. That was annoying of her.
e9yq02,"NTA.

It’s a public school, even blessings are inappropriate and unconstitutional and they know it, that’s why they backpedaled so hard.

e9yqln,NTA people who drive like him cause more accidents. Rights of way exist for a reason and its not being a nice driver.
e9ywo8,"Slight YTA, it seems like you're gonna try to force him by holding on to an old mistake over his head. I would instead ask it as a Christmas/ holiday gift."
e9yx7g,"ESH. Your parents shouldn’t expect you to help your sister with her homework all the time, but you should really change your mindset about her learning style. 

Just because *you* think something is easy doesn’t mean *she* thinks it’s easy. As someone who learns through asking a lot of questions and hearing things taught in different ways, I relate to her struggle, and I would feel terrible if somebody said some of the things you said about her about me. 

It shouldn’t be your job to teach her, but you also shouldn’t be putting her down simply for learning differently than you do."
e9yxj3,"YTA You are the pinnacle of fitness in that house. Your sister probably feels very insecure about how she doesn’t measure up to you in that regard. She comes to workout with you, makes one mistake, and you laugh your ass off at her. 

And you say you like to help and teach people? Well you probably just destroyed any chance of her ever working out with you unless you try to see it from her point of view and apologize."
e9yy27,"NTA, life is too short for non family assholes.  It’s too short for family assholes too but that’s more complicated, this isn’t, cut them out but just tell them why.  Will be awkward but less skewed than dodging them in the hall."
e9yzhp,"YWBTA. It would be a lovely gift, if your husband wanted it. Springing something he’s uncomfortable having at the office on him isn’t okay."
e9yzq7,NTA. You have to do what’s best for you. Those kids will be thrilled to have you as their teacher next year.
e9z2w6,"NTA.  All it takes is for one person to sue.  Like a swimming pool, a sledding hill could probably be considered an “attractive nuisance”.  I’m sure if you called your homeowners insurance, they would assure you that you are doing the right thing."
e9z3ai,"NTA. i can't believe every comment on here is YTA, holy sh\*t! you are totally in the right for not wanting to be friends with a homophobe. you are not playing ""thought police"" as one other commenter put it, you just dont want to be friends with someone who holds bigoted views."
e9z5pk,"NTA, she’s a grown up and should understand that you have an out of town guest. And who cares who your guest is, she can wait, and you can show up with a nice housewarming gift in a few days."
e9z5w8,"Me and my mother live with my grandma who has custody over me (my moms still angry over that) and I’m 14, she doesn’t take any meds and doesn’t go to therapy. If I could move out I definitely would but I usually settle for staying in my room, I used to go out with friends but since my friends in my town don’t like me and all of my other friends + my bf live in the next town over I’m kinda stuck at home"
e9z6nu,"NTA. If your sister doesn't want to acknowledge her son is gay, that's her (regrettable) choice. Being warm and supportive is rarely an asshole move. Plus, bringing the BF to a family gathering means the cat's out of the bag."
e9z6yk,"NTA. The other fellow decided to flout two pretty big rules. I probably wouldn't have reported him, but doing so doesn't make you an asshole. He decided to cheat, and his basic lack of consideration (leaking headphones) got him caught."
e9z6zn,NTA You're an adult and can download what you want. But sadly you can't make then pay your bill so....be sneakier?
e9z86c,NTA. Red flags. Run

However as a practical point, I suggest getting into the habit of checking before you preheat the oven, since you now know he has no common sense."
e9zgg3,"NTA, people who try to “fix” mental illness with religion are just downright disrespectful. Do what needs to be done for you, that’s all you can do"

e9ztf1,"NAH. You had no intention of being rude, you were just sticking to the norm. But you definitely need to get them gifts next year"
e9zucf,"YTA. Of course, GF is going to pick the psycho over you.  And you are playing right into the man's hands - he had been trying to undermine her relationships with her friends. She is with an older man who manipulates and belittles her at every turn. She needs her girlfriends more than ever."
e9zw6h,"NTA - As you said, you're not 100% sure yet either. You don't owe it to your company to be completely upfront about your future plans. They certainly won't tell you when they start considering layoffs."

e9zy8h,"NTA. She invited you. I’d go :)

I think you are overthinking this a lot. Just go and have a good time."
ea01gu,"YTA. 

no more than 10 nights a month, so if it was 10 that would be almost 33% of the time. He’s YOUR SO not everyone else’s and sure it’s comfortable to bring him around every now and then which they should accept but having him over too frequently would be annoying. A home is generally for privacy and just because you’re comfortable with him doesn’t mean other people should automatically accepted to be as well. Common areas especially. It’s always awkward no matter who it is when there’s a “stranger” in your kitchen/lounge and it’s not like they’re going to watch TV while you guys are sitting on the couch. 

I would compromise. You sometimes go to his and he sometimes comes to yours. It’s not “appeasing” your roommates. It’s courtesy. You are not the only one in the house and you need to be mindful of the people you’re sharing with."
ea01sy,"She’s right, she won’t have the full college experience. But it is unreasonable of her to expect you to pay for it. NTA. She can get a job and pay for campus accommodation herself if she wants."
ea020k,"NTA- you aren’t obliged to work on your relationship with your brother, especially given his historical treatment of you and your family. Anyone who tells you you’re being ‘overdramatic’ can get fucked"

ea06z8,[deleted]
ea0b2d,"NTA. at the end of the day, it’s your moms house and if she wants to stop smoking she should ask him to cut back. that’s really fucked about your sister and cat, they shouldn’t have to suffer because of him. dude sounds like a dick"
ea0ctf,"YTA

""Mike calls himself bisexual"". This sentence is what makes you an asshole. It implies that you either think Mike isn't being truthful about his sexuality or that his sexuality is something he's willingly chosen. 

For someone who tries to claim that their deeply personal beliefs don't make them think worse of others, that statement suggests a lot of judgment on your part."
ea0g5e,[deleted]
ea0h21,"NTA

You don’t have to take the test if you don’t feel like it. Outside of finding out something you don’t want to know nothing bad can happen. (Not minimizing that, just saying nothing nefarious can happen.) The test either told him this guy is his brother or it didn’t."
ea0ha0,"NTA it’s really rude to leave your crap in the dryer all day and insist people don’t touch it. You should not apologize for doing a nice thing because she is insecure about her undies. If she’s so freaked out about it she shouldn’t be using machines that she doesn’t even pay the utilities for. In EVERY way they were wrong.

Frankly I would go back in and address how leaving her stuff in the dryer all day and insisting you leave it there when she is not even a roommate is unacceptable. Forget the “I won’t do it again” say if it happens again you will remove the laundry and put it on top of the dryer. That if you need the dryer in your own home you will use it. Don’t let them walk all over you."
ea0mex,"YTA. Your dad misses his home country, and he seized his chance to go over the holiday period. It doesn't mean he doesn't love you or the rest of the family, and his granddaughter is still pretty little to really enjoy Christmas. Don't punish him by not getting him a gift. But you could just (a) get him something small and easy to post, or (b) tell him you'll give him his gift when he gets home."
ea0p8k,"NTA

ea0r9x,"NAH. This is a really uncomfortable situation to be in. There is a reason voting for stuff like this is usually anonymous and in the small scale it's to not hurt anyone's feelings. You didn't do anything wrong for nominating your English teacher and your IT teacher was following proper procedure as acting vice by getting your vote. Them being disappointed is an unfortunate consequence of a bad situation. I don't think anyone here was acting in bad faith, so no assholes. That said... god this is awkward."
ea0se3,"YTA - you had no desire to be accountable before you broke up with your ex. This very much reads as you feeling lonely rather than actually having some desire to be a better person. 

Also - you apologized for YOUR feelings, not for hers. Never, ever apologize because you think it’ll make you feel better when you’re not sure if it’ll make the other person feel better. Then you’re doing it for yourself and not for them."

ea10rt,"YTA

You don’t call her wife, why should your niece or nephew call her aunt?"
ea11hs,"NAH but I think your husband has a point. I get that people love HP but is it really necessary to name your daughter after a character in one of the most famous books of the past decade? 

Idk, do what you want but I would personally want something more unique and meaningful.

Edit: yes I understand that it was a name before the book came out but pretty much no one cares or will associate the name with anything other than the book but again, you do you."
ea17ld,"YWBTA if you unloaded on her angrily. But it would be perfectly appropriate, and a boon to any future clientele in the same situation if you tell her that her questions were intrusive and offensive and that you were paying her for her tailoring skills, not to be subjected to an interrogation."
ea1b25,NTA Sounds miserable if you make the bitchy move be prepared for less invitations to social activities. You make valid points and I’m sure you feeling the way you feel is valid I hope you get to have some fun soon
ea1d5d,"NTA. You don't have to accept this woman into your family, she's not a member and you aren't obliged to treat her like one.

That seems to be a pretty harsh interpretation.  
Personally I would also be uncomfortable with a nudist lifestyle. Of course you should do what you want, but in order to make a relationship work, both people have to compromise. It may be that this is a deal-breaker for the whole ralationship, but that does not make anyone an asshole.  
NAH"
ea2m48,"NTA...to those saying yta really?? 

 Let’s not make any bones about this, the dog is old, settled in his day to day routine. Has those with whom he is familiar around. Your son wanting to take him, whilst he may have the best intentions, it’s not fair on Toby.
 Plus as you say, he was a family pet.

Editing to add: when I posted this comment over 5 hours ago, there were a couple of people calling op ta! I got this post early. So if ta post are gone, I can’t help that."
ea2mz3,"ESH

He shouldn’t have raised his voice but “He should be punished for disrespecting me” is ridiculous"
ea2shc,"ESH but you less than your spouse. She obviously sucks big time for not only having fads of extremism in various directions but also for including her whole family in them. The animal butchering video is just too much, too. You and your spouse both suck because both of you keep doing stuff behind your backs and asking the children to be accomplices in these lies.

ea3y3o,"NTA, he was put there for a reason. If he’s showing no change of character, his ex should be warned."
ea3ya6,"NAH.  She didn't say you were her second choice.  She said you guys are lucky that the situation lined up as she almost dated someone else around the time you two met.  I don't think she meant it at all the way your thinking, but I can understand why your bugging about it.  From my read of it, you need to take a deep breath and remember that she is choosing to be with you.  You guys have what you describe as a 'good' relationship.  She has a history before you guys got together and you do too.  Did you have anyone you were interested in dating around the time you met L?  It's not any different.  If you confront her about it, I think it'd be a mistake."
ea3yx9,"Welcome to having a baby. Everyone's exhausted and crabby and it sucks. NAH, this is all pretty normal tbh."
ea3zfg,"NTA

Maybe there's a bit of jealousy/nerves about the new baby at play here? Realistically, your kids have way shorter school days than anyone I know so I have to assume you're not in the US. My 5 year old starts at 8:40 and goes until 3:30, which is pretty standard."
ea49eq,"NTA.  

Showering before work is a normal thing.  And 6:30 is a perfectly appropriate time to take a shower.  If you were constantly taking them at 3am just for fun it might be weird, but I don’t think you have anything to feel bad about here.  No one wants a stinky coworker!"
ea4ajd,NTA: you can’t clean up urine when you’re working with/around food. That’s a huge sanitary no no. She should know that and do her own job.
ea4awg,YTA it's literally her cat. And it's unlikely that cuddling the cat triggered her asthma attack. I have asthma too and if it's going to get triggered it's not going to have a 12+ hour delay.
ea4bsq,NTA. Your SIL is TA.
ea4bzh,">I declined but she kept insisting that I should participate until she gave up and called me a grinch. AITA for refusing to participate?

NTA. You refused an optional event. You don't need a reason, and they've got no right to pester you over it."
ea4d4y,"ESH- you’re the asshole for holding a comment YOUR husband made against her. If you had a problem with your husband calling her hot, then the problem lies with the husband not the woman. She’s the asshole for commenting on your age. No one should talk negatively or judge other people’s pregnancy journey because it’s very personal and often very difficult. 

Do I think this is worth making every family event awkward and uncomfortable by holding on to this? No. So far it doesn’t seem as if you’ve approached her about her comments. You should sit her down and have a conversation about how you treat each other. It’s worth putting in the effort, and if she responds negatively, then you can say you tried to fix the relationship and she wasn’t open to it. As much as you don’t like someone, you gotta put in the effort to fix things at least one time because this puts the whole family in an awkward position. If that attitude isn’t reciprocated, then you have the right to continue ignoring her."
ea4dlq,"YTA and your mom is TA

If it weren't for the fact that you acknowledged your mom blatantly favored you, only she would be TA. This is the kind of shit that leaves families strained. You can appreciate what your mother does for you, and also stand up for your siblings who also get treated unfairly."
ea4e40,"NTA. They were right to be concerned about your wellbeing, but it was 15 seconds, and as pranks go, that was a good one.

ea5j26,"YTA for involving yourself so much in this. She's having the baby, not you. I understand being disapproving, having a baby as a teenager without a lot of financial support, and not living on your own, but those issues aren't really any of your concern.

this is called camping. your meal is over and you're now squatting on a table the restaurant needs to seat and feed more people. it's rude to the employees and it's rude to anyone waiting for that table.

a few minutes is fine, but a half hour is excessive. ""we're paying customers"" does not give you free reign to be an asshole."
ea5msp,"YTA. Have a frank conversation with your dad. Communicate these concerns to him. That y’all feel like you’ve tried, but that it seems like she’s totally disinterested. Maybe even say “you know, if she doesn’t want to come, it wouldn’t hurt my feelings if she decided to do something else, but know that the two of you are welcome.” Or maybe something like “hey, maybe this year drive separately, and if she doesn’t feel comfortable around us for long periods of time, she can leave early and you can stay a little longer? She just may not be comfortable with larger groups of people or in social settings. 

They are a package deal. I don’t think her behavior rises to the level of “she can’t come, but you can.” This would be a different situation if she arrived and always insulted or belittled everyone, or was hurtful. She, unfortunately for everyone it seems like, is a part of the family.

When he is stalking and harassing girls, does anyone do or say anything to address this behaviour? I'm really worried about how these girls fears and feelings might be being ignored and how badly this could escalate if not addressed.

To use your analogy, yes it is courteous to pay. However if no one steps up, and you don’t say anything, it’s tough to ask them once all the pizza is gone to pay. Because by the time consumption has started, the payment terms are locked in. 

You did the shopping, they had no say in what your purchased or made. Gathering money in advance and then shopped with that would have been ideal. 

I would ask them to lay off the leftovers however."

So, as someone who is more than a foot shorter than you, I dont think you're the asshole.

I attended a lot of alternative rock concerts when I was in high school as a 5 foot 2 inch 105lb girl. I've been squished into the front railing before to the point where I had bruises and it was hard to breathe for a few days afterwards. That being said, you got to your spot(from what I can tell) without shoving people out of the way, you followed the natural movement of the crowd as the bands switched. It's not your fault that this guy didn't do the same and find himself at a better position. Just because you're 6+ feet tall doesnt mean that you deserve any less of a concert experience than others. Short people aren't guaranteed front row spots and shouldnt expect a taller person to stand in the back of a crowd when one of their favorite bands are playing.

This is a super tricky situation. 

You have every right to want to be celebrated on your special day, especially for a party that had so much effort put into its careful planning. You don't deserve to be brushed off once again for unforeseen circumstances outside of your control.

Your grandmother being in the hospital is a big deal to your parents, your party is a big deal to you. They can't expect you to cancel and not feel put out, and you can't expect them to not want to be there for her in her time of need.

 You said your grandma was admitted but not critical. If she was, I'd say you don't have a choice but to postpone. Since that's not the case, another adult can be at the party to ""supervise"" to satisfy your parents. You can also be sympathetic and mature by taking a little time during your party to check in with them on how things are going and show your love for your parents, even though you have little for your grandma."

For her to say that she knows how a grieving mother feels because she lost her dog was another and inappropriate however well intended. She needed to be set straight before she said that to someone else who has lost a child who might have really torn into her.

Although the Kuerig seems a little petty but that's fine by me since I can be petty as hell.


Edit to OP's edit: Be extra petty and let the other new guy use your Keurig and tell him your circumstances.

Calling every hour to see if you are alright is not caring, concern, or loving too much. It is controlling.

This is a Schrodinger's joke -- it was going to be either a joke or not depending on how offended you were. This is incredibly hurtful, and from the end of your post it sounds like it's only the latest in a variety of hurtful jokes and actions by your family.

You're a grown adult with a husband. You two would be allowed to stay on your own for Christmas even if this hadn't happened. Tell them that if they want you there, they owe you an earnest apology. People have this messed up belief that if something was a joke you aren't allowed to be hurt or offended by it, but that's ridiculous.

Changing the volume on the radio just ain’t that hard. From her post you have some time off whilst she works night shifts right now, and she’s enjoying having the car pre warmed for her. Why don’t you get any enjoyment knowing she’s happy getting into a warm car at 3am? 

Seems like this is a primary issue because you’re off, if you were at work you’d be driving your car and her hers and this wouldn’t be an issue. 

When you work away for extended periods of time would she also not be allowed to drive your car? Just seems a bit mean. Like she saved to pay off her loan early so you could purchase a new car, with the idea it would be primarily yours, but it seems like you don’t want her using it even if you’re not. Like I’d understand if you weren’t getting to drive it at all, but that’s not the case."

Being a bridesmaid is expensive, just like everything else to do with a wedding. One does it because one loves the person getting married.

Your sister hasn't actually done anything wrong. Your wife just doesn't like her.

If they can't afford a home, they can't afford a child. Only shitty people **purposefully** have children when their life isn't in order yet (being able to provide all basic needs for a themselves).

If the child was a legit accident or they were in a good position, had a baby, and then some bad luck came around, it'd be a different story. Shit happens and I'm not going to judge people as assholes for situations that are out of their control. But if she and her husband **try** for a baby right now, they suck."
eaq6kf,"Nah. It was a bad financial idea to move out there without selling or renting out your prior house beforehand.

I think you should do what it takes to sell or rent out the farm, provided your husband's job is stable. I only say this because I think your family would benefit from the move more than staying, provided your husband intends to continue working there. 5 and 7 will adjust fine and a bigger city brings more opportunity for friends, sports, education. It seems to me that small cities tend to be more close minded and children think they need to stay in the small town more so when they graduate. Its not choosing one group over the other. If anything, it should have been harder for your older kids."
eaqb0a,"First if she is your dad's kid she is your half sister and not your step sister. You can have a great relationship with her with out liking the mom, I am coming from a place of experience here. Me and my half sister have a great relationship and always has.

earc9o,"YTA - he had a valid reason and you made it a problem...the rest is a result of your own actions. Look at it from his perspective. He quite literally was trying to save a person's life and you somehow made it about you? I get that you had a date but this isnt something you get to be upset about while still being reasonable and he was being overly worried because IMO you're reaction doesn't make sense.

Edit: dont downvote her for admitting she was in the wrong, no need to do that."
earh0f,"NTA  I think your assessment of the situation is spot-on. He needs someone in his corner, and that person is you. Perhaps you can go with him to buy a car and help him out that way if she insists he can't keep the money. And there is no problem treating him and his step-daughter differently. Your relationship is different -- you hardly know her. They aren't little kids anymore and they can deal with that.

EDIT: Thank you for the silver! If I could pass it on to the grandson, I would."
earnhs,"YTA

Mate, you want to live in seperate apartments to save an extra few minutes commuting? That is bizarre.

I'm not really seeing how the sleeping patterns even come into play, if one of you is already asleep then the other will just get into bed whenever. It's not like you have to go to wake the other person up and announce that you are going to sleep?

earwza,"NAH  I know how you feel. The last thing I want to do after work is hang out with people from my company. I like them but would prefer to go home and get into PJs. That said, it is a good idea to stop by some of the events for at least a little while. People notice (as your manager did)."
eary0a,[deleted]
earyqn,NAH but just because it doesn’t make you the AH doesn’t mean you shouldn’t send the gift. Maybe it’s just the kindness that will bring him back into the family. If it’s not a financial hardship you should just do it in the spirit of holiday giving
earzb3,"NAH. You have the right to choose who comes.  He’s likely trying to support you in your accomplishments, which is nice.

Your mom is just concerned and wants to know who you're hanging around and possibly influencing the person you are growing up to become. I think your evasiveness probably made the situation much worse than it actually is. Your mom is, more than likely, imagining all kinds of crazy, frightening, and menacing details. That's what moms do, we worry. 

Maybe try explaining it to her like you explained it to us. You're seem very articulate and thoughtful. Just tell her,

""mom, I love you and I know you want to know all the details about Hannah. I get that and understand why. Hannah's been through some sensitive and private things, which she has told me about in confidence. I'm trying to be a good friend and a person with integrity so I'm really uncomfortable breaking her confidence, even to you. Let me talk to her and se what Hannah thinks.

In other words, he was saying that the closer who cocked up deals with the flak and possible resentment. I didn't think he meant that the closer had to pay the mistake out of their own pocket.

This isn’t “revoking an offer”, the loan’s already been made. There’s also apparently no question that he will still pay you back on the agreed time frame. He’s not being profligate or financially irresponsible, he’s made a logical argument that he feels he needs to make this donation for practical political reasons for his re-election campaign and that if he’s not re-elected he stands to lose much more than a few thousand $. He’d apparently already budgeted this donation in and for him it’s part of the cost of doing business (of being an elected official). You may disagree with his decision or his logic but it’s not irrational, and you don’t get veto power over all his financial decision-making just because you gave him what is a fairly small loan.

You're right - it's going to take more than one session to break down her walls and get her to understand therapy and for it to help.

But all these people saying shit like she will resent you, YTA for making her do something she doesn't want, etc.  Hell, one comment says you are TA for not respecting the 13-year-old's wishes. 

Are you fucking kidding me?  She's a god damn child.  Children often have to do things they don't like or don't want.  She is not an adult and sometimes we have to do things we don't like because it's good for us.  A petulant, hormonal 13 year old girl doesn't get to make this decision.  And if it does end up helping her, she will not only NOT resent you, as someone else claimed, she will thank you for it later.

You are most certainly NOT TA for parenting your child.  Kids resent a lot of things their parents force them to do. 
 Like eating vegetables.  They might resent you for it.  That doesn't mean you stop doing it because the kid doesn't like vegetables.

It's not like you are doing something abusive or inappropriate.  This is within the normal realm and right of parenting.

Do you live together, or do you not?  It seems as if you both are unsure of the answer to this question.  While I don't think you're the asshole for wanting alone time, really think about whether you are compatible with someone who doesn't seem to understand this need that you have.  The reason I say ESH is because you want this from him, but you aren't willing to give him alone time either.  I think you two really need to sit down and properly plan things out, determine whether you actually 100% live together or not, and then from there decide how to meet each others' needs.  If it truly is YOUR place and not his, then he shouldn't really be there unless you invite him there and make plans with him there, but this doesn't seem to be your arrangement."

There is no religious talk allowed period. If she brings it up she will be asked to leave. I will give her one chance. If she insults my home, my partner, or relationship, she will never be invited back. 

I love you and want to have you in my home but I deserve and demand respect. If she can not agree to this rule she can not come and I hope you will still come because I want to share my life with you."

eb2d46,"NTA - as someone who came from an abusive household with parents who have zero regard to how all the fighting affected the kids I have a few things to share. 

First, everyone processes trauma differently. My older sister normalized all the abuse and she’s still able to have a relationship with my mom. Whenever I see my mom I have a mental break down for weeks. I think your siblings are in the category where they’ve learned to normalize this behavior. That’s why they can’t understand your reaction. I want to point out that you have every right to not want to celebrate Christmas and your dad is extremely selfish, among many other choice words that is insulting. 

Second, Is there someone outside your immediate family you can speak to about this? If you can find a safe space to go to for the holiday would be best. I used to leave when things got bad and would stay at a friends house for a few nights. 

It’s hard being a kid and having parents who refuse to acknowledge your well being. I hope the best for you."
eb2e2u,"I just got married, I understand the stress and the hard decisions that have to be made. You are going to get a lot of ""it's your wedding, your rules"" which while technically the truth can leave a lot of hurt feelings. IMO if you decided not to invite your mother's siblings, your father's sibling should have also not been invited. Also, I think a reasonable person would take the statement of ""We don't want to do Christmas this year"" as you guys aren't participating in Xmas day or eve... I am not sure why you thought it wouldn't be taken in that way. These are events on different days, a week apart, why don't you go to both? 

Your mom's text might have been harsh, but as far as family politics go she is probably right. You should make an appearance. 

NAH"
eb2k22,"NTA there is literally no excuse for swearing at a child. Just be careful when commenting on other parents parenting style as the child may suffer the consequences of your input.

Emotionally immature parents grind my gears. I grew up with parents who could not control themselves or their emotions.
When they were angry they would yell and hit. If somebody had said something like OP did, it would have angered them more....and I would have been yelled at more, or even hit more. It sucks being the child of abusive parents, nobody deserves that"
eb2o1a,"Clearly your brother and SIL have a massive communication problem

I'm leaning towards a soft YWBTA because it's not really your business, and honestly what do you actually think it'll accomplish? You really don't think your SIL wouldn't cut you out of their lives like your mum if you confronted her?

I'd recommend r/relationship_advice more though"

eb2w0n,NTA. Make a plan to live elsewhere cause it sounds like he might be back on a permanent basis.
eb2y0s,"NTA. Seriously, if your parents are complaining about the monetary value of **your gift** then they are definitely the asshole. You make far less than your sibling, and therefore your disposable income is far less. The fact is you're giving up more of a % your disposable income than your brother."
eb2z3h,"You seem oddly obsessed with your cousin. Your nickname is ilovemycousin, you wrote songs about her, you manipulated her boyfriend etc...

eb3027,NTA.   You defined the terms and she signed the paper. Clear and simple. Seems like a validation post.
eb313d,"NTA.  People like Rachel get people like your friends killed.  If she wants to party and be unsafe when there are literally safe options handed to her on a silver platter (someone else calling an uber, you volunteering to be DD, you even coming to pick them up), then she has to deal with the consequences, even if that means losing a friend."
eb315h,"NTA.

Typically when you give a gift you also give a gift receipt. And it’s not like you left them guessing what you wanted. 

A watch like other jewelry is an expression of your style. If you don’t like this watch, returning it seems reasonable to me.

I may have waited a few days before asking for the gift receipt though so as not to cause a fuss during the main event."
eb345p,"NTA, the next time she pulls something like that on you while you’re driving? Offer to pull over and let her get out of the car. Sounds to me like she doesn’t appreciate not having to walk."
eb34xu,"YTA...unless you are actually giving them the products...I think some homemade cookies/seasoned nuts/other baked good is probably better if you wanna go completely cheap and homemade. Pair it with a hand written, heartfelt card and everyone will love it! 

It just seems like this information is something you should share with your family anyway in a non-gift context. It doesnt seem very festive or gifty to focus on a skin care routine without actually providing products or framing it as a ""luxury"" or ""pamper yourself thing""."

eb3qox,"So I am confused here: 

> I wasn’t asked to be a bridesmaid, but have accepted it and moved on 

How did this even happen then? Was there a bridesmaid draft and your number was called?

Anyways onto what you are actually asking about.... Being invited to a wedding can be super expensive, even more so if you are actually \*in\* the wedding; I don't think a lot of people realize that as they are planning. Honestly getting out of a  bachelorette party in another state for $650 would be optimistic based on what all I am seeing here. 

So a big **NTA** \- it honestly sounds like you are tepid about even *attending* the wedding let along being in it as a bridesmaid.

A simple explanation that you cannot financially pull this off at the moment should be more than enough for anyone who considers you a friend, if they lose it over that then they probably aren't someone you want in your life anyways, but at least you know before you buy a dress you will never wear again."

eb45k5,"YTA; they didn't sign up for a fourth roommate, yet they got one. He's also using the facilities in your house freely, resulting in higher costs. They are pretty lenient by suggesting 20 dollars a week. I'd seriously just be pissed if I had an extra person living at my house 4 days a week. They don't want to pay for your sexlife, it's reasonable. If you're going to refuse it you should find a middle ground when it comes to the visits (50% of the time at his place)."

eb4j6i,"NAH

Even with the same diagnosis, the way things manifest and the way people deal (or don’t deal) can vary greatly. It’s not a competition and some people are able to be more functional than others. Often, those who are more functional are using every bit of energy to do so because they DON’T have the option not to. And that is exhausting too.

It’s absolutely fair to say “I love you, I care about you, and I know you’re struggling. These are frustrations and concerns best discussed with a professional.  Until you’re ready to work on these issues, I’d ask that you stop bringing them to me. I’ll support you as you make changes to improve the situation if and when you do, but until then,  these conversations do nothing but compromise my own gains and I can’t do the emotional labor for us both.”

To be honest, it’s really hard to keep a relationship together when you both have significant emotional and mental health needs. It’s like trying to save a drowning person who is climbing up you for air and pushing you down when you aren’t yourself a strong swimmer:

Maybe a few months’ break would be wise? Each of you focus on your own needs and then reevaluate in 60-90 days?

He already has a soft place to fall. You don’t. You can’t carry him through this. 

Hang in there."
eb4jrb,YTA just because you were raised in a toxic environment doesn't mean you should carry that into your future house hold.
eb4o1e,"NTA. This what I don't understand about these churches who ""help"" people. I have to put my thoughts in bullet points:

* Just because they are a church, doesn't mean they absolutely have to teach their religion.
* Why offer to help people if they are really using this as an opportunity to feed their agenda to force their religion on others?
* Getting help with English is very difficult even today. You take what you can get, in the hope that people will understand and respect your background/ethnicity. That being said, I recommend that they go to any local community colleges in your area, and ask if they are offering English classes for free. Most community colleges offer these free English classes, and they will be about the actual language, not religion."
eb4rlo,"NTA From what you wrote, I wouldn’t entrust your dad to take care of a pet turtle for a week, let alone your child."
eb4sjl,"NTA - because it’s reflexive, but I’d recommend that either you take the wheel, or your partner takes extra classes because if he’s not being an aware driver he’s putting everyone on the road at risk of injury - and you never know the next time might not be a near miss, but instead an actual collision."
eb4t1m,NTA that’s super annoying if she does it over and over
eb4v3p,"NTA. Yeah it’s nice to help someone out when they need it, but this is just excessive. Those kids aren’t your responsibility and you have a life to live. It’s totally understandable to be upset especially when you weren’t told the whole truth of the situation."

eb54x9,"I would say NAH. My husband and I live in the same house and some days (because of our schedules) we're lucky if we get an hour and a half to talk. She's realizing the frustrations of a long distance relationship and comparing your relationship to non long distance relationship. That's not fair, but I don't think she's being an asshole either. Just being frustrated at the limitations that come with LDRs.  Just keep up open and honest communication.

>While he was completely unresponsive, my sister and mother would dress him up in “festive” outfits for holidays. He was like a life size doll they could dress up. 

It sounds like you think this is a bad thing. Why? It sounds like they were working hard and taking care of him while he was alive. Alzheimer's is a horrible disease."
eb5av5,"YTA - Yes it is half your house, but it's not like he is asking to move all these guys in! It's one night! It's his birthday! Just tell him to clean up any of the mess. Just go hang out with your friends and let them have their fun.  You can be a stick in the mud when you turn 60."

After two years you should know her friends or at least know of them well enough to know who to invite to a party. She's correct in saying that you need to think of how the group will flow.

eb5gq4,YTA.  They’re not yours.  You said they belong to your parents.
eb5imy,"NTA. You can't drive because of trauma, you need to really get a hold on that at some point.

eb5jys,NTA.  The kitchen is a family area.  If she wants solitude she should go to her room or the library.
eb5p3y,"YTA. There was no reason for you to embarrass him like that, especially since he thinks she’s *just* a friend to you. 

I don’t understand why you couldn’t have told her in private about his crush, OR talked to him in private, saying, “Hey, please stop flirting with Amy. She’s not interested.”"
eb5pf4,"NTA. 

What you're doing is wonderful. And your good boi doesn't sound like he's hard core stressing over anything. If he was getting growly and aggressive, then obviously thing should have to be reconsidered. But as is, sounds like he's overall ok with things."
eb5php,NTA.  Everyone should get an equal amount of time for break.
eb5r1o,YTA. I don’t understand why his lifestyle of keeping things has to be overruled by your lifestyle of throwing things away. There needs to be a compromise that doesn’t involve him needing to get rid of something he clearly loves.

eb65gx,"NTA, your brother is. For me, it seems a bit selfish to feel like you can bring an additional guest with you when you yourself are a guest in someone's home.

eb6kq2,NTA - This was borderline cruel. Your friend sounds like a smegstain.
eb6nfc,"NTA *But* if you’re going to be on your own as an adult you will need to take the plunge and start setting and reinforcing those boundaries. That means consequences for when they break the rules you’ve set. 

I don’t think you’re being a coward with how you’re getting out, though. That sounds more like sheer survival. You also sound like you’ve got a good head on your shoulders.

eb7ve8,NTA. You have shitty roommates but they’re adults so you can’t exactly make them behave.

Quit being a jerk and support your brother.  He is the one getting cancer tests, not you."
eb7zpb,"I can imagine how hurt you must be. You've given years of your life to your grandparents when no one else could or would, and she gives your parents $30K and you only $100.

I'm inclined to say NTA."
eb7zxf, ESH.  You and the other friends for not asking him if you could get his order while you went inside to get yours.  He's also an asshole for not asking you to get food for him instead of pouting about it.
eb82me,ESH but you sound like a real joy to be around
eb835w,NTA and lmao at their refusal to sign that paper. It doesn’t matter if they sign it or not. They have zero power over you and your landlord can let you out of your lease regardless.
eb84m3,"NTA. You don't know the kid, you don't know what he's allowed to eat or not. And if his guardian was saying ""no more"", that's what was meant. The kid was trying to manipulate you. Being deaf doesn't mean a person needs your pity. (I say this as a Deaf person myself.)"

eb8nxa,"Why don't you do things with him? Instead of implying that he's fat, go for a bike ride with him. Play basketball. Do stuff. Probably be good for you too. Model good exercise and eating habits. Instead of bribing him, just make exercise and healthy eating the norm.

eb93v8,"YTA 

You put your children in the position of hiding their relationships from you by making such a ridiculous rule as ""No dates from high school"".
If they've been together over seven years they're basically common law married anyway. 

You can make up for the frankly horrible parent child relationship you've created, by being present and celebrating with your children. 
They don't owe you anything, and they don't have to include you in their lives. Your wife is absolutely right. If you want any future relationship with them, you need to put your misplaced bitterness aside and just be happy for them."
eb9417,"YTA - It sounds completely harmless. If you find the over-sexualisation an issue that's just your opinion, and you don't have the right to affect his excitement and entertainment if it doesn't directly affect you.

I sincerely doubt he's doing it for masturbation. It's more likely that-

A) He's just collecting the skins and isn't really interested in how they look.

or

B) He just likes the aesthetics of them."
eb947i,"Nta- but you're mom enabled an abuser and allowed him to abuse you for years. She is still doing that. I wouldn't want anyone that allowed me to be abused in my, even if it were my mother. 
You may find more space to heal away from her and him."
eb971n,"YTA. Logic =/= compassion, empathy, or rightness. You're buying into one of the worst aspects of school which is intense competition for those sweet, ultimately meaningless trophies instead of the true, valuable gifts you can provide as a caring mentor.

eb9d83,"YTA you knew how she would feel about that and you didn't care because of your own desires. You know that's selfish. I'm sorry you're not well mentally but if someone has a problem with that and you're pursuing a relationship with them, you need to tell them."
eb9gjs,"NTA. Being drunk doesn't give you the right be stupid and say shit.

eb9obb,"NTA its your house and your event you can choose who you wanna invite. Also she sounds like a **MAJOR** pain in the ass

Side note: Why are you still friends with her?

>privately telling people full on lies about me, and calling me names

This would be the end of any friendship for me. 

&#x200B;

> private messaging my bf calling me toxic and manipulative, telling him he deserved better than me, and accusing me of talking about her behind her back. 

This would be war."
eb9om1,"NAH. It seems like you may have said that to him because you were a bit frazzled in the moment. Could you be bi? Absolutely. But you’re 15. The great thing about 2019 is that there are so many labels you can use to describe yourself to others. Plus you’re young! You can figure it out at your own pace. Look up some different sexualities and see if any of them click. You may realize you aren’t bi and that’s fine too. 

I don’t think you’re an asshole and I don’t think your friend would consider you an asshole if you just said “Hey, I think I may be bi but I’m not totally sure.” The circumstances of how everything happened might’ve been awkward but your friend seems very caring. If you decided to clarify, I think he would be understanding. And if one day you told him that you were straight or pan or any number of other things I’m sure he’d be right by your side again. I’m fairly certain you aren’t lying for attention. These things are confusing — take a breath and cut yourself some slack. :)"
eb9r69,NTA- Holocaust Jokes arent funny.
eb9sbv,"NTA, use the excuse that you are double booked and apologize for missing.  Frankly, the company should be picking up the tab for the party.  This shouldn’t be costing you anything."
eb9u4c,I think this is a NAH situation. What's happening sucks but the people are just cooking food in their own home and likely aren't intentionally trying to piss you off. It could be worth it to talk to your super to see if anything can be done about the ventilation.
eb9ycf,ESH - this relationship sounds exhausting
eba0hu,"NTA. They said it was okay if you said no and it wasn't a big deal, but now your sister is guilting you over even saying maybe. Its fucked up for her to hang the possible death of her child over your head. Also, it's literally just a name to them. You have a personal connection with your name, they don't. They can pick another one that's unique and pretty sounding without using yours."
eba4f8,"NAH unless someone reacts poorly to your decision, you shouldn’t always put career over family and friends but in this situation it’s fair to save up, some people might not like it but I feel like it’s fair"
eba662,NTA. They were trying to force her into doing something and you're a good sibling for giving her a place to stay instead of making her deal with them.
ebaau2,NTA but you already knew that right? You already convinced she cheated on you so the next step would be to break up. I know its a pretty sucky situation to be in but you're pretty much here for validation
ebaayb,"ESH. What kind of parents make their 30 year children limit themselves to a 20 dollar gift? Let everyone buy what they want to buy. If your alcoholic brother can’t afford an expensive gift, that’s okay, he can give something cheaper but meaningful. I was agreeing with you until you shit on your brother for not wanting a better job. Some people are completely content with a minimum wage job. Look around you, McDonald’s workers and cashiers exist, and not all of them are teenagers looking for some extra money. If your brother doesn’t want to pursue a meaningful career, that’s his prerogative. Buy what you want for your brothers and don’t let your parents tell you otherwise."
ebagbz,"NAH

You can charge what you want, but if your rates are absurdly low, it makes sense why other contractors would be upset with you. It sounds like you don't need this gig to support your lifestyle or pay the bills, but thats probably not true for others. Personally, I think you should re-evaluate what your time is worth but its all up to you."
ebaifl,If anything he's the asshole for trying to get more money out of you. Sure you could have said it in a nicer tone but you had your reasons.
ebak1i,"YTA

They are doing you a huge kindness by offering you a place to stay. You are saving a considerable amount of money. Having your food personally delivered to your bedroom? The homeowner probably felt like your manservant. 

""Accidentally""???

These apps have ETA times. Get off your butt and be ready to pick it up yourself, your excuse sucks."
ebampu,"YTA.

Hear me out. The woman was okay with her copy being damaged if she got to pay less. She didn't want a pristine copy. If not her, someone else would have been stuck with the damaged book, or else it might have been thrown away. There was no official policy saying it had to be the last copy for her to get the discount. I'm not saying you were an asshole per se, but in this situation you unnecessarily created conflict hence the YTA judgment."
ebap5l,"ESH. Nobody should have blown up at each other, no need to escalate the situation."
ebapdx,"This is not an advice sub.

NAH. It seems to me that your MIL is trying to pamper you guys a little mostly because you are financially struggling. I see it as a kind gesture."
ebaqmc,"Honestly, what did I just read. 

This can’t be possible. Your boyfriend cant be both obsessed with the dentist, and unable to brush his teeth. 

99.9% sure this is fake. Unless there’s some unexplained reason he continually goes to the dentist."
ebaqz2,"NTA

You're clearly unhappy being around them, and they're obviously dismissive of your presence, so cutting them off wouldn't be wrong or bad for you to do. You should never just stick around people who you don't actually feel happy to be around."
ebardi,"NAH

You were at a busy event and you forgot about your friend. And you acknowledge you forgot about your friend.

If she means something you should acknowledge their feelings and let them know the truth, that it's nothing to do with an appreciation of them.

So far it seems fair. She felt abandoned and you did abandon her. If you don't apologize you would be an asshole, if she continued to be mad after the apology she would be the asshole. 

How is everyone now?"
ebaub2,"NTA - your freezer, your rules. Just be nice when you ask her to move her stuff, perhaps offer to help her move it somewhere more convenient since you live on different floors."

ebbba6,"NTA
If she ignored you before and expects you to drop everything for her no just plain no. You don't need her to be social anymore. She would more than likely make plans with you and not show which is rude, annoying and a dick move. Stick to your guns darling she only wants you when it suits her"
ebbbvf,"YTA. Big time lmao

ebbgdo,"NTA: assuming it wont cost your current roommate anything.   


Some people make good friends and terrible roommates. Some make great roommates and terrible friends. It's tough to find both. This is just part of early adulthood, you learn the habits you can live with, literally."

You sound like a child. You're still getting a gift ... it shouldn't be too much for you to wait one more night for that to happen."
ebbon1,"NTA since you have to grieve your own way, but keep in mind that they are grieving too and might want you there to patch things up and have a fresh start."
ebbq1m,"NTA. Like at all. You are 100% right to be upset she unapologetically took away your right to make an informed choice knowing full well that she could get pregnant against your clearly expressed wishes, failed to properly communicate a very relevant issue to your sex life for several weeks, and violated your trust. It's a terrible thing to do to a partner and any resulting children. Please exercise caution engaging in sexual activity with her in the future so that there aren't anymore nasty surprises. Since you're sure about not wanting children, you should consider a vascectomy for best results."
ebbqzc,"NTA, assuming you were polite in your response there's no need to feel bad about turning down her invitation. It was a nice gesture on her part originally but she's being an asshole by pushing you on this. Personally there are few things I'd rather do less than spend an entire day with another persons family on Christmas."
ebbr10,"NAH

Sounds like you're trying to joke around when she's not in the mood ... Maybe stop telling jokes when she's not in the mood to laugh ...? 

If you're having trouble 'reading the room', certainly just stopping w/ the jokes may be the best option"
ebbutr,"NTA

Just stop for a second. Is getting someone a necklace with their name on it going to upstage all the other gifts? 

Don't even make it a question. Make it a statement. Say out loud ""Getting someone a necklace with their name on it will upstage all their other gifts.""

I don't know about you but the more I say it the funnier the idea becomes. So don't take the opinion of someone saying such funny things too seriously. Or at all."
ebbv1u,"YTA

Who appointed you charger police with authority to conduct warrantless searches?"
ebbvey,"NTA - This argument doesn’t make any sense. You are all already paying for the spot and it’s not like either of them can use it so of course you should be able to park their. Now, because you have the only car, you should be sometimes willing to help them out like driving to help pick up groceries or something but you definitely shouldn’t have to be their personal taxi now"
ebbx1u,NAH couples can be a package deal sometimes but it’s not unreasonable to ask for time without the significant other. If they are someone who mostly hangs out with their significant other you may just not be compatible as friends and that’s ok too.
ebbxxz,"When I was younger, I picked out my own birthday cake and my mom bought it for me.  You’re a grown-up, and don’t need anyone else to buy your cake - you can do it yourself.  Just buy your own cake.  It’s obvious your husband likes the ice cream cake, so let him have his and you can have yours.

I mean, of course his parents are going to care more about his birthday than yours.  He’s their son, and you’re the in-law.

NAH"
ebbzvn,"NTA

What kind of assholes basically decided how you're going to spend an entire day, then get offended when you tell them you don't want to go? I have bad migraines in loud environments, so I can somewhat relate. If someone just decided I was going to a game because they bought tickets before even asking, I'd have some choice words for them. You handled this very reasonably."

I will NEVER understand people who won't do something so small to support a friends dreams. 

I may of course be biased, because I had the same problem when self-publishing my first book; it was completely free to download - and my friends and family still didn't do it. I've never understood that. I didn't even ask them to read it - just to download.

So yeah, if you REALLY can't make yourself care enough to listen and give feedback, at least let it play without listening."
ebcnes,"NTA - You absolutely made the right decision maybe it will open his eyes. I'm fully supportive that *most* people try things in their life, I did, I was hooked on drugs from the age of 14 years old. I was taking amphetamine before school... so trust me, I know. 

Unfortunately my wake up call wasn't as easy as most, my close friend overdosed on a night fuelled with cocaine and ecstasy... but we never thought anything of it, we'd been doing it for years, no harm can come of it it's just all scare tactics. But it isn't. He can no longer think for himself, he can no longer share life and it's precious moments. 

Your sister saying that isn't justifying that your son is taking a very dangerous drug, and in a very dangerous time. It isn't the party age anymore. The person that money goes to doesn't care if they live or die, it's all about the money.. They have no clue what they're putting in their bodies and this is what makes it dangerous. 

I hope your son can see sense, but you're far from an asshole caring for your child.

PS - Don't listen to your sister."

ebcsqc,"I’m gonna say ESH. I think a lot of older people are completely absurd about the whole “respect and manners” shit, but you purposely instigated and annoyed him to prove a point when you probably should’ve just went along with it especially since you’re very new in the relationship and you’re meeting her parents for the first time, all of which should mean you be more formal and respectful anyway."

I obviously have no way to prove this, but I cannot believe that he felt let down by you. Anyone who has ever loved a child would only want what’s best for that child. Staying home was best for you.

Dad’s are dad’s. They do annoying embarrassing stuff.

But in your case they also do amazing things that are in line with your interests. A signing with a fav musician? Blessed.

Your heart is closed now, it has to be because of your reaction. Instead open it to appreciation of what he does. He did something great. Maybe he wants some recognition for that. Ever take a minute to really think about why? There are other aspects of his life unfulfilled. 

So if this is where he is getting his fulfillment from, would it kill you to just love him? Why can’t you add on to the post I did have an amazing time, thank you and I love you.

ebe12h,"YTA. 

Giving and receiving gifts is a form of communication.

 If you want your family to understand you better you need to make the effort to give gifts, and receive them graciously. 

More fundamentally you need to talk to them openly and honestly.  Work up to explaining you feel left out and forgotten about.

If you want them to spend meaningful time with you then you need to make an effort. Invite them for meals or days out individually. Make conversation. Set time aside to chat about their lives. Listen to them. Put the work in. Most people love to be listened to.  Your time and attention is much more important than gifts. Give them that and you will get the same in return, and rebuild your relationships.

Good luck."

If he cusses a lot and gets mad when other people cuss, he's definitely a hypocrite, so he's an asshole for that, but if a FRIEND is asking you to stop doing something that makes them uncomfortable when they're around, it's kinda a dick move to keep doing it. And you're an asshole for how you handled it."
ebgtc2,"NTA and your MIL needs to learn that, while yes it's her grandchild, she's not the parent.

>she would get very defensive and say that we were being too possessive of our daughter

and what? It's literally your newborn child... 

A ton of parents I know don't like the whole social media thing, and your MIL needs to respect your decision. It's not like she doesn't have pics of her grandchild, she just wants to post them online to get attention and those sweet-sweet likes haha"
ebgux0,NTA. You are not an extension of your mother. You deserve to pursue and chase your dreams. Sad to know that you have an unsupportive mom.
ebh0ad,"NTA. 

Your ex is 100% the asshole for three things. 

1) Scheduling shit on your time (that's not a weekly activity)
2) Telling your daughter before talking to you
3) Letting your daughter be the one to ask you about it. 

Your ex is an ass."
ebha4e,"Noooooo NTA stop her right away, if your fiancè does NOT want this you need to stand the hell up and say something to your mother ! Tell her to stop stepping in (nicely ofcourse since she means well)."
ebhc0h,NTA holy fuck who bullies kids what an asshole. You know what return it she has now right to do that it's part of the spirit of christmas. So yeah return it
ebhcu1,"NTA, 5 blocks? why bother with a car..."
ebhdt5,"NAH It's better for all if you if you aren't living on top of each other. You deserve your privacy and are willing to use your own money to do this. It's also a temporary arrangement, as you should be in the new house within a year.

Your parents sound like superstars, and they've raised someone thoughtful and grateful. I hope the new house build goes well.

Good luck!"
ebhhgf,"NTA

I understand that Japanese are especially racist against Koreans to the point that corporations will do background checks on potential candidates to ensure that there is no Korean blood. Your friend would have a terrible time of it and would never be accepted as anything but a foreigner. Corollary: I was a foreigner for many years. Even when you begin to identify with where you live and the people around you, they will always treat you as an outsider.

This girl has some issue that is causing her to do several things that are concerning:

1. An apparent dislike towards her heritage
2. Willingness to take on a false identity for reasons that are unclear
3. Willingness to get into shouting matches with her family over this
4. Willingness to attempt to destroy someone's life because they were honest with their feelings

In the previous thread you were DEFINITELY N-AH, in this case, very much N-TA. She worked to sabotage your life because you wouldn't support her in her delusions. Let that sink in for a moment as you prepare to move on with your life. Also, you didn't do anything here vis-a-vis manipulation.

As an aside: the dean yelling at her was abusive and poorly handled. What kind of school do you go to?"
ebhj02,NTA. It was nice enough of you to assist the family in general.
ebhkoz,"YTA. You should have rescheduled board game night. 

>I'm angry because I'm fed up of not having my time respected by my side of the family, so I've been making a point to just leave when people are late. 

This says to me you've been itching to make a point to your family about their time management, which is fair. However what makes you TA is that you put your wife in the middle of it by picking her birthday celebration to do it."
ebhqvx,NTA No one should expect someone with a newborn to travel very far and on top of that stay in a hotel. If they are that upset they can host you to help relieve the financial burden of the trip.
ebhvzz,"YTA 

OF COURSE you would be the asshole! You had NO PROBLEM with *anything* until your sister did.

AND you're an asshole for not telling your girlfriend *she might get fired because of your sister*. She needs to know IMMEDIATELY that your sister might say something or try to get her fired.

Your sister had a bad experience,  but that doesn't give her the right to make what happened to YOU about her. She needs to understand that you two are HAPPY and she is overreacting BIG TIME.

It sounds like your sister needs professional help because she is overreacting and wants to get someone fired. Just because SHE had a stalker doesn't mean your girlfriend is one."
ebhy4u,"you definitely made a mistake bringing the stray in.  you gave your family some time to bond with it.

you're not an ass for this, but naive.

i really think new family pet decisions should basically be unanimous, most of the time.  the fact that you don't want a trouble creating cat is quite reasonable, and I think you guys shouldn't keep it...

but again, since you let your family bond, you're gonna look like an ass.

NAH"
ebi2ly,"NTA

Thank you for advocating for Lara as she can’t speak for herself. 
Your brothers bf clearly plays favourites and dogs are smart enough to sense when someone doesn’t like them. 
IMO people who only want „young cute and playful “ animals don’t deserve them at all. This doesn’t only go for dogs but also for cats, horses and other furry friends. 
Your pets a friends for live not only when they are convenient for you!"

ebi6uu,"NTA - but still consider helping him with it please.

&#x200B;

 It's not about being ""right or wrong"" here... You are his life partner and he's having a problem that obviously is gnawing on him - so be a good spouse and help him with his issue.

&#x200B;

PS: Pro-tip: I have a big passion about keeping things tidy and neat, and the single best tip I can give is to organize absolutely everything with its own spot - then label every single item.... Everything has its own spot and even if it gets a bit messy cleaning it up then involves just putting every item back in its place instead of sorting out a big mess (like it sounds you have to do now).

&#x200B;

PSS: I mean label **everything**. Every single item in the entire room needs ""its own place""."
ebibfj,"NTA - “Hey, so and so. I just wanted to tell you that I didn’t know the other girls were inviting people over. I let them know this, but I felt badly after telling you no, then seeing other people at my house. Next time, I’ll make sure I tell everyone the same thing so it’s not an issue.”"
ebidgt,"YWBTA. Your friend Bob has made it clear that he and John have some unresolved issues, such that he’s threatening to leave the group if John is invited. While I understand your desire to want to understand why Bob has an issue with John, I’m not really sure why you’re willing to ignore his feelings for someone you’ve known less than a year. Is this really a hill worth dying on? Why does John need to be in your Discord server? 

Adding John will almost certainly put a strain on your friendship with Bob, if not outright end it. Whether you value that friendship is ultimately up to you."
ebieiw,NTA- And the cure for that is a glitter bomb. It’s rude to open people’s packages.
ebieqk,"That age gap. Yikes. There are more issues here than you’re aware of. YWBTA, but your husband is a creep."
ebij5k,"YWBTA but I suspect your answers are going to stratify by age. I’m older, and if it were me, I’d probably just laugh and feel bad for her. I’ve gotten to the point in my life where I know that if I need to worry about my man leaving, he can git gone. I’m not gonna stress. Love means choosing your person every single day, and if one day he does not choose me, being jealous wont change that. That being said, I did not have this knowledge at your age, and would have gone full “hold my earrings ima cut this ho.” FWIW I’m much more serene now."
ebiw1g,"NTA - but you can help her be responsible here.

Find out when she gets her paycheck (day of month) and how much it is.

Have her agree to pay you X amount on that date each month. $30? $60? Something that feels reasonable to both of you.

She's 19 and wants to have fun, so while she is TA, it's not hugely asshole-ish, particularly given that you have spoiled her a bit by your own admission.

Also - stop spoiling her or paying for anything until she makes these payments. And if she misses one, then no more fun stuff until she catches up."
ebiynu,"NTA and he sounds like a jerk, but why wait for him to start talking? Just don't be alone in a room with him, and then you can't be called rude for leaving while he's mid-sentence."
ebj0px,"NTA. 

You already thanked her in private. She needs to step down from her high-horse and get over it. It was mutually beneficial."
ebj6e5,"NTA - 21 people is a TON. Some people don't have the money to do it and I think you're showing a lot of consideration by still buying gifts for everyone and giving them all at once. If you're feeling snarky, ask MIL if she'd prefer you return what you've gotten and get all 21 people a gift from the dollar store instead so they can be ""on time""."
ebj6tf,[deleted]
ebj81i,"NTA

 A grown woman can handle being without an adult child for a birthday. And your dad is out of line too. She’s  been complaining about you & he wants you to comply to make his life easier"
ebj8xw,"NAH, she wants to show how much she is proud of you and you love that but don’t want her to destroy herself just so you can have a little fun. Just have a 1 on 1 with her and tell her that you don’t want her to push herself to do all this and that you really do feel good about her plans. Be upfront but not to the point that it comes off that your wife’s planning is dogshit."
ebja5c,"Your NAH for spending your money on what you like to do. If your spouse is feeling left out consider inviting them to buy their own plane ticket to accompany you next time, plus it would probably be more fun with someone else anyway."
ebjcyh,NTA. It takes a serious miscalculation by both adults to think that kind of uneven gift giving is okay. I think after you cool off you should sit down with your dad and explain how hurt you were by the disparity.
ebjept,"NTA

Copyright should be taken seriously, especially in an academic setting where taking credit for someone else's work is a big no-no.

If this guy does not credit your work, you absolutely should take it up with your university's ethics review panel."
ebjkzf,NTA you had the light and right of way. That guy was being an AH.
ebjozg,"NTA. Your children are your top priority and his 7 month old infant should be his TOP priority. If he’s sick and can’t be /shouldn’t be around your young children then someone needs to take off work. You didn’t make this baby so he’s not your responsibility but if your kids get sick it will be.

Plus, you’ve already said no and backing down will increase your likelihood of being guilted into the same situation in the future."
ebjs3i,"Parents nagging their kids about keeping warm/making sure they're dressed suitably for the weather is pretty standard.

There's too much other stuff going on her besides you not wearing a sweater to make a definitive judgement."
ebjt5o,"NTA - any untrained dog is a danger, a German Shepherd Especially. 

But you should also keep in mind your boyfriend is showing what kind of person he is right now. Take notice. Decide if this is what you're willing to grow old with, maybe parent with"
ebjuah,YTA.  Your feedback is fine but not the expectation they would pay the $75.  Why would they pay for that?  The kids parents should have been responsible.
ebjxlu,"NTA

Your mother is not only enabling a dysfunctional adult, she also screwed her child by breaking a promise.

There is no reason to talk to her until she is willing to apologize and make things right.

Your sibling is never going to get her act together, because your mom keeps on bailing her out."
ebk0xy,"NTA

Forgiveness in this circumstance is for yourself, it doesn't sound like he is asking for it or would appreciate it so if you don't need it then don't bother."
ebk1ce,Nta.  She is essentially a third roommate at this point.
ebk59v,[deleted]
ebk66v,"NTA - She isn’t the first person to get a floral tattoo on her leg. Flower tattoos aren’t exclusive just for your friend. If you had gotten the same type of flower, or the same design on your friend, I can understand why she might be a little annoyed. Sounds like she’s just being a little petty."
ebk6sk,"NTA.

It's unprofessional and honestly kinda creepy that men do this kind of thing tbh"
ebk967,Im gonna go with NTA. You already made these plans and booked everything. She shouldn’t expect you to cancel and drop everything for her.
ebkbl7,"NAH. I have some family members that panic as hard as your mom during travel. You are not obligated to panic with them, but they can’t help it so there’s no reason to get angry at them for it. Just let it be and move on.

The weird part is that you have other family members piling on you. I don’t get that. Is she just so overbearing that she’s intimidated everyone into helping her get her way? Or were you more rude at the station than you let on?"
ebkbnj,"NTA. It's his home as well, so he can have guests over at a reasonable time and rate, but it's not a goddamn AirBnB. If people are over so damn often and sleeping over, they should pay rent."
ebkctj,"I understand this is probably overwhelming, and a lot of change all at once. But you will never have this kind opportunity again. People pay hundreds to thousands of dollars for a nutritionist, a gym membership and someone to keep them accountable. 

Try to work with your father. If you are serious about getting healthier and living your best life, take this and run with it! Now is the best time to start. 
And the absolute best of luck to you ❤️"
ebkdqz,"NTA.  Ultimately, this baby is your cousin’s responsibility, not yours.  You provided help to the extent you were able.  Don’t let anyone guilt you into managing their problems for them."
ebkinn,"I mean. . .I certainly would not be satisfied in a serious long-term relationship where my partner only wanted to see me on weekends. NAH because you're not an asshole for not being all that invested in your relationship, but don't be surprised if he breaks up with you."
ebkjo2,"NTA. He thinks he's fine, he knows what he's doing, all his gym buddies do it, it's not real drugs, etc. He knows he's the asshole, but he doesn't care. I've known a young guy like this. It's his body, but it's not as safe as he thinks and you don't have to deal with it. The one I know has now stopped because it's expensive, it makes his anger issues worse, and he has body dismorphia."
ebkkpl,Nta.  But I am going to say her reaction was probably not about you.  She is probably stressed and emotional and took it out on you.
ebklyj,NTA. You only highlighted what is already expected of good dog owners. Not your fault he sucks at being a dog owner.
ebkmip,"YTA but a soft one. This is a tricky one for me but you've already had her over for Thanskgiving with your folks. If your girlfriend does not want you there or is uncomfortable with the whole thing, that is her call to make. Until then, it is only fair that you join her for Christmas as you promised. If you are serious about her, you can't just ignore her family when things get dramatic."
ebkn49,"NTA

You are doing what you need to do for yourself and your sanity/comfort. There is nothing wrong with that."
ebko3r,"NTA.  In my opinion, you are under no obligation to do it.

>My mom wants me to take my grandma to the social security office tomorrow

She can take her then."
ebkqf9,"NAH. I would just explain to him what you wrote here. 

I’m sure your nephew will enjoy it. It’s a good read. :)"
ebkykh,"NTA go and both of you tell the therapist what you think and tell the therapist that is your parents who need the therapy, maybe the therapist will take your side in this. You might be surprised."
ebl41n,">last year I bought the card and the present that he gave to his sister for her birthday because he didn't organise anything in time, I'd already organised my present and card for her earlier

ESH. He is TA for obvious reasons. But why are you taking this upon yourself? If you already got her a present from you, you’ve done your part. If he failed to get her a present from him, so be it. Let him fail.

Your reaction to his behavior (scrambling to make up for his forgetfulness/laziness and to protect him from the consequences) is a recipe for resentment on your part."
ebl4js,"Your friend is an idiot and needs to learn to take responsibility for his actions. There is a simple solution when you don't want people do know you did something: don't do that thing in the first place.

NTA"
ebl6mt,"YTA. I know your intentions were fine, but having music playing in a quiet area would turn a lot of people away from studying there. It's not like they know you'll turn it off."
ebl9om,"NTA, but the easiest thing would have been to say ""All the kids can sleep here and here, that leaves a double bed in son's room, one in the guest room, and the double sofa bed in the office--you guys decide who's where"". There is zero obligation to give up your bed when you are going through all the stress of hosting."
ebla87,"NTA, management can decide on whether grandkids etc aren't allowed, not the employees.."
ebla98,NAH but is it her being herself or could it be the beginnings of dementia? Something to consider.
eblb9s,NTA. You guys missed out on having a wedding to do something for someone else. People do vow renewals all the time! You guys didn't even have a traditional wedding to begin with! Your parents are being unreasonable. Perhaps they are worried they will need to pay.
eblcr7,"YTA

You knew she was running late already, and turned this into a *thing* when it really didn't need to be. It IS weird to ask her to leave the toenail clippers on the curb, I don't know how that even occurred to you as a thing that one might do. It is not going to kill you to wait until a little later to clip your toenails. If this kind of thing is frequent, her reaction was probably more extreme because she's annoyed and frustrated that you seem impervious to the fact that you're actively making her later for something that is the opposite of an emergency."
ebldab,"NTA. I understand that your SO doesn't want to cause drama, but he's also making life more difficult on you for no reason. (Oh, also, you're never having kids, **so he's going to have to break their hearts at some point anyway**.)  If he's not going to have the guts to tell them, I don't see any problem with you doing so.

If you simply got a comment every now and then, I would say ""no assholes here"", but the pestering (and gifts!) from your in-laws is excessive, and your SO needs to tell them to cut it out."
eblfby,"NTA. Her reaction is really over-the-top, given the context of the discussion. Of course you guys need to talk about potential future events when making these kinds of decisions, and premature death is one of those potential future events that needs discussion."
eblgiy,"NTA, however, once you move and a few weeks go by, it would be nice to check in and reiterate your offer.  Possibly they are in denial about how much you do, or their ability to stay on top of things and once its reality, they will change their minds.  If not, at least you tried."
eblhbr,"NTA you told her no and she did it anyway. People don’t really care though - you can explain to them that you’re there for your brothers comfort. Maturity is a thing, you know?"
eblkir,ESH- if your finances aren’t secure enough to have $200 to swing around why are you spending this kind of money on a wedding?  You are putting the cart before the horse.
eblkxq,Yta for doing it without telling your boyfriend.    I’m assuming everything was platonic.   But if you walked in on your BF and he was in a bed with another girl(pretend he has a best girlfriend).  You would be upset

ebm155,"Oh god no, NTA.  


Nobody in their right mind could call you an asshole for not wanting to bring a 15 year old high school on-again-off-again girlfriend on a family vacation.    


That's a big liability and frankly just kind of odd.  They are kids.  Maybe the request could be taken seriously for a couple of seniors who have been dating for a year or so . . . but . . . not a 15 and 16 year old in a month-long mess of a ""relationship.""    


Your family probably doesn't need that kind of responsibility."
ebm1qj,"NTA. 

As a person who grew up between divorced family and now has a SO, splitting time is part of the gig.

This is an expensive event in a formal setting. It is absolutely reasonable to not want a toddler at the table. Not all events are child-friendly, and this is one of them.

Stop with the “tell them about the venue” stuff. Tell them to get a babysitter."
ebnkqe,"NTA. 

Mental instability is contagious. (Not like physically; but someone else’s instability has a
ripple effect through families and friend groups.) 

I know bipolar quite well. And you need to view it from her perspective. The steps she takes make sense in her head, and she does what she can to stay alive. Her decisions feel like life or death to her. 

That being said; you don’t have to get sucked into the endless void that is her mental disability. It’s not your responsibility. Definitely offer help; but on your terms. Don’t over extend yourself because there’s a fine line between helping and enabling someone. If she’s genuinely interested in getting help, then help though"
ebnlej,NTA. Sounds like some bad friends tbh.
ebnlu7,"YTA. You're not the arbiter of how people should and should not handle their mental health issues.

On another note, this sub never fails to remind me how exhausting and stupid kids are."
ebnmb8,NTA. Your parents sound completely unstable
ebnops,NTA - Given the information available to you at the time you did the right thing by looking out for your students. If the mother is THAT concerned about her son's religion then she needs to communicate that. Its off-putting that you were actually given a warning.
ebnpus,"""His partner got tested before and after"" but he hasn't gotten tested himself (too scared? Has he seen Dudes results or was just told?) and wants to donate blood? NTA"
ebnq0s,"YTA. I can’t emphasize enough that someone gets to decide the dress code for their wedding. It’s their day to celebrate and you’re meant to be a part of that.
$200 for a plane ticket and $150 for a rented tux is much less than many people I know (and myself included) have spent to attend weddings.

Let’s say you don’t even get her a gift, you did mention $350 is an amount you can afford. You can probably afford to miss one month of savings."
ebnssk,"Girl. GIRL.

Dump this man. He's taking advantage of you, and you're so young. No reason to waste such a badass work ethic on someone who clearly doesn't see how lucky they are."
ebnu15,This is honestly really funny. NTA
ebnwpg,"Nah - name your kid whatever you want. 

HOWEVER it's kind of unfair to blame your father entirely for him getting angry and swearing when you say your family intentionally push his buttons. He should try to control himself but your family are equally shitty for that if they know that's the outcome and they still antagonise him in front of your kid"
ebnzza,NTA. She legit said that you are an adult and can choose whatever
ebo19o,"YTA. Seriously? You need reddit to tell you this? Regardless of who gave you the car or how much you wanna drive your buddies to school, be a good brother and drive your sister to school. You can always drive your friends around on weekends."
ebo35l,"NTA - in fact, report him to whatever labor board you can, if available. You are owed the money, and even if you broke it, it was an accident and I don't know that employers can ""charge"" you for accidental breakages. They can fire you, but in any case, you deserve to be paid.

Save the text messages, report him. Plus, if he was not paying appropriate taxes, report him for that as well. Sucks to be in his position, but he is being a total dick.

EDIT: It really depends by state, but even federally, they are not allowed to deduct anything from your wage unless you agree to it in writing. Some states (CA, IL, MA, have not checked others) don't allow for the charging for the accidental damage to employer equipment / property unless there was gross negligence."
ebo4f5,NTA. Don't ruin your friend's wedding. I think your decision shows maturity on your part. Why even put yourself in a situation you know you will hate?
ebo5c5,"NTA

Unpopular opinion but if you are on the companies dime then you should be following their rules. Smoking pot and going through such an elaborate setup on free time is fine, but during work hours is ridiculous.

Start looking for a new job OP cause your SM will probably no longer trust you after this."
ebo6w2,ESH. You’re a grown adult. You could’ve just told her you had a problem with her copying your tattoo.
ebo99j, NTA - religion is no excuse for being a bigot even though it's often attempted. Also is it even legal for them to kick you out? That's fucked up and I'd find new housing anyway to get away from the religious nutjobs.
ebo9ps,"NAH, but you are fooling yourself when you say ""gave him another chance"".  He broke up with you and has given you no indication that he wants another chance.  He hasn't called you.  He hasn't texted you.  It's over.  Accept this and do the work on yourself that you were thinking of doing."
eboa7x,"YTA - You shouldn't have your phone out in a locker room, sauna, etc. Most clubs will ban you for that shit I don't blame him for being pissed off."
eboa8l,NAH since we have no idea if Grandma will react in any way negatively.  You have a right to spend your time how you choose.
ebocy2,YTA and honestly I find your response extremely concerning. There was absolutely no reason for you to react with the amount of anger you did. I mean seriously dude you threw a hissy fit? Grow up. It’s a Christmas present and she wants to give it to you on Christmas. You can wait a week. The silver lining is you showed her what a temperamental man child you are before you have tied the knot.
ebod3x,If you get this upset over your mom buying you Christmas gifts I hate to see how you would handle a job
ebodbj,Plot twist: *they* are the serial killers which is why they are defensive and offended by this joke
ebodxx,"NTA. You guys seem to view dog’s roles differently, and because of that you didn’t realize that this was likely an earth shattering event in her life. That’s fine. You tried to make up for it, and she won’t accept that. That’s on her."
eboefu,"NTA

If he can find a better deal then he can take it. Which is the benefit of not being on a lease. It sounds like he’s paying less and has the worse room, which is fair. You’re the one taking the risk and loosing out when there’s a vacant room, so you pay less some months as well. Notice how when someone moved out he didn’t think he should pay a bigger share."
eboetr,"NAH. I would say you would be the antagonist, but at least you acknowledged the fact that she gave you a gift. imo talk to her first and maybe explain your situation but yeah, I would upgrade it. She got what you wanted, but not specifically what she wanted. But she gave you a gift, and it's really nice of her."
ebogip,"NTA, but you probably shouldn’t advertise the Brony thing. It will only make people think less of you. That said, you wouldn’t really expect a little girl to react negatively to liking her favorite show, kind of strange."
ebognj,"As I am quickly seeing, I am the asshole in this situation. This subreddit is actually quite helpful for these situations, and I appreciate all the answers I get. I'll apologize to both friends and give them each their respective money based on the effort they made. I am quite inexperienced with money and finance. Downvote if you want, I'm sorry though.

EDIT: I have paid both of my friends $5 as that seemed the most fair, and they accepted my apology."
ebohss,NAH. You're working hard and adulting well. I'm sure your family only say that because they miss you; I don't think you should change completely but you could make more of an effort to spend a bit more time with them - I'm sure it would go a long way
ebok0m,YTA there doesn’t have to be a dry party. He has to either control himself around the alcohol or decide to not go. He can do something else special with your fiancé that’s more one-on-one if he feels left out!
ebom7m,NTA. Your boyfriend needs to take care of this himself. You shouldn’t have to message *his* friend to make this right.
ebomr0,"You know it was about her. She knows it was about her.

And you both know YTA"
ebomvw,"NTA. You did nothing wrong. You even told her earlier that you were interested in her cousin, and in any case your friend does not get a veto on you dating her cousin."
eboo8d,"NTA. This isn’t just about putting you and your sister first - if the dog was relatively healthy and you wanted to put it down to benefit from the money saved, it’d be a totally different situation (one in which you’re definitely the asshole) but this dog is suffering."
ebooo4,"NTA, it isn’t your fault your employer refuses to hire the necessary staff, and it damn sure isn’t your responsibility to ensure those shifts are covered. You probably shouldn’t have lied about it, but I kind of get it because they make you feel bad, harass you with calls or texts to come in, and guilt trip you about ‘how busy it is’. My work tries the same with me. Honestly you don’t owe any employer shit as to why you refuse to work over your normal hours or FTE. Sounds like a shit show of a job anyway."
eboqdo,"NTA.  She wants the ex to move into your house with her?  Hell no.  It's your house.  If you don't want him to live there or even visit there, tell her nope.  If the relationship lasts you can reconsider."
eboqee,"NTA.  Does the parent coming for a visit know about the ex's family party?  If so, is it possible the parent coming to visit is knowingly causing a problem for you?"
ebottq,"NTA - at all! Your new gf is being an ass. She has no right to tell you who you should and should not talk to. If she does this now, imagine how much more controlling she is going to get the longer you are together.  Talk to whoever you want in life! You are way too young to be having to abide by someone else. You are barely an adult - enjoy yourself."
ebp01w,"NTA, never stop on the road for ANY reason. If you think someone is in trouble call the police. Don’t put yourself in danger."
ebp0np,"NTA. He's 8. A timer seems like a good teaching tool. Better than yelling at him, anyway. 

I'd recommend a timer that gives a 1min warning though, so he knows when it's time to rinse off and finish up."
ebp159,"Being alone is better than being with people like that.

You don't HAVE to be alone.  Do some ""feel good"" thing for yourself and others.  Volunteer at a shelter, serve dinner at the mission, do ANYTHING but degrade yourself by going to your boyfriend's family's house.

The fact that your boyfriend puts you through this time and time again says a lot about him, and none of it is good.  I don't even know you yet I know for a FACT that you can do better."
ebp1ry,"NTA

First of all Sorry about your mom. However she shouldn't be taking money from her children without paying them back. Does she have a job/make any of her own money? The economy in most countries is tough at the moment and it's hard to make enough money to live especially for parents but that's not an excuse.

You should absolutely follow your dreams and take the job, you may never get such an opportunity again. We are all living on borrowed time and need to make the most of it. Is it unfair on your brother's? Yeah sure it is but it's out of your control and you can still help out by sending money If that's what you choose to do."
ebp41c,"NTA. Your SO saying they won’t tell you what to do with your body is laughingly disingenuous, since their reaction is clearly causing a lot of tension.  You should be allowed to be you, to feel like the best version of you, and I would think your SO would want that too."
ebp44d,"YTA.  The payment is reimbursement, not a fee for the unrequested service of finding a lower price.  Unless your flatmates are aware of the discount and you know that they're fine paying full-price anyway, you're not acting in an honest manner.  To put things another way, if everything you're doing is fair, you should have no problem telling them, which you clearly have not done."
ebp5c5,"NTA


As harsh as it may sound you simply told her what she needs to hear. Sounds like she hasn't heard the word no very often."
ebp6v9,"As someone quite a bit older who doesn't drive because I was too scared when I was younger... try to bite the bullet and at least learn.  You will 100% regret it when you're older and that anxiety has set itself in concrete.  You will have friends and family that are tired of constantly having to transport you places.  You will miss out on a lot of independence unless you live in a place with good or decent public transport.

Please.  Just try.  You don't ever have to use your license but at least you will have it."
ebpang,"NAH.  She's rude, but not necessarily an asshole.  You don't sound awful for not being able to provide therapy for her.  Even if you are a therapist, you are not *her* therapist.  It's kind of you to think to send her an email rather than ghosting.  You could let her know that while you've enjoyed being pen pals, the commitment no longer fits into your life and you wish her luck."
ebpe1k,"NTA to the absolute maximum degree. Sounds like they really didn't care about something you put time into, and chose to take up an assholes time instead. I wokld totally play your campaign. 

I have a Ranger ready ❤️"
ebpe92,"YTA. Your friend made a very specific request and you are doing exactly the opposite. If he wanted you to have it, he would have said so."
ebphgp,"NTA. It's just luck, and he got his money back from you. This is helping a friend out, not the stock market."
ebphgr,"NTA. Your gf sounds like she has some maturing to do. Trust me, you’ve done nothing wrong in this situation. Maybe try a gentle caring approach, like asking her if something is wrong to see maybe if there’s a reason she’s acting this way."
ebpkz2,"NTA, it's a work trip, not like you won a free cruise or anything."
ebplkn,"YTA. First of don’t call it archaic culture standards cause it’s not archaic. If you love this girl and want to marry her then suck it up, meet her family call them auntie/uncle and bow to her parents. If you can’t do that then you don’t respect her family or her family’s cultural background."
ebplq2,"NTA. Your parents are for not teaching her and enabling her. And her for ruin your shit again and again.

Can you buy something with a lock?"
ebplz5,NTA. Your father shouldn’t have told you he’d waive your bills unless he planned to see it through.
ebpvil,"NTA and your husband needs to stop giving them information. Don’t tell them when your baby is born, if they show up don’t let them in the house. They’ve abused their privilege of knowing. And if your husband doesn’t back you up and defend you, you have bigger problems"
ebpwho,"NTA - working in healthcare means you need to behave to a certain standard. you can't just go around saying and doing whatever you please, *especially* at work, it's super unprofessional. good on you for sticking up for what you believe in, as well as giving them the opportunity to correct their behaviour rather than just reporting them immediately."
ebpwi2,"Mom of a black belt here.... there will be a million of these ceremonies!  My daughter earned her black belt by 11.... there is a ceremony for everything.   Tell him you are super proud and you cant wait to be there for the next ceremony. Ask him to have  his mom take photos and send them right away so you can see them at work.  Have him call you right after it is over to tell you about it. 
Then makes sure you are there for the next one."
ebpwxt,"NTA, she sounds extremely annoying, ignorant and judgmental."

ebq0c9,NTA they would come after you if there were damages so why not use the same set of laws to go after them
ebq0go,"YWBTA if you didn't tell her.  This is a friend that got you the job.  Sure, she should already know that a shitty work ethic puts her job in jeopardy but you now know the higher-ups are actively seeking to replace her.  Whether she deserves to be fired or not, she deserves better than you keeping silent."
ebq0sw,Nah.  Its normal for parents to want to know and normal for people to not share until they are ready.  Make it clear that when you are serious with someone you will share and that it is not about them.
ebq3la,"NAH. I know this view will not land well in this sub, but here goes: You have the right to be frustrated with him snooping--and he has the right to monitor (at least intermittently) his 14-year-old's computer use."
ebq8fj,"NTA. This has nothing to do with race. If the planner was offended by a simple question and then ignored and avoided you the rest of the event, it won’t be long before someone calls her out on her unprofessional behavior."
ebqb1p,"NAH. I work at an assisted living facility. We are not allowed to accept gifts from residents, including money. According to my employer, it is considered elder abuse, no matter the mental state of the resident."
ebqdkv,yta - u should of at least ordered some spring rolls for her when she was coming home
ebqho1,"NTA at all. In fact, I think setting some pretty hard boundaries is a good step to approaching this issue. You obviously can’t rely on her to naturally follow social norms . 

Does your roomate have a habit of making your things ‘communal’?"
ebqkcj,NAH but you frankly sound very much like a hoarder.
ebqkd8,"NAH. The “problem” in this case is that by spending more than you’re comfortable with, you’re putting a lot of pressure on this gift. Your bf saw something he liked, mentioned it, and you got upset because you already spent so much money on a different version. So now he feels pressure to love this expensive gift you got him. Plus he only planned to spend $65 on you so he probably feels pressure to make it even. 

But you’re only trying to be nice. And it’s sweet that you’re willing to spend more money than you planned to get him what he really wanted. 

I think you should return the jersey and get him one in the price range you agreed on. At this point, the jersey that costs twice as much is not going to make him happy, which defeats the purpose of the gift."
ebqp2n,"NTA. For sure. After the turmoil that your stepdad put you through, it's justified to never want to see him again."
ebqp4o,YTA. He was just showing you something he thought was cute. You were purposefully mean when you knew he was grieving a friend. Saying he doesn’t have a family had a double meaning. Apologize.
ebqsv3,NTA - quite frankly you are handling this far better then I could. I can understanf where your was is comeing from but he should have talked to you before hand. You should have been part of the dicision makeing prosess.
ebqu54,"NTA. It’s your wedding and you chose what your bridesmaids wear. Unless you’re demanding that they walk down the aisle naked with chiquita banana lady headdress.. then she’s being a brat. 

It’s one day. She can suck up wearing a dress she doesn’t like in a color she doesn’t like."
ebqvqa,"NTA - I’m not sure what the school’s accreditation deal is, but not having the right accreditation is an extremely big deal. Some degrees are essentially worthless for this reason - do your research and use this to persuade them. Additionally, uprooting your education over and over is only going to mean squandering more and more money. No matter where you are, consistency is vital. 

If this were me, I’d come up with solid (quantitative and qualitative) evidence as to why this is a bad move, and calmly show it to them. Rather than treating that conversation like “I can’t do your plan”, show them that information like “so where do we go from here?” If you show that you’re being practical and not just trying to be a contrarian, that may help."
ebqzat,"NTA- She sounds like she’s using you and your husband. Just bc someone shares your blood doesn’t necessarily make them a safe or a nontoxic person. I recommend getting the book called BOUNDARIES by Henry Cloud, you can get it on amazon. It teaches you how to set healthy boundaries in your life and is truly life changing once you understand how healthy boundaries enrich your life."
ebr088,"NTA... he didn’t notice he was missing a whole bag of groceries when he was unpacking them? At least he should’ve thought, “huh, I thought I bought yogurt?” Or something. Ur not his mom, u did him a favor by going with him/bringing it in."

May your future be peaceful. Kia Kaha."
ebr5b1,"YTA, you having depression doesn't give you license to treat people like dirt."
ebrcq2,"NTA. You barely talk to this woman, she can’t be bothered to respond to your messages within a reasonable timeframe, so she shouldn’t expect you to. She probably unsent the message because she was embarrassed. Who cares? Doesn’t sound like you’re particularly close or this relationship matters very much to you anyways. You did nothing wrong, and if she’s mad it shouldn’t matter that much anyways. \_(•_•)_/"
ebrepl,"NTA. It's smart to save money and take care of your mental health before you go back to college, your mom and stepdad has no reason to be in such a rush when you're paying (pretty high for being to a parent) rent and otherwise are not wasting your time. Maybe just seek help about the driving thing so they can't hold that against you. Good luck"
ebreud,"NAH, I also find the idea somewhat icky just as a gut reaction, partly because of the description you give of the brother, and also because he will always be in the picture, possibly acting as if he has a claim over your son. I mean if your son has an achievement, is he going to be like “Well he gets it from me!” Type of deal? Or is he going to try to parent your kid? And third, just having my partners’ brother’s sperm inside of me feels like it would be just... really personal, I know you’re not banging him but it’s intimate in a way that you have to be 100% ok with to move forward.  

NAH because your husband isn’t an asshole for wanting this. But, ANYONE in the relationship has veto power, no one should be pressured into something they don’t want, so he could become TA depending on how he goes about arguing this."
ebrghf,">Am I the asshole for not wanting to work for $5-$10 a day in the sun for 8 hours a day only for it to be ""borrowed"" 3 days later?

You can free your self from Dad.

Up the skill set."

ebrmaf,"NTA. She needs to chill. As you've said, you've attempted multiple times to stop her to no avail. She's continued to escalate things up until your bf's birthday, at which point you've reacted pretty understandably.

In that situation, I'd have done the same thing tbh."
ebrnpl,NTA someone has to say something thing and in the long run you're doing her a favour. Who wants to go through life being (unknowingly) smelly. Yes it will cause temporary embarrassment but at the end of the day she needs to improve her hygiene. I had a friend in uni like this and it was mortifying bringing it up with her but everyone was commenting behind her back. So I think telling her was the right thing to do.
ebro18,[deleted]
ebrqph,"YTA, she’s pregnant what do you want her to do go run track and field with him? If you’re so concerned why don’t YOU make time to do something out doors with him. It sounds like she has enough on her plate without you piling on more."

ebs204,NAH. Play fighting is okay as long as everyone understands boundaries like when and how much is appropriate and when to stop.

ebs3u3,"NTA 

My guess is her lack of knowledge in what you were questioning her about caused her to be nervous about her beliefs. There's this defense mechanism religious people seem to have where it's easy to make them feel under attack/(they think devil trying to take their faith away), and they get aggressive about it.

Either she'll write it off as you needing help, find something in the Bible she's content with as an answer, or she'll think about it more later and question things (least likely).

You're not an asshole for asking questions though."

>""HE IS NEVER OUTSIDE AND HE'S ALWAYS GETTING SICK. I AM JUST TRYING TO HELP MY KID, IM SO SO SORRY FOR CARING ABOUT HIM""

Well, this is one thing you can check: Keep track. Have a notepad or an app open and write down when your brother and dad are outside. ""He's been outside 40% more than you, dad. Maybe you should go outside"" especially if HE gets sick."
ebssi8,"NTA, Sounds like you were watching them with him (for him) so you can be up to speed for the movie that you were going to watch together.

So much so that you are either leaving out massive amounts of context or this post is fake.

ebt840,YTA. If you didn't want to go then you shouldn't have gone. If your work was so important that you couldn't postponed it then you shouldn't have gone. You were jig obliged to help out you chose to help out then you chose to bitch about it later. You need to learn what being assertive looks like so you stop being an arsehole friend.
ebt8c1,"NTA: But I would not say "" I will terminate the contract if they don't"". I would mention the other things you said.

ebtj4f,"Uhhhh well ""asshole"" isn't the right word, but in the context of this sub, yeah. YTA. Couple of things possibly going on here, though hard to tell which from your post:

- Instead of talking to her you talked to her friend. This comes across as insecure and dismissive of the woman's autonomy and ability to communicate and make decisions for herself. If this woman is your girlfriend it is totally not cool to go talking to her friend about your problems in the relationship.

Overall how you have written this makes it sound like you put this woman on a pedestal and dehumanise her to the point where she is some perfect object and you, the lowly man, must strive to make her life perfect. Dude. She's a person. You're a person. Have some self respect and introspection here, and think about how you would want to be treated in a relationship or friendship. Then apply that to her. Relationships are meant to be partnerships."
ebtmrh,YTA why don't you talk to her about her not including you first? Don't just make a rash judgement based on hurt feelings. She's still your sister and I am sure if she's asking you to be a bridesmaid then she can definitely be sympathetic to your feelings about the situation.

Mom basically threatened us with death if she heard my bedroom door open.  We've been married almost 17 years now, I stayed with  my parents for a week back in September when our air conditioning went out.  We shared a bed, and I joked to mom that I could really use that extra space if she wanted to lay-out the old rules...

Your partner shouldn't get a say about the PS4 since it's not theirs either. I think locking your door is the only compromise. If your partner wants to leave their own items out in the common area for roommates to use, they can. But anything left in the bedroom gets locked up."

But it is her home and you made a big mess in it and left it like that for 18hrs (assuming you went to the bar at 10PM). That's an asshole thing to do the other people that live in that space, whether you live in that space or not. Clearly, you were embarrassed/upset about having other people know about your behaviour. So clearly it's a big deal to you. You're also TA for making it seem like your sister is the problem. You're behaviour was immature and you seem to not want to take responsibility for your actions."

But, I wouldn't mention that you were ""miffed"" he didn't bring it up earlier because you didn't have any set plans yet and he didn't even get engaged at that point, did you expect him to consult with you before asking her to marry his girlfriend? Just keep the conversation about how you're very happy for him and want to be there and that you also want him at your wedding and maybe choose different months to get married in, like he can get married in June/July and you can in August/September or whatever and leave it at that"

All of this “How could she do this, how could she not think to compare the temperatures of the two sections, how could she not feel how cold it was” - you’ve gotta knock off all of that shit. That’s channeling all of your frustration AT your wife. And that just makes the problem worse because now, instead of being a mistake, it’s this whole other thing where you’re judging your wife’s intelligence & decision making skills because you would never, ever make a similar mistake. And that’s fairly poisonous to a marriage."

If an office is going to have a ""secret santa"" or whatever then they need to establish some guidelines on how the game is played - who brings gifts and how much is spent on them.

If it were me, I'd simply say that going forward you won't be participating (in the giving or the receiving) and plan to go out to lunch or something.

What's worse, is that she is involving a little baby in the issue, who has absolutely nothing to do with it. It makes me angry as hell, when parents manipulate their children into disliking someone because the parents don't like that person. Especially if it's a family member who had done nothing wrong to the kid. This is really unhealthy for the child's mental health.

I can understand your Mom, she wants everyone to get along, but she has her priorities wrong. She should be making sure, that your sister behaves (and this includes no glares or passive-agressive bs), instead of forcing you to endure it. If she wants people to get along, the source of the disturbance should be dealt with, which is your sis. IMO, it should be your sis who gets booted from the get together - she can just visit at another time if she has the maturity of a bratty five year old and doesn't know how to behave like an adult. An adult, who is responsible for the life of a little baby. Smh."
ec0whw,NTA. You don't have to keep beating yourself up over this. Your mom has made it clear she really has no intention of being your mom anymore. Therefore she has no right to be a grandparent. Take care of yourself and focus on giving your baby everything they need and deserve.

Assisted care facilities can, indeed, be where you send people for their own sake because caregiver fatigue, patient aggression, and the scope of their care can be too much for a non-medically-trained person to deal with.

My stepmother and I love my father to death, but his advanced dementia was something neither of us could properly care for. He became insomnaic (he would get up, and down, and up, and down, all throughout the night, resulting in my stepmother only getting about an hour of sleep every night). He became incontinent and could not express when he needed to use the restroom, so he would shit and piss himself (the frequency of which was reduced, but not eliminated, when we learned his 'tells'). When we needed to bathe him (either in general or as a result of incontinence), he would get aggressive when we tried to remove his clothing, so showering him could sometimes take over an hour from accident to clean. He could not shave, and got upset when we tried to help him shave. Even at our urging, he brushed his teeth very inconsistently, so he developed dental disease. Amid lots of other issues, this led to caregiver fatigue and significant health issues for my stepmother (and mental problems for us both).

It is ridiculously insensitive to claim she got rid of her FIL because he was, ""A pain in the ass."" She's being insensitive to her husband's feelings for sure (e.g., ""Get over it""), but you're ignorant to claim elderly homes are just a dumping ground for people to abandon their loved ones."

You should invite him out to coffee or dinner or something.  Make it clear you want to discuss things with him so that he doesn't feel ambushed.  


Ask him why he's coming to you now after he previously said he hated you.  Ask why he would want to live with someone he hates.  


Set the ground rules as well, possibly even get it in writing.  He's an adult and you don't want to end up in court for years trying to get a squatter out of your house if things don't work out.  Tell him you can't tolerate yelling or abuse of any type, what your expectations are for housekeeping, job/school etc.

It will also teach you patience and stubbornness, which are both pretty crucial if you want to study art later on. The best professional comic artists I know are also incredible at drawing life-like scenes and figures, and their comic drawing abilities are based on a large foundation of traditional art skills.

I would strongly encourage you to get a few books out from the library on different shading techniques (cross hatching, gradients, etc because wow smudging is a bad technique tbh), pencil control, using different media, and human anatomy or perspective. Try to do a little practice from them each day while continuing your school work. Go to a life drawing class or an artelier in your city, or if not then draw from life as much as possible. Art school isn't enough to get us where we want to be, we gotta look elsewhere to build skills too.

Backstory: my SO loves giving gifts. It’s his biggest way of expressing affection. My love languages are different, but I appreciate the thought behind the gifts. 

Two Christmases ago he gave me a birdfeeder with some birdseed. He really likes watching birds out the window and I was having fun learning about them too. I hung it up but no birds ever came, for months. Then in the spring a squirrel managed to dump the birdseed out onto the ground. I took the feeder down because I didn’t want a rodent buffet out front. I wanted to put it up at my SO’s house where there are plenty of birds and plenty of room for it but he kept putting it off and the feeder ended up forgotten in the trunk of my car.

Last week a friend and I found the feeder. I offered it to her and she said sure so I took it to her house and we put it up. I don’t plan to leave it there forever, just until I move to a better place for birdwatching. I told my SO and he was furious and demanded I get it back. I told him I wasn’t giving it away forever, just lending it. He said I should always keep gifts I receive as long as I’m on good terms with the giver and that giving them away even temporarily is rude. 

So, AITA for letting my friend use the feeder I receive as a gift? I thought it was fine but I also know most people take gifts more seriously than I do.

If you can’t do the job, you don’t get paid. And you WARN them ahead of time. 

I literally delivered to a an apartment just like you described. I couldn’t find parking and when I did I had to walk like a block to the apartment and then figure out how the units were organized because it made no effing sense and then hike up three flights of stairs just to give some college chick her Macdonalds.

How about telling the family that you're your own woman, and you don't need anyone to walk you down the aisle. Do it solo, head held high and proud of yourself.

sounds like your friend's priorities are shifting. people can be the life of the party in one stage of their life and move away from that later on. that's not because someone has ""controlled"" them, it's because they've married a person who is now their number one priority.

you say you invited her places but don't mention anything about trying to genuinely get to know her. instead, you resent her because she, in essence, took your friend away from you.

this is a constant issue in friendships of a certain age. when people start getting married and settling down with families, there are friends who feel left out or like the other party is being ""forced"" to do something or like they're ""not allowed"" to hang out with them anymore. when this simply isn't the case. people's lives change, shift direction, and sometimes, if they're not at the same stage in their own romantic lives, people will resent their friend's partners. it's misdirected contempt.

Trying to control who someone can talk to is the first step in an abusive relationship.  NOTE: I'm not saying you're abusive.  However, if you were a man and you asked this, you'd have comments coming out the yingyang telling you to stop being so controlling, and wondering what other abusive techniques you were using to control your SO. 

If your BF is into you, he'll be into you.  If he's not, then you trying to force him away from someone else will only drive a wedge between you.  Showing insecurity like this isn't a way to strengthen a relationship."

I was in a similar situation. Both me and fiancé had 40 hr/week job but my job was close enough that I could come home for lunch and get home early. I spent basically my entire lunch doing basic cleaning (dishes/laundry/sweeping/take care of dogs/whatever needed to be done) and usually did a little more or started dinner before she got home. Most days after dinner we would do some maintenance stuff together like folding laundry or cleaning the fridge but not spend a whole lot of time on it.

BUT every few weeks or so on a Saturday she would flip out about how dirty the house is randomly and just start cleaning. I’d usually be in the middle of doing something like reading or playing a game so it would take me 5-10 minutes before I came to help. Then she would get all up in arms about how I don’t help her and I would ask what I can do to assist and she said “if you can’t figure it out then go away” or some shit. This usually turned into an argument where I said “I’d help if she gave me a time or some warning of when she expected to do it, and how I constantly clean so it’s incredibly rude and hurtful that she invalidates all that”. 

So I decided fuck it I’m not going to clean when she’s not home for a whole week so she can see just how much I do without her. And at the end of that week she was absolutely shocked and apologized for saying I don’t do anything and flipping out on me, and she agreed to plan times to clean with me. 

Not saying you have to go with my approach but sometimes people just get complacent and take what you do for granted, happens to the best of us. You might need to SHOW her, not tell her, how much you do and come up with a structured way to make sure she’s putting in effort too."

Your son will need to learn to allow his siblings to have their days with you & he will get his. As long as no favoritism is being experienced by any of them, your wife is definitely wrong.

I think the only way you would be AH in this situation is if you 1.) don’t ask, or 2.) ask and then get her the opposite of what she says she wants. If she wants the splurge, do not get her groceries, she probably just wants a break to relax and spend time with family and this is how she can do it."

That said, you have to focus on yourself and it is reasonable to keep toxic people out.

If your sister can't take of her pet she shouldn't have it. It's unfair to assume you will take care of her dog. I think you should ask what can be done before you report her, or maybe talk to her first."
eclrra,"NAH. You're concerned for her well-being, and she's trying to lose her worries and potentially better her future through an unfortunately very predatory business. She's probably feeling awfully low right now, the lack of money is stressful for her, she's not sure if her husband will work out, etc. 

I think it would be a good idea to talk to her, but do so from a different angle. Don't mention that her videos are weird/embarrassing, that the MLM is just going to screw her over, etc...

Go from it from an angle of asking her feelings on the MLM and how she thinks it's going. When she starts to inevitably feel a bit down about it because it's not going and likely never will go well, make some gentle suggestions. What is she good at? What are her hobbies? Does she like feeling like a self-made woman, or wants to be self-employed? Perhaps she could start a craft business (i.e Etsy)? Maybe she could take a minimum wage job or do what she previously did for a while and go to school for something she's always been passionate about, then get a job in that? Stuff like that.

The top priority is maintaining her sense of self worth, confidence, and positivity, because she likely is going through a super hard time. However, you also are helping her out financially by telling her that the MLM is 99.999% of the time a bad way to spend time/money. Avoid ""what you're doing will never work"" and instead go with ""...but what about this *other* thing, wouldn't that be fun?""."

You can try to support her and let her know how much you care, but remember that her decisions are not within your control. Try to help, but don’t blame yourself if she can’t or won’t accept it.

They're telling you not to go to a good college because they think you're not mature enough to live on your own, but one of the reasons they tell their child not to go attempt to dramatically better their life with **a full-ride scholarship** is because their kid won't be around in case of an emergency event where they suddenly *die*?

Third of all:if you're mother really wants to see you for Christmas, why doesn't she just accept your offer of you coming alone? Doesn't make any sense.

Lastly, people who guilt trip or post things on Facebook are the worse. I hope you see her methods are not okay tools to make someone do something for you. It's manipulative and passive-aggressive.

She made several (bad) decisions, as an adult. If she is upset with how things worked out she should be mad at herself, or the owner.

Have you asked them if they realize the stress they are putting you under?

Also, I would probably talk to your counselors about all this and get some feedback on how to cope, now and in the future when you leave IOP. And tell your dad that his ""having to"" pay child support has nothing to do with you and that he needs to complain to someone else. And yes, it's perfectly reasonable to ask one of them to prove who is paying your rent, since one of them is clearly lying.

Your mother is not treating your brother like an adult, but you want to. Adults make their own decisions given the information they have at the time. She is robbing him of both his time, and his effort, and the experiences, but she is mostly robbing him of his choice.

I think your compromise of Christmas Eve + morning at hers is a good plan that involves lots of family time on all sides. I understand she feels like she’s been with your fam more in recent years, but seems like Christmas night at your aunts is mandatory to avoid resentment after rsvping so far in advance. Would she want to let down her own family members if the roles were reversed?"

Not only is it unreasonable for you to ask that, it's ridiculous for you to assume that your wedding comes before the feelings of the two most important people in his life. You came into his life and expected him to drop everything he was doing to celebrate your wedding to a person he barely knows.

Cutting him off over this would be foolish. Find another groomsman and have a good time instead of worrying about whether or not your groomsman will choose you over his partner/mother."

If he expects you will be 'mother'  and suddenly make a magical christmas appear he is going to be disappointed.

If it was me I would tell him now that a gift for you is non optional. He has to take the time and trouble to go out and find something. Alternatively you can go too and choose it together but then he doesn't get a veto! Or make other plans - is it too late to get a flight home?"

It is okay to give friends unsolicited advice if you feel they are about to make a train wreck of their lives. You do it respectfully. You state your case rationally, and then you drop it.

I have one criticism of the points you made. Choosing to be a single mother is a valid choice. She does not need to be in a relationship to have a kid.

Every other point you make is dead on.

But some advice:

You have a child now, things in your life are changing. Just because you used to always work Christmas (and like doing that) doesn't mean that it HAS to stay the same.

You have a family now, and if your BF wants to be able to celebrate Christmas with his family (you and child), his feelings should be taken into consideration.

Yes, your child is still very young, but you would be missing out on your kids first Christmas and, while the day itself might not be as important to you, it's important to your BF and (likely) will be important one day to your child as well."

But don't lend her money.  Please don't.  She can't afford to repay you, which is why her interest rates are so high.

Instead, offer to pay the interest on the loans she takes out in just her name, up to a certain amount, each year.  If her program costs $50k per year, for instance, and her interest rate is 8.5%, that's about $4250 in interest the first year, $8500 the second, $12,750 the third, and $17,000 the fourth (assuming simple interest, not compound).  

Lending your sister money she may not be able to afford can cause stress in your relationship.  Instead, offer to pay $X per year directly to her lender to cover some of her interest, as a gift, free and clear.  If you could afford it.  

Sit down with your budget and decide how much you might reasonably afford from current income.  This helps reduce your sister's debt without her bring indebted to you AND limits your financial liability."

Ultimately with foster and then even adopted children, even your parents may not be grandparents, it may be some time before you get to be mum and dad.

If you adopt a baby then yeah, go ahead, have the conversation. But children 3+ are not gonna just call you mummy, or her grandma. And it’s ok to explain that to her, absolutely. But saying ‘they’ll call my dad grandad and you Sara’ is fairly naive.

As an adult I still love the idea of Santa even though I know he isn't real so chances are your son will still enjoy experiencing the Christmas magic as he grows up, he'll just know there isn't a stranger popping into the house once a year through the chimney.

The title is very misleading. 

You ended with if you were TA fir not apologizing and "" blasting"" him and, from what I can understand, this could be boiled to this:

1. He misunderstood something you said/did
2. He was rejected and feeling upset
3. Because of 1 and 2, he felt anger towards you.
4. Instead of working it out, the two of you have been at odds with eachother.
5. Because of your lack of apology and neither of you talking it out with the other, he thinks his anger is justified and still clings to it.
6. You think you're justified because you did nothing wrong.

You're both being butts. Both of your egos are too big to let this go. Never has ""blasting"" someone helped in any way. If you really wanted to salvage the friendship, you would apologize for any misunderstanding and try to work things out."

ed1z4m,"NAH- maybe you two should see the therapist together. This obviously isn’t a whim of hers if she has researched, got counseling, and debated it enough to make a decision. You have valid concerns but they don’t negate her view of herself or how she is feeling. Instead of talking, each write a letter to the other. Alternatively since your talks come across as more of a debate, let her speak and get everything out. You then do the same and save all questions for once you are both done. Listening to hear each other is key rather than listening for your turn to respond."
ed1z8q,NAH you can move out OP.  If you want them to back off and live your life then go live it.  Why are you sticking around being disrespectful to your parents and having them do the same to you. If you can’t afford a place on your own then get a roommate and move.

You said he had these plans for a while, so you can’t really be upset with him for not really wanting to cancel them. You also asked him last second to cancel his plans. I can understand wanting your partner to be there during the holidays and so that gives you a little pass to be selfish, but you can’t really be upset with him for saying no."
ed29ki,Esh. I feel like you should have told her she was kicked off. But I think you were justified in doing it. She should know that she fucked up.
ed2duh,"NTA. Y'all need to get a handle on this. Mommy and Daddy's love doesn't mean much if it's from a place of exhaustion and frustration. Love on em during the day, give em lots of snuggles and kisses and stories before bed, then THEY SLEEP IN THEIR OWN BED. PERIOD. They can come in when they have a nightmare or it's storming, but on regular nights they NEED to sleep in their own bed. For their development and YOUR sanity/relationship/physical and mental health."

ed2ghx,"NTA, it seems clear to me that she's not interested in the gift, or being friends with you. I'm SURE she has friends that she finds time for even though she's so busy with maternity leave, and you didn't make the cut. Time to move on."
ed2lk0,"Holy shit.

Let me get this straight. You moved in with him, and decided to install cameras without his permission, he got mad, you guys reconciled, YOU DID IT AGAIN, and are now trying to kick him out for it?

And you might as well end the friendship. He's better off without you."
ed2lo1,"If this story is true as presented, NTA, but you're not going to get the results you're hoping for by going this route. 

Speaking as a teacher, ""most of the class agrees"" isn't going to get through to a teacher like this, because they'll dig in their heels, convince themselves you're all brats who don't know what you're talking about, and you'll be back to square zero, if not worse off.

If you really want to pursue this, you need to put together some receipts or whatever gas payment documentation you have to back up your claim that they owe you $700. 

If the arrangement is that they will pay for your gas, you should just ask them to give you a gas card that is linked to their credit card moving forward."

You don't owe him or your mom an apology, your time, or your consideration. I hope he treats your mom better than he treated you."
ed2ycq,"NTA

Do not get him anything. You said that you see him 1-2x a week when faded, so I'm assuming you aren't hanging out, it's just for sex. You also say you dont see him sometimes for a week or two. To me, that isn't even fwb - that's fuck buddies. 

Getting a single gift is odd imo with that kind of relationship. Multiple?!?! No. He's attempting to woo you, despite your stating that you don't want a relationship. Decline his gifts and restate your boundaries or bounce."
ed2ydt,"Definitely NTA. Bar drinks are already so horribly overpriced anyway, and if he really gets that much from all of you, he can afford to do you guys a favour. Also, he shouldn't have agreed to it and then gone back on it; that's what really makes him TA. You're NTA because nothing says you can't buy alcohol elsewhere, and this guy shouldn't be relying on all of you to keep his establishment open. The only thing I might be a little iffy about is the huge cash tips. If he really is that cheap, he probably isn't paying his staff well. But he also might make their lives harder over time if they get big tips from all of you."
ed2ymq,"If he helps with about 25% of the videos, he should be paid for those videos. Does YouTube breakdown your payments per video? If not, how about giving him 12.5%? (Half revenue of 1/4 of the videos)? It's not a lot, but it would compensate him for his work.

Edited to add: NAH. You should pay him, but he started helping you without expectation of compensation."

ed30rw,Info do you live with her?
ed316r,"NAH- You laid down a boundary in a very healthy straight forward way. To me, how it’s written, it does not sound as if you were rude in tone, then politely changed the subject. You even apologized (which is kind but I don’t think necessary).

She is allowed her feelings too. Fertility is such a tough issue. And it stirred some stuff and she took your redirect personally. It happens.

Edit: changed a word."
ed34qi,NTA. I think marriage counseling should be in your immediate future so you guys can figure out where the miscommunication happened and how you're going to avoid it going forward.
ed38oi,"NTA but please consider what will happen here.  You have the word of a child speaking out about a single incident.  CPS (assuming US) is overworked and underpaid.  So likely outcome is nothing other than you being cut off from your family.

Assume there's no abuse here.  You just got cut off from your family for no reason and endangered her custody of her child.  Her ex could now sue for custody or reduced child support based on this.

Assume there's actual abuse here.  You just got cut off from your family and your little brother is left with his abusive parents.

Better outcome is if you watch wait and listen.  Get involved with your little brother and really see what's going on.  It will leave you in a better position to either report it so something gets done or feel safe in knowing there's no abuse."
ed3abt,Gotta have an adult discussion. She can't forbid shit. You're a grown ass Dr. Man. But she might have some sort of twisted traumatizing past making her hate gambling. Set a limit for how much you'll spend. Tell her you two might have different morals on this one. It's not like you're trying to defend your gambling addiction... Is it a deal breaker for her? If it is I'd want to understand why.
ed3aex,NTA you were asked directly if it annoyed you and you replied diplomatically in the affirmative. Why ask the question and then get angry?
ed3bga,"NTA

It sounds like he needs professional help, and probably an AA sponsor. It's not your responsibility to take care of him, or keep track of him. He needs a support system, but for that to help he needs to want to get better, and make an effort to do so.

ed3gks,"NTA. Your friend is TA for assuming that she has any right to an opinion on your life or the people you choose to have in it, and your brother is obviously TA for being the shit-head he is."
ed3kwy,"From the view of someone completely removed from your political issues, NTA.  However, to those around you, they probably view your lack of participation kind of like if someone crosses a picket line.  Kind of like they stood up and took the risks to protect (or get) something that you will be able to take advantage of without risking anything. 

You can choose whether or not you want to let your voice be heard by protesting, but just be aware that by not participating these around you probably feel that you dont fully support their cause."
ed3n3c,wtf NTA. Why would you be the asshole for being willing to do her a solid but being unable to? What an entitled dick she is.
ed3oii,"NAH.

I'm so sorry for your loss.  

Unfortunately, I know *exactly* what you're going through, as my dad passed the day before Easter.

Holidays often suck anyway, what with all of the forced happiness, the expectations, and all of that.  And as much as your husband's family probably loves you, I'm sure it feels like no one quite understands the pain that the holidays, particularly Christmas, brings you.

Some people may express shock or bewilderment that you're still grieving.  Or they may tell you to just get over it.  But you can't ""just get over it"".  You have to work your own way through it.  

Now here's where it gets a little tricky.  Depending on your husband's relationship with his folks, he may need to spend some time with them - either because he needs that connection, or to keep the peace.  But you can also ask him for what you need, too.  

Take care of yourself, and know that it gets better everyday.  And expect bad times and days to come out of the woodwork without warning, even several years later.  Especially at the holidays.  

Hang in there."
ed3p82,Why surround yourself with people that refuse to accept you? You're not obligated to do anything. NTA obviously.
ed3qbx,"NAH but You should probably talk to Mike about this.  

On the one hand, you shouldn't lie to your partner, that never ends well.  On the other hand, you shouldn't out someone without their consent.  So go talk to Mike and figure this out."
ed3qdz,"NTA  


I suppose there's a chance she isn't an asshole, but you shouldn't ever block someone's driveway even if only for a few minutes. I might be missing something though. Either way you were polite and courteous based on your description so you're good on the asshole meter."

ed48cx,"NAH - You have your examples, but what about the times that *you’ve* been wrong for being pessimistic? Surely, they exist. I understand your reasoning for worrying about your husband, but it’s also not a bad thing to be optimistic about a situation. I’m more pessimistic in nature because, like you said - I don’t want to get my hopes up only for them to be torn down. I’ve always considered myself a “realist.” But I would honestly love to be more optimistic about things! 

Since he calls you pessimistic, I think you both need to meet in the middle a bit more. He should realistically look at a situation for what it is, but I think you should also not try to find the bad in every situation. And I’m not saying you are, but there ARE ways to remain positive while also preparing for things to go awry. It sounds like he doesn’t prepare himself for the bad while you prepare for everything to possibly go bad."

Anyway, fuck that noise.  You might not fit HER ideal of a perfect 10, but I'm pretty sure there are plenty of people that find you attractive so there's no need for her bullshit validation to come into play at all."
ed5cc8,"NTA - it's not only disgusting, but you could leverage ""sniffling, snorting and possible allergy issues"" as a soft reminder to only bring CLEAN clothes in the future.   Maybe a joke about ""picking up gum with the clothes"" might be worked in?

Or - accept the gift and wash it before you give it to the baby.

If she pushes ""put it on him now"", then you could say something about washing it first and if she REALLY pushes, then maybe suggest that you wash it because *it smells like smoke* or somesuch."

I'd gently explain that you guys can come up with a schedule for household chores that you guys can divvy up fairly so everyone participates. And make it a good routine for him and yourself. But also take into account that actively working with the general population can be harsh and stressful at times which is draining so video games might be his way of decompressing.

So there's a music festival coming up that's sold out. The fest has a program that you can sign up for to be placed in line when a ticket becomes available. I was lucky enough to get a pretty low # spot in line, but I know that I won't be able to afford it by the time a ticket becomes available. I let a friend have my place in line by switching the name and card info. Just a couple hours later, another friend offered to pay for the ticket if I payed him a little at a time. This could be my last shot to go and I really don't want to pass it up. But I know the feeling of thinking you'll get the ticket, then having it fall through.

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and suggest that if she was offered to go back in time and have EVERY pregnancy complication known to womankind, but in the end she'd have her baby back, she'd most likely say yes, and ask for some more pain just to be sure.

Then just moved on from the incident. She did the mature thing and told you about her mistake *which she already obviously knows shouldn't have happened.*

You're being about as helpful as saying ""well don't slip"" after someone tells you they slipped on ice. Clearly their goal was to slip on ice so they need to be told that will hurt them, right?

This really depends on your relationship with them.  You aren't the asshole for buying the gifts, as you did it before they asked you not to.  And your reasoning for not saying anything yet is understandable as well.

This all boils down to how they would react if you gave them the gift, whether during Christmas or later on.  

This could all change based on your relationship, but I'd say it would be fine to give the kids gifts (I think most people would understand that you'd want to give your nephews/nieces gifts regardless) and give them their gifts later.  You're moving, are they helping you with the move (lugging shit around, etc)?  If so, you can just make those gifts ""Thank you gifts"" instead of Christmas gifts.  If that works, it's win/win.

Why do you care what he calls you? Maybe you are his best friend. That doesn't necessarily have to mean he is YOUR best friend! But maybe he doesn't have a lot of close friends and enjoys hanging out with you. It seems like maybe he isn't that good with social cues or he's not that sociable as a person. But it sounds like he genuinely likes and respects you as a person and he trusts you. Maybe he's an introvert who doesn't feel the need to talk to his close friend all the time. That's not to judge you, btw. I chat up my good friends all the time too! But not all of my friends reciprocate.

To me, it sounds like he really values you as a friend, and that HIS way of showing it might not be the same as YOUR way, which is okay! But I think you saying ""don't call me your best friend"" would be hurtful to him.

My advice- if you really are this annoyed, I would talk to him about it! ""Hey you call me your best friend but we barely talk about non-school stuff, I'd love to hang out with you more"" and see what he says.

edf03g,"NTA. You're a woman standing outside a sex shop being eyeballed by a strange man who is pacing back and forth staring at you. A lot of guys will say Y T A for being rude in how you yelled at him.  But the unfortunate reality is that guys who are already behaving in very creepy ways, who obviously can't read the room and understand when/where is an appropriate time to approach a strange woman, will probably not take a polite ""no thank you"" for an answer. Forceful and loud responses which are designed to attract the attention of potential witnesses are the *safest* response in particularly creepy situations.  As women we can be safe and we can be polite. Sometimes we can't be both at the same time though.

Edit to say thanks for the silver! It's my first one! :)"
edf09k,Yeah NTA then.... if you said yes to every opportunity to donate. You’d have nothing left for yourself. And tbh they are getting support it seems from the community... there are thousands who wouldn’t even get the support they are seeing so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

You're buying an accessory related to one of her passions. That's for her pleasure, not an expectation that it'll help her take care of you.

edfbte,"YTA - this isn't a gift or even a gag gift.

BUT, it seems like you keep using your illness as an excuse to not travel, but you are fine enough to go to Japan and explore. Also, you said a night in Tokyo was about the same as the hotel (and your parents were providing the lodging in Seoul) so money wasn't really the issue either.

It seems like you really just wanted to stay in Tokyo and used any excuse you had. Your father used his limited buddy passes to get you there, so you could have a family vacation and you chose another trip instead."

edfnhj,"NAH congrats on becoming a great person. There’s nothing wrong with her calling you dad, she clearly know you’re her bio-brother, but you’re a dad to her. Tell her only age appropriate stories, and given how you describe your parents, you may need to wait quite a few years."
edfo0x,"NTA. These people appear to be taking advantage of you.  They made this bed, they can sleep in it."
edfq6v,"NTA you’re not the asshole because nobody ever explained the situation to you to your satisfaction. No way I’m taking out a loan unless I know all of the details as to its real value in my life. You took out a loan and got nothing in return. Perhaps your loan prevented your family from financial ruin but you have no way to know that. 

Especially because some time has gone by and you are probably more adult now, I highly recommend you ask your parents for more information about their reasons for asking for the money. There are casual and not so casual ways of doing that. But if you don’t know it will eat you up. Money issues between family members should be settled ASAP, as they can truly tear families apart. 

Maybe they were trying to teach you a lesson, maybe they were trying to save the family home. Maybe they’re assholes. You won’t know unless you ask for more information."
edfqe1,No A-holes here. There were no bad intentions just some miscommunication.
edfrv4,What’s with the misleading title? Slight YTA for doing the weird door thing. Just leave it. It is up to the other person whether they want to hide until other people have left the restroom.
edfsyx,"NTA. Not only are you not an asshole you’re a victim. Your mother is stealing from you. Let your grandparents know what’s been happening and ask them to help you set up and account your mother has no access to. I’m so sorry this happened to you, that’s awful."
edfufs,YTA. You have no right to block the street for your own convenience. Pull around and try again.
edfuy3,"BTA: You are both assholes in this situation. A is being a huge asshole, and if he wanted that care package to only be to your fiancé, then he should of stated that before, not after receiving it. He also shouldn’t of been so crude about the dice getting taken away. There is no excuse for shitty behaviour. Only A is responsible for his behaviour, not his wife. 

You’re an asshole for keeping your feelings in and not being vocal with your fiancé about the problems with A until you snapped. Your fiancé did not deserve that, especially when he wasn’t the problem. Keeping your feelings in and letting it build up will never turn out well, which is exactly what happened. Maybe a group chat about A with everyone (calm) and laying all your cards on the table about the problems everyone has with him will be best. See if everyone agrees and then it will be a group decision to keep him out / bring him back. 

Seeing how there are multiple people in your D&D group, regardless of who created it, the group should solve the issues as a team, not one or two people calling the shots. That just alienates the rest of the group."
edfvcx,"Soft YTA... I don't think you're actually an asshole but that dog is not going to understand why she is relegated to the floor while her buddy gets to stay with you. That would hurt my heart if I were you, or the boyfriend, in this scenario.

edfwnh,"NAH  

Comparing the achievements of relatives is kind of an asshole thing to do if it's meant to make someone feel degraded, but possibly they don't mean it that way. Given that you call it an immigrant family, I don't know the cultural/social norms for you. Sounds like you need a big conversation with your parents and see if they respect your wishes."
edfxxv,"NAH. But start with a conversation, offering to help and donate your tank.
If they like the fish, I'm sure they will appreciate some expert help keeping it heathy and happy."
edg0nf,"NAH

I think your issue concerning C is that maybe you're a little insecure in yourself or standoffish to people who you feel like are too nice. 

If the tone of her voice didnt feel passive aggressive, she probably just genuinely meant what she said. If you stumbled your words, you probably looked nervous & maybe she didnt want to make a big deal about it.

I dont know C & I only have your post to go off of, but you are coming across as quite shy, there is a chance she talks to you the way she does because of how you act around her. 

Either way, neither of you seem like assholes."
edg1l8,NTA. It's nice of your to get them something at all. I suggest putting that money into a trust or savings account for them. Do it each year and when they're old enough they should have a sizable amount. This is what my Aunts and Uncles did for me and it was amazing when I bought my first house.
edg3s4,NTA. Who gets upset that they can’t give someone a gift? I’m the same way because I’m terrible at thinking of thoughtful gifts. Maybe y’all can do an activity together instead of a gift exchange.
edg49w,"YTA. The proposal happened. In all its imperfect glory!  You've got a baby on the way, so it's time to get used to things not going as planned.  Ask for another sweet speech on your anniversary, perhaps, but you don't get a ""re-do"".  (And yes, you will laugh someday.) Congrats!"

edg56w,"NTA, you made plans that were originally between you and one other person. You then invited others to join you, at your already set plans. He knew that and should have simply declined if he didn’t want to join you, instead of trying to change your plans."
edg7v9,"NTA NTA NTA. Good HEAVENS. Even if it weren't for the prozac and the suicide, you would be absolutely right to be concerned about this. Getting drunk every night is Not normal and it is Not healthy and he is on the road to alcoholism if he isn't there already. Combined with being on a medication that doesn't mix with alcohol it's incredibly dangerous, and combined with what happened to your brother it's ALSO incredibly disrespectful of your feelings and downright horrifying behavior. You are NOT the asshole and you are NOT overly controlling. You are *worried about your husband's safety*."
edgebd,"NTA. This is part of adult kids growing up and taking on family responsibilities of their own (and your serious partner is your family as far as I’m concerned, especially if you live together). It’s also life happening; home ownership comes with these curveballs, and they’re rarely conveniently timed.

It’s hard for your mom, but while I understand this is new and an adjustment, she really needs to step back and let you work this out. I don’t think she’s a huge asshole or anything, but she is the one who needs to be understanding here."
edgekq,"NTA

Your brother is. You've already offered money so unless your mom just plain wants to be living alone, you aren't doing anything wrong.

That being said, your mom may have a point in how an established routine, like getting a job may help. I've never been in the position but it doesn't sound so farfetched to me and maybe other struggling alcoholics or life counselors would feel the same way."
edgf52,"Definitely NTA. They shouldnt force you to go if you dont believe in Christianity.

It sounds like they are manipulating you and i would even say your mum would be slightly TA for not respecting your choices. I would suggest maybe finding another activity you could do with them."
edgg2m,"NTA

Theres pranking and then there's bullying. They took it too far. While they are young and can get carried away they are definitely old enough to know right from wrong.

Poor jack, this type of thing could actually leave a deep scar. I've been ""pranked"" like this (when I was 10, by strangers who were about 14 or 15), it has very deeply affected my trust and self image.

Jack may be struggling with security issues, humiliation, trust of family, amongst other things. Your sisters need to step up and take responsibility, apologize, and take a while to really think about their behavior and the repercussions to those around them."
edgh58,"NTA I would have expected... not demanded.... but expected, a friend to take me around to show me the sights, favorite eateries, and spend some one on one time with me catching up. A meal or two with her friends so I could me those important to her would be understandable and enjoyable. But not the whole visit."
edgik1,"YTA, yikes. Let the girl get laid"
edgj3x,"YTA, opening the oven door can absolutely affect the way some things cook, particularly pastries and baked goods. You may be a chef, but you seem like you know nothing about baking. You should apologize to your sister."
edgjs7,"YTA for having obscene decorations in the first place. 

You described them as R rated. That’s not mildly obscene.

Edit: i also live in a gigantic house, with no kids, with my military husband. None of my neighbors have any idea of our future family plans, or lack there of."
edgl59,"YTA. Why on earth are you insisting on a 5k ring when she doesn't care about the price? She cares about getting engaged and married, but you've put up an arbitrary, unnecessary price tag on it as a barrier. The only reasons I can think of for that are a. you are weirdly invested in showing off wealth through her ring or b. you aren't actually sure about marriage and are stalling. 

It's incredibly gross that you're calling it ""dragging your boyfriend down the aisle"". Marriage has a wide range of personal and cultural meanings that vary for different people. Why do you care about what you think your girlfriend 'deserves' and not what is actually important to her?

Edit in response to your edit: lol amazing that after the overwhelming YTA response here you decided that clearly she just needed to be ‘reasoned’ with."
edgmas,NTA - Why would you be an asshole for this? Your belongings were ruined because of the kid.
edgnpj,NTA. She doesn’t own her friends. They can hang out with whoever they want.
edgnxc,NAH- Based on your moms previous behaviors I can see why you didn’t. Your mom probably just wants to know she’s still important and to get an invite even if she can’t come.  Sounds like you guys have a complicated history ( and from personal experience) keep sending the invites even if you know she probably won’t come. Keeping cordial communication can help prevent misunderstandings and non intentional hurt feelings in the future that could drive further wedges in your already complicated relationship.
edgq0f,"ESH

I mean, she’s 9. Instead of threatening her to do well, you could encourage and help her study, like a parent.

But she also cheated and thought it better to waste her time coming up with a method to cheat instead of simply doing her work or studying."
edgqia,"NTA, you told her personal stuff and she spread it around at work for no reason? That would cut anyone out of your life but unfortunately she is still there solely because she is your girlfriends best friend. Have you tried telling your girlfriend you don't mind them two being friends but just don't ask to try to force friendship between you two because of these things?"
edgr68,"NTA: the last place was his, only he was on the lease, he got the whole deposit back from that place. You started fresh at the new place as 50/50 roommates - if gets your half the security deposit you should get out of paying your half of the rent after you leave. Also if you're both on the lease then you're each entitled to 50% of the security deposit when you split it initially. You're living up to your half of the 50% bargain, he should too. Also also, you should make the point that he ended up no worse off, because had the old roommate been there, he'd have been in the same position. He's trying to punish you for the relationship ending, and that makes him the real asshole here."
edgrpt,"NTA. You're never obligated to give a gift to someone and if there was an expectation that you would, it should have been communicated to you especially since you hadn't exchanged gifts for them in the past.

if you apologize for anything, it would only be for the confusion and not knowing gifts were happening this year when they hadn't before. But I would just leave it at that."
edgxq9,"NAH. Asking is fine and I would totally understand why you would want him there. But what purpose would it serve if he tried to call in and ended up getting written up or fired? I can understand why he isn't necessarily in a position where it's just as easy as calling in sick.

That being said I hope he's at least coming to stay with you for a bit after he's off work. 

My sister in law has all those same conditions and it's so hard. Wishing you a speedy recovery. <3"

You can be free. Best of luck meeting your father."

edhhs7,"YTA. Not for declining, but for the way you declined. You could easily have had a one-on-one conversation with your step-brother about how you were worried about the cost and gracefully bowed out. It sounds like the way you did it was really tacky and embarrassing. Maybe he considered you closer to him than you considered him. Or maybe this was an effort to become closer with you. Either way, it’s quite common to spend a lot of money as part of the bridal party and you could’ve politely declined when initially asked."

It's not like he has to listen to them. 

IIWY, I'd tell him that it's not just his car and that you're allowed to have radio stations of your own, and to stop deleting them.

I have had family and loved ones who are schizophrenic or schizoaffective. It's hard to walk the line between ""you are sick and I'll help you"", ""you are sick and I need to be tough on you"", and ""you are sick and affecting me"".

In this case I find your mom is TA the most. There's a difference between helping your child by being patient and understanding their decision but if they are actively hurting themselves you need to step in."

You don’t know why, or what happened, or where she is. And then she walks in holding blatant proof that she has been hanging out with the dude who has been trying to one up you in front of her. Most guys would be PISSED, but when a man does it his wife is degraded to a hormonal basket case. She didn’t know where you had been, you didn’t take one minute to even send her a text letting her know not to wait around. Then you walk in holding a plate of food from your buddies girl friend, who probably knew it would bother your wife. Enjoy the couch."

That will remind her, your parents, and everyone in the room that you already did something for her for Christmas, and you're also giving her something on the actual day. 

Sometimes it's more about symbolism and the gesture than it is about who's right. While I am fully on your side, I'd advise thinking about your sister and forgetting about your mom. $5 or so isn't going to matter in a few weeks, but the gesture might mean something to her."

If meeting beforehand makes all the difference, then why not go up a day early, or Skype?

It's pretty dickish to uninvite someone. This is your friend's wedding, so it's his decision. His decision is shitty.

Not really an asshole but I strongly recommend you get someone to confide in about this whether it’s a professional or close family or friend.

The value of the gift doesn’t matter. It sounds like you got your sister something that she’ll really enjoy, and something you chose with care. That is worth more than anything.

I make 7x easily what my brother does. Last year I got him a Switch and a few games, because I knew he was saving for one and he could put that money toward his student loans, etc.. I spent a few hundred dollars on something he really loves. He bought me a beautiful journal and a Harry Potter Funko POP to take with me on a road trip. I love Harry Potter and I love writing; I had a blast taking pictures of tiny Harry at a bunch of national parks. He probably spent 1/10th of what I did but what matters is that he took the time to pick out something that was so thoughtful and showed that he just gets me.

TL;DR? You got your sister an awesome, thoughtful gift. The money doesn’t matter."
edpzv6,"YTA, sounds like you had made prior plans with them that now was canceled last minute."
edq0ra,"I kind of want to say YWBTA if you explicitly say your group doesn't like him. My suggestion would be to just use the new group chat and fade out of that one.

Then again, everyone on the internet says things would be solved with proper communication. I don't find this a big issue, though. You want to talk to your active friends freely, so another group chat makes sense."

Jealousy changes nothing, it’s not cute, and insecurity is extremely annoying to me. Think about it, if you decide to cheat, your SO yelling at you isn’t going to stop you. In my mind, when one person decides that something besides their partner is more interesting, it’s over anyway. So we may as well enjoy our relationships until the day we don’t. Jealousy won’t make anyone stay."
edqhop,"NTA - I really hate it when people show up at my work two minutes before we close the office and expect me to stay 15 or 20 minutes late because they were technically there before we closed, so I'm somehow obligated to deal with their issue. This happens quite often and the entitlement that they think they deserve special treatment and I must be heartless because they are already there and I won't just leave late so I'm inconveniencing them... no. I just want to be done work when I am supposed to be. Sometimes people stroll in 2 minutes after we are closed before we've walked out and locked up and my co-workers and I all have our coats on, and will still throw a hissy fit."
edqicn,"NTA. I wouldn’t want to be around anyone after I just gave birth. And as you mentioned, newborns are extremely sensitive. You didn’t tell them never, you gave them a date a month later than what they wanted and I think that is extremely fair. But I’m not respecting that is crossing a boundary"
edqisq,"NTA

Fuck that. 5 bucks?! Sorry, that’s not normal. That’s $2.50 per person as a wedding gift."
edqlks,"NTA

If I could hug you, I would. 

I don't think you're the asshole for saying he can't stay with you anymore. I think a moratorium on extended visits in the near future is warranted. I do hope you welcome him again when the holidays are over and life is a bit less pressured from all sides, although with a new baby that could be a while. 

Also, I would privately explain how the last 24 hours have been to your grandparents because they owe you an apology"
edqllf,">He told his father, who told MIL and now she's barrading me with texts saying I'm ungrateful and everything.

NTA, and not even your MIL, but your husband is. Why did he feel the need to go out of his way to start drama between you and your MIL?"
edqlpe,"NTA, but you're going to have to pay the ticket and then never let this person borrow your car. The fight isn't worth $20."
edqntq,"NTA, it’s your job as parents to protect your children from toxic people. Your in-laws will only treat your children well until they upset/defy them on some way, then they’ll treat the LO’s the same as they treat you."
edqpgn,NTA You asked your mom to take care of your dog and she did not. Now you know that you cannot leave your dog with your mom anymore.
edqpog,NAH I understand he doesn't mean to. My SO cuddles me in his sleep to which I'll just shift a bit and he lets go. I also understand your frustration. You're trying to get sleep and the constant coughing doesn't help. It's a nightmare.
edqqqx,"NTA the brother should adjust to the general schedule of the house, he is crashing for 2 weeks in a small apartment without a guest bedroom!! You dont need to accommodate his strange sleeping hours, he needs to make an effort to not disrupt your household too much in exchange for your generous hospitality."
edqry6,NTA. Your dad is showing favoritism and he knows it and should be called on it
edqwaf,"NTA 

Tell your sister to keep that foot down and do not budge.  Just because Gma is enabling the Aunt doesn't mean she has to. Time and Time again, the Aunt has proved herself that she is not to be trusted. Your sister is in the right here. Doing family and friends favors without contracts usually ends with disaster."
edqyrp,"NTA because they are your clothes and you don't have to share them. She doesn't have a right to them if you bought them.

Stop sharing any clothes with each other though instead of picking a choosing particular items. Just wear your own stuff."
edqyrx,I teach 13 year olds and there’s a very easy way to deal with this. Be direct. “Stop picking your nose that’s disgusting and gross.” YTA for being passive about it.
edr13d,NTA please report the unsafe practices and the treatment of workers. Too many people don’t like to rock the boat.
edr2x5,"Nta to tell someone who invited themselves that you can't host them. But your husband should do it, not you. 

Sorry sis. We have the day planned and since we weren't planning on you attending, we just can't make that work. Let's meet up in January."
edr3cd,"YTA. You don’t need to chastise her to you wife, she’s worried about her sister. Stop being an ass and be there to support your wife."
edr4cu,"YTA. If he was doing his job well there was absolutely no reason to report him. It’s not your job to vet people, that’s HR’s responsibility. Plus you don’t know his situation in life. Maybe he needed that job. Maybe he has a wife and family or parents to support and you potentially could’ve just ruined his life. You’re a huge asshole."
edr4s4,"NTA

She going to have to learn one way or another, that you gotta do your assignments. Better now in what I assumed is high school, than post-secondary where you are paying for classes."
edraq3,"NTA 

Though thank goodness this came up before you gave him the DNA kit. Your right that there will never really be a good time now, his mum has definately left it too late. 

I wouldn't recommend it but a sure fire way of forcing the issue would be to give your boyfriend the DNA kit anyway. Not worth it for christmas but maybe necessary if it hasn't come up by his birthday. 

What I would recommend would be talking with his mother one more time, explaining again what a difficult position shes put you in. If shes still not budging then talk with your boyfriend, say his mum let somthing slip to you that you are finding hard to keep from him but that he really needs to hear directly from his mum, and be there for him. This is going to be rough whatever way it goes."
edrddf,"YTA
It’s not pointless to learn to do laundry like an adult. Hot washing isn’t even necessary; if you’re talking about saving energy you should at least be right about it. Cold water is sufficient for most clothes since modern detergents dissolve just fine now. 

By learning “the hard way” I’m guessing you destroyed some of her things. I hope you replaced them."
edre2q,"NTA

But who goes to work for free? Unless you meant you are salaried and need to do weekends to finish some other shit."
edrecn,"NTA. I'm sure your girlfriend was touched by you including her son. I would go with n-a-h, except your mom shouldn't be reaming you out over it."
edrekz,"NTA. Dude, she is throwing red flag after red flag. I don't think that means she's crazy or y'all should break up, but can you imagine having a family with her? Say goodbye to your parents, brother, and friends. 

The way you describe her makes her sounds very manipulative and self-centered."
edremr,Anyone who thinks you're the asshole doesn't have chronic pain. NTA.
edreyo,"NTA, as long as you're not rude about it. You could ask in the comments: ""Is this an MLM?"" and call her out if she tries to deny it, then hopefully other people would be forewarned. If she asks you directly to buy something from her or join, say, ""I don't get involved in MLMs""--repeat as needed (or block). 

MLMs are the worst, especially with how they ruin relationships."
edrg8k,"ESH - Your friend sucks for not being responsible like a normal person should be. She should know her limits. You suck because you let her drive home under the influence. If you ever wonder if someone isn’t able to drive home safe, odds are they probably aren’t. The only reason I’m not directly saying YTA is because it’s hard to reason with intoxicated people, but use this as a lesson."
edrjnp,"YWBTA. Your heart is in the right place, but this is a *terrible* way to approach this discussion with them. If you want to talk about it, then talk about it honestly and openly. Tossing a ""shock-value (for them)"" book into the holiday book exchange is just a cheap ""gotcha."" It won't accomplish anything."
edrn55,YTA for fucks sake just say thank you for the thoughtful gift
edroix,"NTA

Your neighbour sounds like a horrible person"
edrpmk,"YTA. Once that gets into a kid's head, it can be very hard to shake, and they may start ""seeing"" ghosts in the classroom and elsewhere."
edrtn4,"NTA. If she wants to keep an item for her break she should have set it aside at the start of her shift, not leave it on display. 

Both her and her manager had really poor attitudes. I'd make a complaint to the resort manager."
edrut1,"NTA. You invite who you want.  If you feel the need,  you can explain why you didn't invite her parents."
edrvlx,"YTA. You hid them in a communal fridge that the whole family uses, dumb move."
edrw00,"NTA
You didn’t know that she didn’t want to talk to you. You were not pushy, and you expected to receive even a little ‘are you okay?’  You were there for her, expected nothing in return, but when push comes to shove, she was not there for you."
edrw74,"YTA. For starters she lives there too as far as we can see. You can’t dictate what she does and doesn’t watch. And I looked up the show, it’s a show centered around a serial killer. I don’t think it’s so serious that she has to not watch it. This just seems really dramatic. And it could just be me but if it’s that bad for you, it just kinda makes more sense to me for you to put the headphones on and plug them up to your computer....not her plug up headphones to the tv."
edrwtl,"Oh my goodness this is terrible and no, you are NTA to the highest degree. This is bullying, this is disrespectful, and this is a whole host of other things that are really bad. 

Did they delete the photos? Did you tell an adult? How old are you? I’m sorry this happened to you."
eds04i,"Friends are definitely capable of going to each other’s houses alone, hanging out for the whole day, and going to events together - those aren’t actions that are mutually exclusive to couples. My best friend (M22) and I used to do that all the time, I even took him to all of my proms when we were in high school. Don’t read into actions because you want something to be there - you’ll only hurt yourself in the end. 
She probably didn’t feel comfortable telling you about her SO because she knew you had feelings for her. She’s definitely allowed to keep her personal life private, so I think the accusation of her leading you on is very unwarranted. It’s understandable that you are uncomfortable, but you are the one that created that environment for yourself by reading into her friendly actions and getting your hopes up even though she already expressed no intention of being with you. YTA for blaming how you feel on her, YWBTA for avoiding them (more so her than the guy, he sounds like he sucks). Get closure if you need to, take time to move on and understand that you can find someone other than her, but don’t get rid of what seems like a great friend because of this huge misunderstanding. I Hope this all works out for you in the end and you get whatever closure you need, I know this must feel bad. If you’re still keen on ending the friendship, just understand there might not be a way to repair it if you feel like being friends with her again"

eds0ze,"NTA. I’m on my 8th Christmas without my blood family and I couldn’t be happier. There comes a time when you need to assess how much you’re putting into a relationship and how much you’re getting out of it and make the decision if it’s worth it to you. When is the last time visiting them has brought you genuine joy? Can you depend on them in an emergency? Have they offered you friendship or comfort? What exactly are you getting out of this relationship? If it’s nothing but animosity at worst or indifference at best is that really something you want to maintain? Whatever decision you make, I hope you find happiness."
eds25d,"NTA, I'll never understand people who flip out over trivialities like this. My guess is, she felt bad asking you, had her guilt validated by you, and was already pre-determined to lash out by calling you names. Has your mother shown other signs of immaturity before this?"
eds2sh,"NTA, this was horrifically inappropriate. How did your boyfriend react, and what was the nature and outcome of the discussion you had with him?"
eds48g,"You are seriously overthinking it.  There is nothing weird about it and is a thoughtful, fun gift.  YTA"
edsexn,"YTA if you tell her it’s a burden when you acknowledge it’s not actually burdening you.

It sounds like your mom not working is probably a much bigger issue - have you talked to her about getting a license and a job?"
edsezg,"NTA, as long as you approach it out of concern and not judgement.   Your phrasing will mean everything."
edsgdd,"NAH - Damn, this is hard. I really understand both sides. Considering this has been a tradition for the last 10 years, I *really* wouldn’t blame you if you went. But please make sure to reassure your boyfriend that it’s not HIS fault he can’t go. If you said anything about “it’s not my fault you have PTSD,” you would 1000% be the asshole. 

I know this isn’t an advice sub but I can’t help myself - *Gently* explain to/remind him this is a tradition that you’ve been doing with your friends for a very long time, and maybe offer some kind of compromise. Maybe you can meet him somewhere for a new year’s kiss? Maybe you can spend a lot of time with him and show up late? If neither of these are possible - maybe promise to spend the entire New Year’s Day with him."
edsmdf,NTA. What the heck is that about? Why can’t he clean up his own room? Is he an infant? Disabled? Mentally challenged?
edsohg,"NTA. This is literally why every episode of Price Is Right ends with a plea to ""help control the pet population. Have your pets spayed or neutered.""

Declawing is wrong. Neutering is not. It's literally a public health hazard at this point."
edsqc0,"It’s hard to judge you because: 

1) you were 15 and were put on the spot
2) you meant well
3) your friend is doing better now (allegedly)

But from an objective viewpoint, you weren’t helping her by taking her test for her; you were enabling her. ESH"
edsve0,"NTA. 

I think everyone has their limits and you reached yours.

edt1rc,[deleted]
edt1u5,"NTA

Woah wait she doesn’t buy birthday presents for your actual kids yet is mad that you aren’t giving cash valued gifts for Christmas to her adult children??

Emphasis on cash value because sending cards does have value. 
I love cards. It’s nice to have a collection of them as well, small things make you feel loved during the holidays. 

She is definitely being the AH here because of that alone. 


But why aren’t you calling them your niece or nephews? Am I misunderstanding the relationship here..?

I love the gifts my aunts and uncles send. I’m 25 and only the closest ones still do send gifts, the rest I still receive cards from. My youngest aunt, has two kids now, just sends those family holiday photo cards and it still goes up on the fridge every year cus it’s a damn cute picture of my baby cousins. I’ve never gave it second thought why she stopped giving other gifts because I’m aware enough to know what comes with raising kids in this day. And I wouldn’t be putting $20 up on my fridge each year or in a box under the bed (card collection.. I know but I like them)."
edt20e,"NTA - I understand they may not be able to afford childcare, nor is it plausible for such a short amount of time. But this isn’t *your* or your coworker’s issue. The kids are clearly disrupting your work. It’d be one thing if she controlled them - my boss brought her child in ONE time (in over a year), and while she was old enough to not be disruptive, she was still as calm as could be. She gave her a tablet or something and she just sat very quietly by her desk with none of us even noticing her."
edt4ul,"NAH. You don’t have to meet anyone you don’t want to, even if he is your half-brother. It is not your responsibility to placate anyone or pretend you want to have a relationship if you don’t, because that will cause more harm than good in the long run.

Your parent is trying to be supportive of your transition, maybe in your opinion excessively supportive by pushing you to talk to your half-brother. Unless she has transitioned, it’s probably hard for her to imagine what you’re going through, even if you’re transitioning well, and may be thinking OMG there is someone else IN OUR FAMILY who can answer my son’s questions. I don’t think she’s trying to hurt you or negatively compare you to your half-brother’s process, she just probably sees what she thinks as the perfect accessible resource for you and that’s why she’s pushing.

Just tell your parent honestly, “I appreciate you being so supportive of me, but I feel like I’m going through the process of transitioning well, and I know you don’t mean to hurt me but sometimes I have a hard time when you compare me to [half-brother]. And I know you think it should be easy to talk to him because we’re technically related, but I don’t have an interest in talking to him or having a relationship with him.”

Just curious: do you have a relationship at all with your half-sister?"
edt6fg,NTA. I can almost guarantee that it’s not actually a rule
edtabr,"NTA he said no strings attached. Take it, forget about him. Keep a copy of him saying said no strings attached and that it's a gift. You get money, you get closure, and you have evidence if he tries to twist it."
edtarm,[deleted]
edtchp,"YWBTA to keep pushing it as you plan. You should devote what time you have left to finding a family member or friend who will become your daughter's guardian when you pass. The 4 years between now and adulthood are more important than college money. Your daughter is nothing more than a stranger who likely evokes painful memories for your ex, and he  has already said no, so continuing to push him about it will only anger him and waste your time."
edtczn,"NTA. If you're getting hurt by trying to help your sis, you should stop for the sake of yourself."
edtelj,"NTA. But you have to ask yourself if you want a boyfriend who has to be told what to do, or one who willingly wants to spend time with you. 

I’d tell him to do what he wants to do, and make a decision based on what his choice was."
edten1,"This was not what I expected to read on this post. Assumed your family would be pissed you followed the rules at all to respect your roommate. 

Instead, it's the other end of the spectrum.

I've got to be honest, your roommate almost couldn't get a better non Muslim roommate.

You both are lucky to have each other. You seem to have found a great, respectful dynamic.

Rest easy. Your family is being bananas"
edteuu,"YTA. My boyfriend and I don't share a bed because I *cannot* sleep with him there. He talks, he grabs me in his sleep, he snores, I lay there all night hyper aware of his breathing and never get to sleep. He's an adult and accepts this limitation. The fact that your ex could sleep in bed with you has nothing to do with your current boyfriend's inability to do so! He's proposing an easy solution and you refuse because ""it's your office."" Sounds self centered to me! There's also a good chance that sleeping on a couch long term will give him back pains. That happened to me when I slept on the couch every day for ~1 year. Move your office stuff to the living room and let him have his own bedroom."
edtfr0,NTA she chose to return it she can disassemble and ship it. She's a big girl.
edtgaf,"YTA, and you know you are! 

It's not unreasonable to want to sleep at night.
Gaming and talking at 2am loudly enough to wake them up is totally asshole behaviour!"
edthl5,"NTA. Never put a woman’s laundry in the dryer without asking first. Most women already know this and I’m guessing guys posting here just don’t know how much of our shit has to be dried very carefully. Delicate panties, most bras, knit tops.. You really have to ask first unless you’re okay with literally destroying the clothes you’re drying."
edthnr,NAH. His friends are TA.
edthuo,NAH don't tell people you took the picture until he does or doesn't dress up as Santa.
edtj9e,"The fact that you're NTA in this situation to an outside observer isn't going to stop your in-laws from being upset. You need to sit down with him and explain to him your concerns, since they almost certainly *will* wonder why you didn't do it because it *is* almost always the wives who select gifts. His silence will effectively chuck you under the bus, so he needs to use his grown up words and talk to his own family and explain why he's made the decision to be a miser.

If at all possible, I would try to get something small for the kids, though. They're not going to understand what's going on like an adult would."
edtkgl,"NTA.  They can’t have it both ways.  If they want you out of the picture, then they shouldn’t be making requests of you."
edtm04,"NAH - But I would start trying to correct it. Obviously, don’t say “I’m not your mom, don’t call me that,” but can you start saying “no, auntie!” or something like that back to him? Still - you’re not an asshole because it’s not like you deliberately had him call you mama. And while your sister has issues of her own which lead her to not be the best mother, I wouldn’t blame her for being upset about it. In this specific situation, she isn’t an asshole, either."
edtn0i,"NTA.  You’re giving everyone a gift, and that, in itself, is generous of you."

edtu8b,NTA. Make the extra holiday pay and have an enjoyable time with your daughter!
edtuku,ESH what the fuck is wrong with middle schoolers honestly
edty2p,"ESH - you made a bunch of poor choices. You SHOULD have been an adult and let your dad know your schedule in the first place. Once they chose the wrong dates, you should have declined as it was during finals. By moving finals up, you lost out on a week of studying / reviews / any material that was covered during that time and as you said, trashed your grades. That was not helped by working double shifts during the same time.  You are 29, start acting like an adult - you don't always get to do the fun things, especially when you screwed up the planning by not being involved.

Also, what type of cruise ship charges for meals?  Maybe they have changed, but you only had to pay for the ""uncharged"" restaurants, but regular food was included.

Family was a bit crappy by not checking with you in the first place and just expecting you to make the dates work. If you are 29, working, and in school, they should have known you would have at least had to ask for the time off."

It's unfortunate that your husband is stuck in the position of wanting to care for his mother and his family, but he has to make a choice."
edv2wz,"Your husband should have a conversation with his mother and you should take this opportunity to step back.

It could be really good for you to try to celebrate Christmas with her and the kids, but it's not your fault that the Christmas season reminds you of former trauma and just generally leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

She could kennel the dog, use pee pads, litter train her, keep her in the guest room, put a diaper on her, or ummmm fucking carry her outside and gently put her down to per, pick her up and bring her in..... so many things rather than let her piss all over your house. 

What you’ve done is called Natural Consequences.

Second, things happen. My sister did a first year at a uni and flunked out, came back home and did a community college while living at home until she felt ready to go back to UNI

Your daughter has a once in a lifetime opportunity here. I absolutely understand your fear of the industry, and your concerns though.

However, it CAN be mitigated by parenting. You can make stipulations like keep a ____ GPA, no industry parties, doing volunteer work to remember reality, maintain childhood friendships, etc. 

My diehard dream as a child was to be an actress. I got one of these shots and my parents said no, though I was only 10ish and it was after an audition. While I maintained a good relationship with my parents in the end; it destroyed my self-confidence, shattered our relationship for a while, and I'm trying not to cry now, at 34, because it is a painful hole of ""what if"". 

Let her at least try. Reach out to counselors to help you and her navigate this. Stay incredibly active in grounding her. If *she* really wants this though... please don't crush her."

edyhuq,"NTA. What do you mean by “helping”? He lives there, right? It’s his kid, right? Parenting your own kid and cleaning your own house isn’t “helping.” It’s an expectation and part of being an adult. Don’t perpetuate the idea that men can’t be real parents and are only helpers. Men can and should be involved in parenting as often as possible. It’s important for your own sanity and it’s important for the kids."
edyico,"YTA.

A tricky situation since you can't help how you feel but you're the asshole simply because you're essentially demanding that she stop to the point that your friendship is going down the drain and even your family have taken her side.

You can express your discomfort and your feelings towards her calling by family names but you cannot demand it and expect them to just do as they are told especially when it's baseless and arguably selfish because it's purely based on how you feel whilst everyone else is okay with it.

If she chooses to listen to you then sure but if she doesn't want to then you can't force her not to and it clearly isn't worth having a fight with your family over."
edyjw1,NTA - she was representing TJ by wearing the uniform and acting a damn fool. I would absolutely report her behavior - make racism shameful again.

No need to confront imo, if they can't even respect you enough to explain why and decided to play games then they aren't worth the time you give to for them to explain.

You had me thinking that I would answer differently until you said you had already spent so much time with your Dad’s family AND you didn’t want to just stay for Christmas, but for New Year as well. I believe that what makes YTA is that it’s so close to Christmas to change your mind and the amount of time/ special days you’re missing with your Mom. Maybe it would be better if you left the 26th to go see your Mom, but still definitely weigh the pros and cons on this one."

You are probably at an age where your parents are starting to allow you to do things on your own/ on your own terms. If you keep showing them you are responsible, they will slowly give you more freedom! (just wait till you turn 16 and start driving!) At the end of the day, your parents want the best for you.

Family lip kissing is weird but that’s not so much the issue. 

There are two things here: one, lip kissing raises the chances of virus being passed around (like herpes) and two, it doesn’t teach her body autonomy and boundaries. For the latter reason, *no one* should be demanding kisses or hugs."
edz8xn,"NTA - First of all, why did you have to Uber there? Could she not Uber back herself? I find this odd. 

Besides that, she was out of line. Was she drunk? That somewhat explains her actions but doesn’t excuse them. Unless this was a regular thing you’ve done, she could’ve just told you she thinks it’s dangerous to leave your stuff out like that. You’re not a child, this “lesson” would frustrate many adults. Sure, you didn’t have to snap, but I also don’t blame you."

Make it cheaper and cheaper each time to the point that the gift is completely useless (like a homemade PlayStation). When he questions it, repeat back to him what he told you about the gift he got you. Of course, expect him to never actually get you a nice gift again. I’d call it worth it though."
ee0io2,NTA. You’re just giving pointers to the pointers.
ee0jlp,"YTA if you don't talk about this as a group and make a group decision about how to move forward.

Some groups of players will enjoy a challenge and want to face real consequences of those actions. If you take that away from them you are hurting their enjoyment of the game... your one job as GM is to make sure they have fun in the game. 

Other groups will think that the story is much better if nothing can stop it. For them, they would much rather they all wake up as captives of the hobgoblins who used their own magic to heal them so that they could be used in a sacrifice and now the PCs get to try and escape... or whatever story driven reason you come up with. 

Still other players expect that you will pull punches such that this never happens in the first place. 

While I personally fall into the first camp and believe the chance of dying adds a lot when my character succeeds, players who prefer the other solutions aren't wrong. There isn't a wrong way to do this other than if you unilaterally decide what is going to happen for the group instead of having a group concensus on how this should go down. 

Ideally this type of conversation should happen at the start of a campaign so everyone is on the same page and not in the moment... but you are where you are now. Talk to the group and as a group decide how to proceed. 

For the future (or right now if you let the dead stay dead) look up what Session 0 is and look at making that part of your campaigns going forward.

Yeah your mother said something homophobic, but she’s trying to support your sister and she said it to *you*, so she could safely say these things and try to figure out what’s okay to say to her daughter. She might be overreacting to your comment, but she’s having a hard time adjusting (and she definitely is *trying* to adjust), so I’d cut her some slack. She’s not an asshole. 

Assuming you didn’t say this specifically to attack your mother, just to give her some guidance, you’re not an asshole either. Maybe try to word your feedback to her a bit more constructively in the future since she’s clearly being sensitive right now. 

Good for both of you supporting your sister: your mother by working to learn new ways of seeing people and to try out her concerns with you first instead of with her, and you for helping her to modify her language. This is hard work you’re both doing here, and you should both be proud of it."
ee0mpw,"This may be unpopular but I’m going with ESH. You were absolutely right to call her out, she is obviously terrible. However, you should not have dragged Kevin into this situation.

After a long period of being left out in different ways, I'm sure it feels good to realise that it's not necessarily because there's something wrong with you, you just do things a bit differently (maybe abnormally) but it's clearly working for you.

As a side note, when things calm down make sure your siblings understand you don't wish for them to be unsuccessful; calmly give them 1 or 2 examples of other times you feel they've taken similar stances against you which triggered the response but you don't hold it against them and don't believe it's worth fighting over."

You should be talking to her about this.  Figuring out what she likes about the new family and what she doesn't.  Maybe to her spending the holidays with just you was an amazingly special experience which you are now shitting all over.  Maybe she feels like an outsider with this new family.  Maybe it's just too big of a change to happen so quickly.

ee22eo,"First of all NAH, so just know that. 

When it comes to advice on how to move forward though, this is very complicated.  You always have a right to treat hard drugs as a total deal breaker, but obviously you like this girl a lot, and when that's the case and you want to keep her around, the best thing is always to try and meet people half way.  

It's important for you to understand that some of these drugs are par for the course in the festival culture, so if your girlfriend goes to these things and is into that scene etc., I think its given she will be doing drugs every now and again.  You two should talk about this more candidly, obviously you have different views on these things.  But I would caution you against giving an ultimatum or something like that if you want to keep the girl, because that's just something you do as a last resort and it rarely ends well.   Try to understand her point of view, no to drugs period for her will essentially mean quitting the scene that she clearly enjoys very much, and that's not necessarily a fair ask.  On the other hand, obviously you have a right to be upset because she appears to have led you to believe drugs are a thing of the past.   At any rate, communicate, sit down and have a conversation.  

If you really care about her and want to keep her around, do not give her ultimata for things that are not life threatening or seriously jeopardizing your quality of life.  I get that you have deal breakers, but she is a real person, and we don't get to pick and choose which parts of the person we like we want to keep, and which parts we want to discard.  My sense is that if she does these rarely, if ever, she is eventually just going to phase them out.  Most people grow tired of the shit as they get older.  Of course it's up to you how patient you want to be.

ee2520,"NTA.  It’s your vacation.  You get to offer it to who you want. And no one would blame you if you want to share it with people that make you feel good and happy instead of being weird, passive aggressive and gossipy."
ee26av,[deleted]
ee28zr,"NAH

However, you need to sort this out with your wife. The fact that ""You sit home all day"" sounds more like an excuse than a reason. There may be something that you can't see, but your wife is 'suffering' from."
ee293c,"NTA. John would not even be a contender for the promotion, so if you didn’t take it, someone else would. Of course you deserve it, you’ve worked hard. You can feel empathy for John’s situation, but you cannot sacrifice yourself because of it."
ee29jy,"YTA; doesn’t matter if he wasn’t completely moved in yet. You entered his room without his permission and did the nasty on HIS couch.
Which you can’t even wash?

Why didn’t you go back to her place?"
ee2d77,"NTA she shouldn't leave her bank details on someone else's online login. You or anyone you allow to use your account could have used them at any time. There is an option to not save the payment details...

Thay said, you should offer to split it (reminding her of your financial difficulties) to keep the peace... if the bank won't refund it once provided with the details."
ee2ejt,"YTA

If you didn't tell her when she first took it that you might want it back someday, YTA. It's her property now."
ee2hux,NTA. They said no gifts and should have stuck to it. Hopefully your sister will be gracious.
ee2jz3,YTA. It's customary for guests to supply sides while host usually does turkey and beverages.
ee2kga,"This story made me sad. It’s hard to tell from this little information, but the way you tell it sounds to me like he’s just reaching out for attention when he wants it. I would have to say YWNBTA."
ee2kgu,"NTA. 

First I think that the fact that you’re family doesn’t mean you have an obligation to back her up no matter what. Family can be toxic too.  

Also she IS racist. If she is posting post with the N word publicly in her Facebook she is outing herself as a racist person. And she was fine with having those posts on her profile until people noticed and her pledge to get money was affected."
ee2lhq,[deleted]
ee2ylb,NTA but I have an idea buy speakers aim them at their wall and play Soviet national anthem when they do it to get them to stop if not ask police about it
ee2zff,"Someone who picks fights, calls you rude names, mocks you, accuses you of lying, follows you to continue an argument when you walk away, and gaslights you is not a ""great catch."""
ee338o,"YTA, but only because it's her abuser's end game to have her totally isolated and dependent on him, and this would be playing in to it. One of my friends was in an abusive relationship and it was HARD. But I stayed there for her even when he was doing his best to get me out of her life. When she left I helped with money so she could physically get out of there and I'm her shoulder when she needs support. The thing about abusive relationships is that it's hard to see red flags through rose tinted glasses - they're just flags. And abusers manipulate and gaslight and she'll likely think it's all in her head or she's overreacting. 

You have to find ways to take care of yourself and sometimes that does mean distancing yourself, just make sure you're there for when she tries to escape. He's the real asshole here, but playing into his game truly endangers your friend."
ee3a4k,NTA. He shouldn’t be taking your stuff especially if you’ve already had an issue with this.
ee3an6,"Two people scream obsceneties at eachother, and your solution, because this offends you, is to start shouting too....
Capital idea."
ee3beh,Fuck no NTA. Shame on her for shaming you.
ee3g3j,"NTA They sound unreasonable. I'd suggest going to your landlord and explaining how they are harrassing your parents with complaints rather than going through the landlord.
That way, if they have genuine grievances you can work at a solution, or, as seems more likely, you will have called their bluff and they will back off."
ee3gsq,[deleted]
ee3kg2,"Uh. Christmas is such a time of fun! /s NTA they are treating you like their babysitter, you’re a fucking adult, you get to play at the adults’ table and the people who decided to have children should fucking look after them."
ee3n73,[deleted]
ee3r8i,"NTA I’d watch out for her mate, I think that was a deliberate plot to drive a wedge between you two. She might start a campaign of disinformation and manipulation to isolate your brother from your family. I think she will try something with your parents next so watch out for any drama involving them in the future, pay very close attention to the details. she will most likely use the same tricks she did with her family so at least you know what to look out for. Good luck."
ee3u56,NTA. It’s unfair of her to assume that you would just bite the cost of travel for both of you. You don’t owe her that.
ee3w8g,"ESH. Your best friend sounds like a teenager, dictating who can and cannot be friends with his ex, you for playing into these high school games. Your wife for not discussing it with you, instead of storming to her parents place."
ee3wot,"Before this crush asked you out, you were already distancing yourself. We do that sometimes when things are not working and we don’t see long term in the friendship. 

It’s also easy to feel clouded, cos even though you distances yourself, you still miss that person. I would advise drawing line in the sand and moving on. 

Friendships ending is harder than romantic relationships ending in my opinion and it takes a whole process to get over it."
ee3x2t,NTA. Your dad's being a jerk. And he should be paying you something since you're working for a business and not just doing household chores.
ee41gt,"Info.  Why is everyone afraid to just talk to your sister?.  It is not yours or your moms responsibility to buy presents or food for everyone esp with a one day notice.   Tell your sister she needs to get more food as you only planned for x a,punt and don’t worry about not having presents for everyone."
ee45ae,"NAH. I've been on the other side of this: I was in the ass-end of nowhere at 2am with a very wasted ex and the taxi we called told us he couldn't take him like that and left. I wasn't in any danger and, difficult as it was, I a d two friends helped sober the idiot up and we took the next taxi home in about an hour, who was also very apprehensive.

To my understanding, if a person throws up in a taxi, it needs to be professionally bio-cleaned to prevent anything happening to other passengers for safety reasons. That sounds like a major hassle and headache, and possibly expensive.

Sucks to be those passengers who may be having trouble getting home, but you need to direct your livelihood, too."
ee48dj,"If you pick up a cake for yourself at your own home NTA

If you mean to bring this cake to your mothers with the cake she made you YTA"
ee4cd8,NTA It is completely unreasonable for your mother to hold you responsible for your brother's inability or unwillingness to get up in the morning. She needs to direct her ire towards her irresponsible son rather than diverting it on to you.
ee4f2y,"NTA, if something makes you uncomfortable , you should definitely speak up. Talking about politics and religions is one thing, but making such a remark is another. More than religion, it was an asshole comment. Because a lot of religions don’t allow a lot of things and find things sinful, but no one goes around telling people what they do or wear is wrong. In my religion, eating meat is a sin, I am vegetarian, but that doesn’t mean I won’t respect people who eat meat, that’s just stupid."
ee4geq,Yta - not because you want to return the odd presents (though it is rude I don't apply that cause they dicks). But holy shit your closing. How is it crossing the line. You want nice headphones and your dad's willing to get you them? ASK. stop being childish and expecting people to know what you want and getting annoyed when they don't. The gifts are odd but he seems to be jabbing at you for not knowing what you want. Figure out what you want and be vocal about it or you won't ever get it. Also what the actual fuck you are complaining about gifts you haven't even received yet?!?!?
ee4kl0,"NTA. But why do you let your wife just tell you what you'll be doing with your holidays? It sounds like you're virtually living separate lives, and she just issues orders."
ee4lyk,"It seems I am against the grain here but these responses seem  harsh.  If she truly didn’t acknowledge you or make any effort to make you feel included then that isn’t really the behavior or a proud loving partner. I could see a lot of more reserved folks feeling like crap in a situation like that. You really couldn’t expect one on ones, but a hello and a kiss wouldn’t have been too much to ask. Perhaps I’m wrong but it doesn’t seem like you were really asking to be the center of attention but really more for her to introduce you and make you feel like she wanted you there. Idk NTA to me but you really should have made more of an effort to get to know people without her facilitation.

Edit: it seems like I’m not as against the grain as I thought. When I wrote this comment I was the only one not saying they were an asshole. Glad folks agree because I was really questioning my instincts."
ee4sme,"NTA, you’re a damn child who saved up a huge amount of money (‘specially for your age) and bought your mother a very nice gift. She was ungrateful. I’m sorry this happened."
ee4uwx,NTA.  I would contact the police since they’re harassing you.
ee4xgg,"NTA and honestly people bringing sick children to events so they dont ""miss out"" is one of my pet peeves. If they are sick keep them home and let their bodies fight the illness, do  not  bring  that  crap  in  to  my  house !!"
ee4ya4,ESH- but only for waiting for the last minute to cancel. This isn’t a new habit tang just happened. You had forever to decide and now it’s tomorrow. Also it may be good for your kids even if they’re not around much. Your parents suck for all of the obvious reasons
ee5258,"Let me put it this way. She spent an hour crying in the bathroom.

What do you think?

If that's not enough to go on, here are some other hints:

You blamed her appearance-- or, quite frankly, ANYTHING, my man, anything at all-- on her menstrual cycle.

You're talking a lot about her weight. Really a lot. You also said she was sweet and kind, which is great, lucky you! But you gave no details about that, just a lot of details about her weight and her struggles with it.

Yes, YTA."
ee53we,NTA. Cant really call them an asshole for wanting you to be social and experience life as much as you don't want to. Can call them an asshole for expecting you to act a certain way and judging/insulting you tho.
ee5amx,"Retaliating is not going to help your situation. Sounds like your parents are being unkind to you. That sucks. The best you can do in this situation is to be kind to them, but also let them know if they hurt you with their words and actions. 

Good luck."
ee5bj7,"NTA, regardless any condition of your mom, she is not quite thinking on what she is doing. I understand she wants to have as much attention possible, of thats what I feel, however having 3 guys that were related to her in more than friendship is not a good idea, she may feel good having them there, however them and you will feel uncomfortable. I really sorry for the previous chritsmases you guys had, but this time I think you need to talk to your mom a little careful and express her your feelings, let her know that you want something happy and special not only for you as well for her"
ee5bxj,"NAH - If you otherwise like the watch, why have it sitting there not being used? The ex who gave it to you wanted you to enjoy it. The only other option I’d see is to sell/pawn it."
ee5fsc,"NTA - you didn't hmm for a ticket, they didn't ask you if you wanted one. It was their choice to buy one. Maybe they can sell it to someone else"
ee5ij4,"NAH.

Everyone likes to spend Christmas with those they love. It's about finding a proper compromise.

How about set up a new arrangement.
On Christmas day... 
One year your parents
One year his parents

And just alternate.

Or, perhaps, you host once every 3 years. And invite both sides (space allowing)"
ee5l2h,"ESH, I think we should, as a society, learn how to have some composure when it comes to customer service decisions. If you're not getting the help you need because she doesn't have the power to make those decisions, then you need to continue higher up the chain, instead of losing your mind and swearing at people who work in a call center. They didn't create the policies.

That said, I used to manage a customer satisfaction focused call center, and if I heard one of my agents start a sentence with, ""what you need to understand is..."" they would have been pulled off the phone and coached."
ee5nt8,NTA. Apartment complexes typically have noise restrictions in the lease for a good reason. No one should have to be disturbed by constant noise.
ee5uwq,"NTA - and, his response to you makes him TA.

I wouldn't worry about it, if I were you..."
ee5v19,NAH because you don't have to go if you don't want.  But you are overthinking the reason you were invited and there is need for you to be trying to give up your seat for others.  If he wanted people to be there he'd invite them.
ee5vl4,"NTA because you didn't set out to humiliate him.  You left him with decent hair he just can't hide behind.  

Actions have consequences.  He is learning that.  I know many girls that age who have been forced into haircuts by their parents because they won't take care of their long hair and it becomes a tangled mess.  

Fair enough.  Kids can't always make great decisions."
ee5vv1,"NTA.

If he is calling you a good 2 shoes for not stealing then you are totally within your rights to leave. That's just lame peer pressure. Honestly you probably did the best option possible."
ee5z85,"NTA, but your mom is TA. She is prioritizing a present over your health. She seems to need to get her priorities in order. Also, communicate to your uncle and aunt your health condition and say you really appreciate the gift but warn them you'd never be able to wear it. Then, suggest a different gift you've wanted and really sell it to them by saying, ""Oh I've been wanting this for months and I'll actually use it everyday!"""
ee63f7,"NAH, this is a great idea. My sister does this every year, and I think handmade gifts are much more special than bought stuff."
ee68b7,"NTA

This is a recipe for disaster. Half of the 4 pages is about the ex??? What happens after you finish reading it? You suppose to feel good you got with her when she was head over heels in love with him? You start comparing yourself to the ex? Start wondering if she wishes you had this particular trait or quality? 

On a more positive note, maybe there is something in there like ""go skydiving with ex"" and she just wants to feed you that idea... How childish, she should just tell you then and skip the whole reading exercise."

ee6cdr,"YTA. 

You’re the parent. You chose to have another child. Not them. You made the decision and now you want them to cater their lives around you. You’re the selfish one. Hands down. 

You can’t force your children to parent your children, especially when they’re young adults trying to establish themselves in the world.

If you play favorites with your will based on the manipulative demands and expectations you have that your children will put their lives second to yours, then yes, you are 100-percent the asshole. 

It’s one thing to have an unequal will to protect and prepare for your autistic son’s long term care, but absurd that you’d punish your daughters for having healthy boundaries with your selfish demands.

ETA: your youngest daughter isn’t a hero, and you’ve set her up for years of codependent relationships. You’ve taught her she must always put others needs before her own. It’s not healthy. You think she’s a good kid, but you’ve actually robbed her of her teenage years and development."
ee6d49,anybody else find this hard to follow?
ee6eri,NTA put a stop to this shit now. That’s disgusting.
ee6fvc,"NTA. The language he uses is completely unacceptable, and he's teaching his other kids the wrong things; they're your siblings, and you're justified in wanting to see them raised without idiotic biases."
ee6hm8,"YTA. Not because you don’t have a right to be somewhat concerned, though aggression toward another dog is not the same as toward a child, but you can’t *demand* anything. You’ve lived with them rent free for 10 years. Surely you’ve saved enough in that time to move out if it’s a deal-breaker. 

The better solution is to tell other not to bring their dogs. It’s not the parents job (or their dogs) to welcome other dogs. Problem solved."
ee6k6x,"This is going to get deleted immediately because there's no conflict and you're just seeking advice, but since we're here: no, you're not an asshole. You want the best care you can get, so you should get it, and you don't owe anything to the professional you've been paying to treat you."
ee6lmi,"whoa.  they offered to pay... you said okay sure how about half... and then they said all we didn't really mean to offer to pay.

you win.  they lose.  do whatever you want.  whether you take their money or not they look like idiots."
ee6nvs,"ESH - Sam for the original comment, Lucy for all the reasons you said and you for doing ecactly what your're mad at her for. 

You don't want them to tell her about your party. Why not since you say you think she should talk to sam before just not inviting him to stuff?"
ee6pjx,NTA. You did exactly what you should have done. Everyone in this story sucks except you.
ee6s50,"NTA.  I don’t care where you are, a guest or in your own home.  Your body, your rules.  That includes holding babies.  Sorry you had to deal with that."
ee6uup,"NAH; it’s not a personal gift by any means, so I don’t see anything wrong with giving it to your bf’s sister. That’s probably the best way to make use of it.

Your brother isn’t in the wrong either here; maybe he thought you could use an additional device. No need to feel guilty or let him know what you did with the gift."
ee6xec,"YWBTA 

If you aren’t comfortable offering support then communicate such. 

It’s okay to want distance. But blocking is a bit harsh."
ee72i0,"If this is part of a pattern where they routinely leave you out of things, then NTA, but if it’s a one time thing, skipping Xmas might be an overreaction."
ee73fu,"ESH - I see both sides. I don’t understand the setup, but I’m not sure why you leave your keys out in the hallway. Can’t you leave them in your room? But he also should’ve been more wary of the fact you were home still and not lock you in. I think splitting it sounds fair."
ee77xl,"It's hard to be the outsider of the family.  It's kinda petty to not go because they didn't do the same for you.  If you want to go, go. Mid it isn't healthy for you to go, then don't go.  Do what's best for your mental health, not because they don't favor you.   We don't know the dynamic that you aren't as connected to them, so it's hard to say who the AH is when we don't know the full story."
ee7911,"NTA

You have to buy the flushable wipes or you are going to have plumbing bills in your future."
ee7ad5,"NTA. It sounds like he has an extremely unhealthy relationship with food and could benefit from some help. Carbs aren't the enemy and can be enjoyed moderately as part of a healthy diet. Rather than focusing on the food waste, why not get to the root of the issue and help him learn about healthy eating?"
ee7bzb,"ESH - You are both trying to dictate the terms of the relationship, wanting one only when and how it's convenient for you. It's not healthy."
ee7dlo,"NTA. I think taking Dad’s girlfriend on a trip tradition Mom started is pretty jarring. Your dad didn’t communicate well about bringing friends. I think you’d be the bigger person if you went and you’d definitely be present for your brother, but I don’t think your obligated to go."
ee7g27,"YTA. By now, you should include her in your family celebrations. Why on earth wouldn't you be comfortable leaving your nuclear family over the holidays? If I were her, I would break up with you for being massively inconsiderate and rude."
ee7nve,NTA - But that kid sounds entitled as hell.
ee7sak,"ESH. Never date an ex, unless she's the one. Maybe that's what it was for him. If that was the case he should've told you about it privately before surprising you in front of everyone and causing a scene. He is DEFINITELY TA here. 

On the other hand don't be the guy that stops your friends from dating, it doesn't matter who it is. Your ex, sister, mom, as long as they aren't being a homewrecker you have no business. 

It probably stings and if your friends aren't being supportive then I would argue they aren't really your ""friends"" just people you associate with in your free time."
ee7sc4,"NTA. The game is clearly designed to be offensive, crude, & taken in jest. If he can’t handle it, he’s going to have a rough time in the real world."
ee7tpy,"NTA. They send you articles and comments, then can't handle you replying back to them. You don't have to just take their opinions and keep quiet, you can disagree and voice your opinions too."
ee7tq7,"YTA.   If you are managing someone, or reviewing them, it’s highly unprofessional to joke like you did.

It was also a huge red flag that your solution to her being off put by you was to suggest she spend time with you outside of the office twice per week.

Also, I think the term you are looking for is “informed person” rather than “huge climate change believer.”"
ee7v67,"NTA. But here’s the rub, they may make it a condition of paying for your cell phone. If they do, are you ready to pay for your own? 

As for your parents, I think they are probably being over protective. If one of my kids was living in a different city or was off at college at 20, I’d worry about abduction, etc. Could you tell them that you’ll share your location at all times with a trusted friend who you don’t think is too nosy? Seems like a good compromise."
ee7y9c,"YTA. You had months to find ways to handle your stress, anxiety, and paranoia and instead you decided to let yourself spiral and get more worked up until you had a meltdown. And AFRID is no excuse. You aren't on a restricted diet due to allergies or digestive issues, if you can find food in America you can find it in Europe. And last you were given a free gift that people go their entire lives without experiencing, the chance to expand your mental and cultural horizons again for free, and your response was to basically ensure you couldn't handle it."
ee7yao,"YTA - it’s not your house, you own one small proportion and have equal rights with your resident sibling. 

You don’t live there, you aren’t gaining / losing anything by her being there and the business is nothing to do with you either so how she speaks to the employees is not your concern. 

You’ve basically now denied your sibling access to free childcare, probably caused issues with her and her husband and also sent an older woman to live alone this close to Xmas. 

In a few days you’ll be back home again and won’t care.


I suggest that if you have no need to live in the house you should sell (I’d say give but you don’t seem that type) your share to your sibling and then leave her to get on with her life.

I can imagine you’re the kind of person who would force all your other siblings to sell this property when it’s at your convenience, split the money and then leave your family homeless, but that’s okay because you’re the oldest sibling so it’s your right to do that"
ee829s,"NTA.

This is YOUR HAIR, not your mother's hair or the family's hair. Do whatever you like with it! I'm happy it makes you less dysphoric now :)"
ee83k3,"Yep YTA, just because he is homeless doesn't make him a threat, your neighbors are right it could so easily be you. Also why tell him what's in their garage? So inappropriate. You really do suck"
ee87sl,NTA you have talked to her about what was making you uncomfortable and she wouldnt stop so I'm not sure what else you could have done. Feel a bit sorry for your friend though as it seems like he didnt know how she acts when hes not looking
ee88d4,"ESH - In hindsight, it probably would have been better to participate just so you weren’t blatantly the one out of it. If anything this probably didn’t help your relationship. 

But I also think your grandparents sound like they played favorites which they also suck for doing."
ee8afz,"Step one, new bank account. Step two,  save cat."
ee8ezu,">My best friend even said that you should never let a woman drive your car. 

Hoping this is a troll, but if not, of course YTA. Next."
ee8m34,"NTA - Of course you’re not an asshole. If someone is negatively effecting your work environment and you do not feel comfortable enough telling them to back off, it’s best to go to management. That’s their job - they have the power to change someone’s behavior or eradicate the problem. You’re not a snitch for standing up for yourself."
ee8myj,NTA. You told him what the norm is and he should respect that. The last thing you should want to do in a very traditional country is stand out.
ee8p29,"NTA. That’s pretty low class from your grandma. I know it’s uncool to speak on other people’s families without really knowing them, but she sounds like a grade A condescending bitch. Enjoy your Christmas at home"
ee8rgr,"NTA, she sounds selfish and like she didn’t prioritize her time well, and I have no idea why she’d bring you to his place for a family bbq with his family and then just go off alone with him"
ee8s5b,"NTA

Lmao she got a taste of her own medicine and can't handle it😂"
ee8sf2,"NTA - The best gifts are ones which are given with a lot of thought and attention as to the needs and wants of the recipient, and will give them some happiness or meet a need that they have.  The gifts that your mother gives you are not about your wants or needs, they are about her need to give you ""something material"", and her fantasy of having you unwrap something and be delighted by it - not the reality that they don't suit your lifestyle and just cause work for you, as clutter that you then need to give away.  By getting upset about what you've done with the gift, your mother continues to make it about herself, not you."
ee8u63,NTA - You're not his personal chef.
ee8x23,"Christmas presents don’t have to be expensive. You can always make something thoughtful.

You can offer free services, maybe draw a voucher for them. Like dog walking or cooking them a meal. 

Or you can write a heartfelt letter. One year for my dads birthday I reached out to all of his closest friends and got them to write a sweet message for him. Then I wrote little cards with these messages and put them all in a box (along with book, music and movie recommendations), and told him he could open one when he needed a pick me up. I think that’s the best present I have ever given him."
ee8ylv,"NTA. How old are you? If you're under 18, your dad owes you a place to live. You should be able to get a glass of water in your own house without being screamed at"
ee8ymr,Idk why this is here.
ee916v,NAH it's a locker room which is used to change and shower.
ee91fd,"You're NTA, but maybe when they were late, you could have called another company. Was the price they were charged reasonable/correct? What would the charge from the other taxi service actually have been at that time of night?"
ee91uc,"You don't live there alone, so it's not up to you.
If your grandmother wants to put up decorations she should be able to."
ee93k1,"NAH. This sounds like a complicated issue involving your shared finances that you should probably map out in Excel/post about in another sub. If you guys CAN afford it, get it. I understand if it's frustrating if pricey equipment goes unused, but it's important to find a type of exercise you can do regularly and life is partly about using stuff -- again, if you two would be OK financially if you bought it. If your sole, or main, objection is how often he's given up in the past, then YTA.

Have you guys considered a gym membership?"
ee95l1,"YTA - I wish that we lived in a society where comfort or affection could be expressed physically, without any underlying sexual or romantic meaning - but we don't.  You crossed a line into overfamiliarity.  How would you feel if you came home and found your girlfriend with her head in another guy's lap?"
ee97ye,"NTA, your mom sounds very self-centered"
ee9gzd,"I am a pro gun guy and I have to say NTA. If you can’t be a responsible gun owner, you shouldn’t be a gun owner at all. 

You FIL sounds incredibly irresponsible and frankly as if he is suffering from some mental illness. The idea that he wasn’t comfortable going on a cruise without a gun is just demented. Also guns should be safely locked away or otherwise completely out of any access of children. 

If this bozo is strutting around with a gun on his hip like a poor man’s Wyatt Earp with a three year old around, he is insane!  Do not compromise on this."
ee9rgb,"NTA I would consider it a win that you got her to leave, she sounds rather self centered."
ee9sdb,"YTA, but only just. While I completely get wanting to make this time of year a bit easier and relaxed your Mum doesn’t really seem to have any other Christmas stuff going on. It’s not the food she necessarily misses but the tradition, for years (decades) she would do the whole thing and now that she can’t do it so it’s just gonna get put aside? You and your siblings have in laws and kids and new traditions so it’s not unexpected she’d want to have the old ones to still be there too, especially if she’s getting older and can’t do as much as she used to."
ee9stz,YATA. Wow. You have no right to tell her to move on. She desperately wanted children of her own and is grieving that she can't ever have them. You are cold and should be ashamed.

ee9wac,"YTA - but not because you don't eat them. Its because you are throwing them away! What a waste. Give them to someone else. You may not care for them, but there are plenty of people who would love to have them."
ee9zn2,"YTA Absolutely, doesn't matter that you bought him a new one it was his toaster! Maybe he'd have thrown it out maybe he'd have stored it out of sentimentality. Throwing it yourself Was inconsiderate of his feelings and denying him the choice"
eea00d,"NTA.  You and your friends are capable of getting together without him,  it was his choice to go to his moms house."
eea1bm,"Do you actively identify as Asian in your daily life? If so, go ahead.

But if you don't normally ID as Asian, in my opinion, YTA (or rather you would be TA) for claiming it.

The purpose behind scholarships for specific demographics is to give people a helping hand who are less likely to come from privileged or wealthy backgrounds and more likely to face educational and professional hurdles. If you don't normally identify as anything that the Asian scholarships specifically cover then you'd be gaming the system to apply for it when there are other scholarships you could pursue (as you mention above).

Being genetically 1/4 near-Asian isn't the same as having Asian upbringing or culture. Syria and Lebanon are technically in Asia but are as close to European as one can get given that! They may, or may not, be within the purview those scholarships were designed to cover. The same goes regarding your connection to those roots.

Since you say there are similar scholarships for women and disabled and queer people, these make a lot more sense to me for you to try for, alongside any other major portions of your personal experience (such as the Arab descent one, as that is definitely accurate). The key here is to thoroughly check out what the qualification criteria are of any scholarships you apply for and to be honest with yourself about whether it matches you."
eea3mr,"NTA, but I would recommend going to couples therapy to discuss finances."
eea3r3,[deleted]
eea51p,NTA. Congrats to you!!
eea9pf,NTA. You're supposed to feel low and isolated after a miscarriage. It is a really unfortunate ocurrence and I am really sorry; I hope you get better. It was inconsiderate of your mother and your relative to not care for you and to ask you to come to their house respectively.
eeafzo,"NAH, without even commenting on the specific situation, it's obvious neither of you were 100% into it to begin with, so this is for the best."
eeahr3,NAH- the kid is faking it. No way he has made it this far in school without some other kid spilling the beans or without figuring it out himself. Maybe he thinks it makes his parents happy or maybe he is just Holding onto that awesome part of being a kid. I’m voting NAH because you definitely wouldn’t be the first to burst his bubble and he needs to grow up eventually but I’d still leave it alone if it were me.
eeai2n,"NTA

You are an adult and can decide if you want to go or not. You told them what you wanted to do before they booked the trip. Give yourself 2 weeks to chill and work on issues."
eeaigo,"NTA, but I wouldn't send that text. 

Their timing and behaviors certainly warrant your feelings, but you've probably dodged a bullet in that these don't sound like responsible roommates. 

Instead, begin your search for a new roommate or look for an apartment for just you. Spend the time you'd have used to send the texts on finding new housing and making plans for your future. Chalk it up to learning curves."
eeakg0,"NTA. You set a boundary, reinforced it multiple times, made all necessary explanations, and they chose to cross it, even telling lies in order to be able to do that. That was their decision. 

The consequence is your continued anger. Right now, that's not appropriate for the holiday, so spend your Christmas however you wish.  Revisit the situation in March and see how you feel then. 

(Full disclosure, Christmas has been a non-holiday for me for several decades, so it doesn't have the emotional weight for me that it does for other people.)"
eeakos,NTA and your husband is an asshole. He should have never invited anyone without asking especially considering he isn’t helping
eealep,"NAH - as a general rule you dont give things that ""put someone to work"" but she was pretty clear to you so get it. BUT, also get her something pampering like a gift basket with lotions and bubble baths."
eean2b,NTA- he can’t jack up the price AFTER giving you the product. He needs to make the price clear before you make the exchange.
eeaoxk,"NTA.  You responded in a way that only those that were in on it understood.

However, your aunt is clearly mentally understable.  I would recommend not taunting her in the future, as the blowback may escalate, and innocents may be caught in the crossfire, as happened here."
eeap1n,"YTA (as is your teacher)

You don't know her financial situation. She may not have been able to come up with $40 to spend for a classmate. Your teacher is TA for setting such a price point for HS seniors.

A gift is a gift. Accept it with grace."
eeaskf,NTA. It's his money why the fuck should you pay it off for him? The bookie closed out did he?
eeaucy,"YTA...and a GIANT one. Why not offer to clean up the leaves for them everyday, since it's your tree dumping leaves in their yard? If you want the tree, YOU clean up the mess."
eeaum5,NTA but also real strange that you kept allowing her to hijack your plans so at some point this is a little bit your fault as well. Next time plan your own event and whoever can make it can make it and who can’t can do what they want.
eeavua,"NAH, I know you were trying to help her out, but after all the help you've given her, I think she wants to do something for you.  I'd say to let her do it."
eeaw60,Not the asshole
eeay64,"Since he keeps losing his jobs, he's a drain on the household so she has a right to know. Wait until after the holidays though, tip her off as you mentioned and let her piece it together on her own. If she doesn't act on it, don't followup. She might be in denial and that's her problem then."
eeaymf,"NTA. As an artist myself I completely understand the need for mild distraction when I'm working and your stepdad spoiled your flow. More importantly, he didn't turn off a service he sources and pays for solo, he turned off one \*you\* pay toward. In future he could turn off your brother's wifi or take his ethernet cable, or whole computer, or any other punishment that actually impacts on your brother and doesn't take your services away!"
eeb383,Lol no NTA you're entitled to your opinion and if she didn't like it she shouldn't have been listening to your private conversation.
eeb3wz,"YTA. Back her up, don't talk over her or for her."
eeb57n,NTA  the expectation to pay is just as big as the expectation to do the punishment. It’s only fair to demand that everyone has followed the rules if you are going to be punished.
eeb5rs,"NTA 

What you did was good. Don't let anyone tell you you can't kick her out because she's your mother. She also kicked you out despite you being her kid.

She disrespected your rules, didn't search for her own place and didn't work. 
Don't worry, OP."
eeb5y2,"Then do what you seem fit, maybe sit down with your roommate and discuss how you feel. maybe she can shed some light to her family over the situation, but regardless i would talk to your roommate first so it doesn’t seem like a curve ball"
eeb7n2,"NAH, but in future you should ask her first. They have a cap you put on them precisely so that you don't touch the urine-covered part. 

I just took pictures of mine and kept the pictures. But some people are really sentimental about it, especially the first. If you have more than one kid, I guarantee by number 2 you won't save 1/10 of what you keep with number 1."
eeb7vv,"Nah- Go without her and no need to feel guilty. Sounds like your brother has enough to pay for her vacation if she wants one. Can’t blame her for siding with her husband, but that doesn’t mean your relationship remains the same."
eebavp,"NTA.  She wants you around when she needs you, but it doesn’t sound like she wants to offer you the same support."
eebbd7,"Hero sucks to play against. My SO always picks him and I hate playing because he always whoops my ass. I won’t ban him from picking him because I’m not a child though. Your cousin sucks, but you also could just pick another character. ESH."
eebcvb,"Light YTA in that you could have come up with a better non truth, “sorry we have plans and can’t meet up”, it just happens those plans are chilling at home. Easier to defend when/if caught out I.e. “in this busy holiday season we needed down time, maybe when you visit town away from Xmas, we can catch up then”.

Alternatively, instead of hosting, meet them somewhere....."
eebh94,NTA.. your father is violent and abusive. Staying away seems like the best thing for your mental and physical health.
eebilp,"NAH, there is no commitments or rules here  only expectations which donr count. If you want to go with your friends them do it but let him know that it's not because of him its because you want to and you wouldve invited him if you thought he'd want to go.

TBH I'd probably ask you for more INFO since you've mentioned that you've had issues that you two are working through in the first 8 months. If there are issues then events such as these help show the true nature of the relationship as well as trust and caring."
eebkp8,YTA for bringing a stranger into her house while she slept.
eebn29,"Ahhh to be young again.

Yall need to work on your communication."
eebpzi,"NAH. Your mother is just disappointed but you’re making the call you need to make for your health, your wife’s health and your child’s health. Don’t feel bad about it"
eebvuy,NTA obviously. Your friend sounds jelaous.
eec04p,"YTA to yourself. You should get therapy for your insecurity and self worth because what you see, isn’t what other people see."
eec1lb,"NTA Calling Animal Control, leaving the door open so it can run off into the wilderness, or taking the dog to a pound while it’s visiting your house would make you an asshole. Asking to not have to deal with stepping in the shit of someone else’s untrained dog, pretty reasonable even for family."
eec3pl,"NTA

I don't know the legalities in Australia but at 17 in America your mother would still be responsible for keeping you clean and fed. She's trying to control you and that obviously makes her TA. Where you go to school will greatly impact your future trajectories so do what you want to do if there's a way for you to do it."
eec8ji,"NAH 

I think renovations are extremely hard on everyone. It has caused couples to divorce over it. I think that you need to sit him down and see if you can fix it, but  I think this might be the part where you both get off"
eeca31,NTA...I actually think telling someone they’ve gotten fatter is crueler than telling someone they’ve gotten gayer.
eeca8w,NAH. If someone else gets mad then they WBTA. You can tell the nurses to only allow in your husband and they’ll make sure of it
eecel7,"YTA 

That’s called doxxing my dude and I’m pretty sure it’s illegal."
eeceq5,"NTA. I knew a guy who used to do this, and he did it purposefully to mess with people and be an asshole. He liked to provoke people and lecture them. I suspect that's your friend's motive as well."
eecgb7,She said she didn’t want a cat. She obviously does though. I’d remind her it’s your cat and ask her tow stop the behaviors that bother you.
eech7g,"NAH.  I'm imagining I was your friend: you made me a purse! That's fucking awesome.  Please pack like 20 of your business cards inside so every time someone compliments me on it, I can give them a card and hopefully boost your business."
eech9i,NAH. Just tell her how you feel
eeck5b,"NTA.  Holidays can be bad enough normally, add an ongoing argument and it will be super sucky. Do you have friends you can do something with? Is there a local soup kitchen around you could go volunteer at and actually have people appreciate your presence?"
eecof0,"NAH, should I save the date?"
eecpmk,"NTA

I think your dad would want to know all of this, that your stepmother is emotionally abusing you like this. And you wouldn't be adding to their ""bumps and stress"", she is, but treating you this way.

And to expect a 7 year old child to be calling their father regularly, etc. is a little beyond the capabilities of a child that age. It's not like you had a cell you could use to call him.

Edited to add: and for stepmom to be bringing it up eight years later, bringing you to the point of tears? She's a real peach. \ sarcasm"
eecr3o,"NTA based just on this information, but damn I can't remember the last time I got to take a *two hour* nap, and I only have two kids. You have 3--I'm not sure how you manage it."
eecs3y,NTA - Telling you to board your dogs just two or three days before a peak holiday is NOT enough time for you to organize to do so.  Your family sounds like a lot to handle and as if it might not be the best use of your time and energy.  Can you have your parents visit later in the week?
eeculs,"Ugh.

Your sister is a shitty mom. Why can be such a frustrating phase because it goes on and on and on, but her solution is cruel and so inappropriate for the child’s age. 

I’ll go with NTA, but encouraging the questions right now is going to make things harder for your niece. Maybe offer empathy to your sister (who doesn’t deserve it but you want her to listen to you) about the frustrations and ask if at three she can really remember that rule well enough? Maybe she could write them down to ask you later, or have your niece call you to ask those questions?"
eecv2y,"Honestly I think it's because I am the only daughter. My brothers didn't pay rent because they didn't have jobs. I hadn't considered the closure aspect, so might rethink, but not really a fan of the idea right now tbh."
eecvkt,NTA you handled this very well- your sister sounds pretty crazy (sorry)
eecyj3,"NAH.  They tried.  You would have been better off asking them to pay a jeweler to repair your current chain AND it would have been way, way cheaper.  Just say that the pieces they got you were lovely and you'd love to wear them but the material doesn't work with your skin."
eed3tk,"YTA What the friend is like has no bearing on the fact that you puked in an Uber he called you. You owe him that money; you don’t get to use tasteless jokes to get out of that debt. You drank to excess, you threw up, you pay the bill."
eed3xn,"NTA

If you don't have the money to fly there now, you don't have the money. If they were offering to fly you out there on their dime as a gift  .... you still wouldn't be the AH if you didn't change your plans to get married, especially if the reasons you state are as solid as you say. Family is an incredibly important thing, but it's not the ONLY thing."
eed5eb,"Your intentions are in the right place, but you’re blatantly disrespecting her wishes, so this is a little tricky. Maybe if you laid it out for her: tell her that you realize it exceeds the maximum she set, but that you really want to support her in pursuing her passion. It should also be understood that you expect nothing in return, you especially don’t want her going out and getting you an expensive gift, and she can ask you to return the gift if it makes her too uncomfortable."
eed7cj,"NAH. Frankly I wouldn't do it myself, as it would make me very uncomfortable. With that said, if the supervisor says it's ok, and you're not expecting tips or making people feel bad if they don't tip, a reminder isn't a terrible thing.

Just make sure you're really subtle about it, otherwise you might offend."
eed9gm,NTA because I wouldn't want to get exposed to the Flu either.
eedag2,NTA - your vet says no.  Follow the expert’s advice.  End of discussion.
eedc4a,"NTA 

It's not really indirect... It's pretty direct. Still the asshole move here is exposing others to nasty smelling smoke."
eedc8u,"NAH- this seems to be a bit of an age AND race gap.  Have you talked to your wife about this?  Her racial perspective is different than yours.  This isn’t causing harm amongst his friends.  But like you said, you can ban certain words from your house.  Maybe instead of an outright ban it might be best to say that while the word has different meaning to him now, it is still a word that you are uncomfortable with him using in your home.  It’s out of respect that you ask him not to use it, not ignorance or anger and he should understand that."
eedfdl,"NTA - Your mother had you make over 60 cookies and three different desserts for her to gift to her friends and family (so, semi-professional or nicely finished desserts); and she doesn't think this warrants a thank you because you are related by blood?  Not okay."
eedhg8,"YTA because you unnecessarily started this whole thing. Wtf would be so hard about ordering a half cheese, half veggie? Were you planning on eating the whole thing? If you wouldn't have done that, your mom wouldn't have made her comment, and then it wouldn't have spiraled from there."
eedhsf,"YTA I am a queer hedonistic weirdo and this squicked *me* out. As a general rule, anyone who has changed your partner's diapers shouldn't be privy to what their genitals are doing as adults. You could have just told a white lie and said you squealed for another reason. Your boyfriend said his needs poorly, sure, but do you seriously think he is comfortable with his mom and girlfriend chatting alone about his ""performances""? Just lay off the lay talk. If for no other reason than to not inhibit your boyfriend's fetish. 

&#x200B;

>I gyrate in such a way as to tranquilize him and he finishes.

As someone who also has a vagina, I beg you to not say this kind of thing seriously. I am sure your vertical smile is charming as all hell, but this gave me secondhand embarrassment."
eediz5,"Nta, do what you feel comfortable with, don’t need to force a situation"
eedj74,"NTA. Not an asshole per se, but you've got to be joking if you think that's going to help you with rent. Honestly, giving him a small inexpensive gift on Christmas, and then giving him a ""pay up or pack up"" ultimatum a few days later would make more sense."
eedjjb,NTA. Save your money and run.
eedjz2,NTA I wonder if her car isn’t really hers? But either way you have no obligation to drive her
eedmvu,"NTA - but for clarity's sake, and if it helps you at all, it sounds like what your mom's boyfriend is talking about is a febrile convulsion, and those aren't a big deal. They happen when a child with a fever has a sudden spike in temperature, and the problem is that they're sick, not the febrile convulsion.

So the way you can help is to bring the kid food/paracetamol/water when they're ill (not if they have a febrile convulsion). You're well within your rights to avoid a trigger, and this trigger is not likely to occur."
eedo3d,"NAH! A gift is a gift. You can do what you want with it now. I recommend you show her your appreciation by doing a home-spa day and doing facemasks together, and then letting her know you can't use certain ones, and would she like to use them? That way she can feel your appreciation, and any that don't get used up should definitely go to that non-profit."
eedpmx,"Can I suggest making him a few small things (picture frames with something awesome of the two of you, ""Best Moments"" photo album, scrapbook of memories etc) and then putting them in boxes? It can even be a ""wishlist"" of things you want to try and do with him this year, and you can check them off together- whether its as simple as ""get ice cream"" or as lofty as ""take a vacation""."
eedr5b,"Soft YTA. This is up to you to let it go; he's trying to be accommodating, but nothing is good enough for you, it seems. The thing that would help this would be if you let go of your grudge, and I think holding a grudge over something so simple is what makes you the AH. 

But I can understand why you feel the way you do. I strongly recommend that you make your own plans, then head over when you're ready. Go for a massage, go skating, get food you love and eat it whole watching a favourite movie, whatever you would like to do. Make it something you will genuinely enjoy. Then don't worry about waiting to be invited. If you plan something that will take a little while, long enough for them to eat, just head over when you're ready. It sounds like having some control over the situation might really help."
eedra6,ESH. You shouldn’t have lied and they shouldn’t have abandoned you & screwed someone in your hotel unbeknownst to you.
eedv11,"NTA. Putting aside all of the controversial aspects of this post (which, frankly, feels a little like baiting)...you two aren’t close friends. I wouldn’t invite someone who wasn’t a close friend on a trip out of the country. It also sounds like you’d have to make lots of special accommodations to ensure this person’s safety and it doesn’t make a ton of sense to take that on if you aren’t close."
eedw2v,"A stranger in a bar expects you to hold her stuff while she hangs out with other people?  Yea, you're NTA."
eedwsr,"NTA. 

That's the same as asking someone to do something for you and paying in ""exposure"". Get that money."
eedx9x,"NTA. Your friend hit a parked car, this is entirely her fault in every way. It's amazing she actually has the audacity to ask you to pay for half of this."
eedxy0,"NTA, that's bad form. 

But holy shit I don't even spend $650 on my husband. Roll it back before you go in to debt."
eedyl2,"I was with you until the last sentence, YTA. The least you could do is tell him, and explain to him all of that why you don’t want to have a child right now. Horrific ending to that story."
eee051,NTA. Could you have said it nicer? Yes. But if someone told me I shouldn't hold a child that I carried for 9 months I'd be beyond offended and I don't blame you for snapping at him.
eee09z,"I actually disagree, I think it absolutely does obligate her to help. This is a moral judgement sub, in what world a sister that lives rent free for 5 years owns nothing to her sibling that provided her house with no strings attached?

If anything, I’d argue that morally the sister should offer some financial help to fix the roof, etc. If it’s like 2-3 months worth of rent I would feel like garbage not at least offering that to my sister who has been beyond generous to my family the past 5 years."
eee7ki,"YTA. 

Are you fucking serious rn? You're prioritising playing on your laptop then spending christmas with your family? Touchwood, but you never know what can happen in a year, this could be your last christmas together.

Get some board games, some alcohol and go have a fun interactive time with your family away from friggin technology.

Literally seems like a shitpost cause i can't believe someone would actually put tech over their own fucking mum."
eeeckf,"Huge NTA 

You potentially saved her thousands of dollars in legal fees, her job, her life... AND an innocent strangers life had she got into a wreck. Not to mention the company’s liability since it was a work holiday party."
eeecl7,"YTA - you took out your personal issues on her. It doesn't matter what she thinks of your class, if she hated teaching it, she hated teaching it. Obviously it's not the teaching side of things that was the problem because she's somewhere else now doing it. 

On top of that, the uniform issue had been dealt with by someone who (by the sounds of it?) is your superior. Should have left it at that for the time being and spoke to him later about it if you had issues. All sounds very unprofessional."
eeedbl,"I’m going against the crowd and saying NTA. Your dad had to realize inviting your brother and putting it so close to your birthday would deter you from coming. You need to do what’s best for you and if going there isn’t it, then that’s fine. It sounds like it would affect your mental health to go and that’s just not worth it."
eeefwy,"NTA, but you should break up with him now instead of waiting a year to do it.  Your bf has made it clear that he is not accepting of who you are and in a year he may be able to hide his intolerance better, but he will still be intolerant.

Why waste a year of your life humoring an asshole who throws a fit every time you mention who you are?  Leave now and find someone who can love you for you, instead of someone who is trying to force you to be something will never be."
eeehnn,NTA - If he said he wasn't going to pay for it he knew very well knew that it's his name on the bill. That's his responsibility. The thing you need to do is put a return to sender and put in your mailbox. Write does not live here.
eeehyl,"YTA, lol. You work 12 hour days and get 2 hours to relax? How fucking nice for you. Meanwhile she's handling all the home chores that do get done, parenting for two, being present for both of you FOR TWO MONTHS and you want more? 

How about some perspective? My fiance works 10-12 hour days, with at least an hour commute (each way) at least 9 months of the year. Doing hard physical labor. Somehow, he still manages to be a parent and partner and not use his only family time to ""relax"" until after the kid is in bed."
eeei09,"NTA, you are in a committed relationship and with a relationship comes compromises.  It sounds like your mom is either controlling or not ready for you to be in a committed relationship that requires taking turns."

eeekfk,"NAH - you have a right to be upset. If you would’ve acted on it though, and went off on her or yelled at her, you’d be the asshole. But you’re not an ass just for being upset with someone."
eeel0p,"If you're not her supervisor, do not say anything to her. At all! 

Go to your boss and talk to them. Tell them you think she needs a less demanding job because she can't physically do it anymore. Explain it coming from a concerned point of view rather than complaining. 

Tread lightly because people are super touchy about this sort of stuff."
eeelva,nta and honestly having a small yard is not a good enough reason to give away a dog.
eeelxn,"NTA, she needs psychiatric intervention"
eeemlk,"YTA.  Planner here.  I need this information to run any kind of analysis.  If you aren't interested don't waste people's time.  

You're probably in the wrong sub regardless though."
eeenvu,"Yta. This really wasn’t your fish to fry. Is it weird that she’s doing this? Of course. It’s also kind of sad and pathetic that she hasn’t moved on - but that’s on her and doesn’t at all effect your relationship. Leave it alone, stop looking at her social media, and if anyone brings it up to you, tell them you aren’t worried about it."
eeepwv,"NTA, but if you hate his family so much, why did you marry into it? Question- does he think this is ok?"
eeeqts,[deleted]
eeerqw,Yta. This is so far beyond none of your business it isn’t even funny. You sound jealous.
eeeuqe,"She way over reacted, but honestly her first answer sounds like “I really don’t want to be a bridezilla and say no, so I hope you take a hint and don’t.”  And what was she supposed to say once your hair is already bleached?  Pretty much hope that it works out for the best. 

Honestly, who drastically changes their hair 2 weeks before a wedding that they’re in. ESH, but you a bit more.  Your should’ve just waited until afterwards, you didn’t have to wait that long."
eeexk5,Yta. You were an asshole to solicitors for your own amusement. Not cool. And what does that have to do with your nephews financial situation?
eeexp9,YTA- you didn’t tell him you supported what he wanted.. you told him you don’t care about him. That’s pretty fucked up. He wanted to stick around to be there for you and you said you don’t care about him.
eeexub,"NTA at all. If you have any interest in knowing your younger brother, you could possibly offer to put $X in trust for him when he turns 18 contingent on your being able to bond and have a relationship with him. 

Otherwise this seems to me like your father knew he screwed you while he was alive and at least wanted you to know after he was gone that he at least thought about you enough to take care of you when he was gone. He had years to update his policies. He chose not to, either through neglect or intent. 

Your younger brother can collect in his social security until he turns 18, or 25 if he goes to college and grad school. He won’t be left with nothing. His wife can also claim survivorship on his social security, so she won’t be left with nothing. Since you have already graduated and are working, the insurance money is the only thing you will ever have from him in the way of support. Don’t give into her greed. Your father owes this to you for his abandonment."

eef6z5,"NAH.
But, keep in mind that fresh reconnections are finicky. It might be worth it to hit everyone this year and make it a long holiday to ensure that you keep those connections. Next year you can better plan what your holiday will look like and how to handle it."

The lemonade, kool aid and tea was either strawberry or had fresh strawberries chopped inside. Their jelly spread? Strawberry. Their fruit platters? Strawberry. Cakes/dessert? Strawberry.

It made me very uncomfortable at first. Then became upset, angry, bitter. That's when their evil genius plans backfired. I brought a crawfish meal to dinner, something his sister is allergic to. When they ""reminded me"" of her allergy, I told them

""I know, and we told the kids. So no hugs or kisses for nana or auntie until they're ready to be cleaned up!""

My husband also made our littles their favorite treats so that they wouldn't even be bothered with the devil fruit. We added nuts which his inlaws despise, so sadface... No treats for them either. They were pissed off but I bluntly reminded them I never acted insulted or pissed off, not even during the 3x I was sent to the hospital because of an allergic reaction at their house. They don't take my allergies into consideration after 12 years, all bets are off. (Which makes me the petty asshole, but it's fun so w/e)"

If that's the message you want to send, then by all means, you're not obligated to accept any gesture from her of any kind. If you'd like to get past where you are now and have something resembling a relationship again someday, probably want to just keep it, or give it to the kids or w/e, but not throw it back in her face."

eep5c2,NTA. Nobody gets to tell you what kind of gift you have to give. Your brother was appreciative and that’s all that matters.
eep5y0,"I’m going to go with NAH. Here’s my reasoning:

1. This is a yearly tradition that is very important to your wife. It’s not a weekly thing, and she’s expressed that it’s important to her. 

2. If the tradition is to eat and leave, then you can’t alter it without everyone being in agreement. 

3. From your perspective, this isn’t how a meal with family should go and seems wasteful. Fair point, from your culture. 

I’d ask your wife about the tradition and get more info on it. Every culture is different. What looks wasteful to you may be very important to them. Maybe host a family get together outside of the holidays to get to know the family."
eep6hd,"NTA but it won’t go how you hope.

If anything at all, I’d pull SM aside and tell her that you think she’s pretty fabulous and you appreciate how she’s welcomed you for the holiday. And maybe that you haven’t liked seeing how she has been treated and hope she is okay.

Your dad sounds like an asshole.  But until she is fed up enough to do something, she won’t. Has to be her choice. Just let her know that you enjoyed time with her: that would probably mean a lot. (I say this as a SM)"

alternatively, get your spouse to stand up for you.  stay near them, and have them counter-shush people that stop you from talking, and have them stop people from stealing your puzzles.  i think this is the ideal situation, because they've gotta be on your side for this sort of disrespect, and this is a valuable lesson for the in-laws."

I guess if you only see this as a short term relationship, keep it up, but if not she’s right to wonder why you’re treating her like a random Craigslist roommate."
eepxyi,">I love my wife and obviously dont want to upset her but I just dont know what to say here. Also something I should mention is that we seem to have these type of arguments pretty regularly even before the deaths of her family members.

Don't try to cut down. Just cut down. She's not ""having a go"" at you. Be a man dude.

Your wife is depressed because her dad and grandma died suddenly. Don't tell your wife to meet you somewhere. Go get your fucking wife.

>She continues to have a go at me while I am out with my friends telling me I always put myself before her and I am totally unsympathetic of her feelings.

My SO on the other hand? This guy expects that I unplug the wall charger for the iPhone when not in use. Lights are off unless you’re in the room even if you’re going back in two minutes.

In most situations going into someone's accounts makes you an ass but in this situation there was a clear violation and your finances were being affected.

You were well within your rights to open the account of the service you were paying for, though never agreed to pay for."
eeqgt7,"NAH. It seems as though you were asking because you assumed she made dinner for the whole family so why wouldn’t she set aside a dish for you. She wanted a day off, which she deserves, and didn’t voice that she would be making dinner for only herself that night. Since you did make yourself dinner it doesn’t seem that you’re lazy, you just thought that night would be like any other night. I deal with the same thing and to avoid no dinner/a fight, I always ask my mom if she plans on preparing anything that night and if not I have no problem making/getting something for myself."
eeqii7,"YTA and so is your fiance.  You can't dictate the type of gift you get.  Suggestions are just that - suggestions.  Quite frankly, I doubt your family will ever get your fiance another gift and I couldn't blame them if that's what they decide.  Your fiance to not take the gifts that were given to her is beyond rude.  She could have returned them.  She could have donated them to a worthy cause, like a womens' shelter.  You and your fiance need to get over yourselves."

eeqqod,"Sometimes this subreddit makes me really wonder about my judgement because I actually think NTA. This whole obsession our culture has that you either fill every moment with work or you are being lazy is unhealthy. Based on what you are saying about your grades it sounds like he is way off base about the college thing. You are right that most people (not even just kids) take it easy during the holiday break. You should be able to reward yourself with some relaxation if you have been doing what you are supposed to the whole rest of the time. I don’t think this makes you lazy, and I don’t think you are wrong to assert yourself. 


If you argued with undue rudeness you were wrong for that and I would lean everyone is the asshole, but I think your dad needs to chill out a bit. He sounds overbearing and if you are off to college soon he should really start giving you a bit more independence. 


All of that said do try to help out around the house. Your parents are not your servants, and you should help them if you are able and they actually need it and aren’t just giving you busy work."

Don't give him the gift you got for him.
Seems to me like he ensured you had bought something for him then started with the 'i can't afford it' gubbins.

If he has zero money available for non essentials then he could improvise eg  make a voucher pack, coupons for a foot rub, etc etc , costs him a few pieces of paper. Shows thoughtfulness.

But he worked quite hard to ensure you bought for him now didn't he? Don't reward that by actually handing it over! Get a refund."

As for his ""dogs"" comment, I think it's likely that he's repeating something he's heard at home - but again, he needs to be corrected when he says things like that. If the teacher is really saying ""leave him alone, he doesn't know what he's doing,"" that teacher is really doing a poor job.

Obviously your mom doesn't understand that part but you wouldn't be an asshole for informing her. If the pair you got is close to originals I would just rock them, but I don't know how good fakes from eBay are. If they are bad replicas I would just have the conversation with your mom and be appreciative of her gift but inform her the seller was being dishonest and passing off the product as originals when they are not authentic.

Growing your group is a good thing. Involving more women in the game is a great thing. But do it in a way that is not going to bring drama. You are 100% correct to think that this path will bring drama."

eev98h,"ESH - While you haven’t indicated whether the grandpa is too old to properly care for a dog, I don’t care - it’s being neglected with the grandpa and the dog *should not* go back to that home. If you let the dog go back there, you’d for sure be an asshole. 

My suggestion - animals have some rights. If you can prove that dog is being neglected, I am sure you can revoke grandpa’s ownership of the dog and send it to a rescue. Or, even better; have a shelter/rescue post this dog up for adoption and foster it in the meantime. From my experience at a shelter, small dogs go VERY fast, and if you take the time to potty train it, the dog will go in no time. 

However, I understand if you don’t want to foster her, and at the very least she needs to go to a humane rescue/shelter where they will possibly help potty train her. Sorry, but as a dog owner yourself, the “at least she’s not going to be left to die” attitude is quite shitty. 

I hope you do the right thing here. Is the dog your responsibility? No. You technically don’t have any duty to help this dog, but it doesn’t mean you wouldn’t be an asshole for it IMO. The fact of the matter is YOU and your GF are the only ones right now with the ability to help this dog, and I think you should try as much as you can."

eew4uj,"NTA - The key is that you pay rent. You are a tenant and should be given the same rights to privacy and not having your stuff messed with as any tenant. Unfortunately renting from family rarely  gives you the tenant rights you should have. Try talking to her. If that doesn’t work then move out. There are other places you can rent, and maybe losing that income will teach her to be more respectful. If she rents to non-family she won’t be able to get away with that."

eewcno,"NTA  The age when you are legally an adult is a big deal in most cultures. I’m not sure where you are from, but in the US, it’s common for parents to do the planning of a birthday party. So, it kind of pulls at my heart a little bit that you had to arrange your own celebration. I think it’s perfectly reasonable for you expect the adults in your life would act like fucking adults for 5 minutes and attend an event for you.

You told the school who keeps giving your kid lice. Good for you. You stopped the problem from continuing. 

She’s the asshole. She’s complaining because she failed to eliminate the lice and sent her kid to school to infect everyone else. Now she has to either get chemicals involved and fix the problem like you did, or take responsibility for her actions that now require her to care for and educate her own child during the day. It’s much easier to complain about the problem and play the victim than it is to fix the problem. You may want to remind the other parents about that. 

Keep taking care of your child. If the other parents want to be irresponsible victims of their own actions, that’s on them, not you."

You are okay with her posting until a relationship because it feels like she’s “yours” so she shouldn’t be seen by others, but she belongs only to herself. If you’re enjoying photos on the discord, personally I think it’s super gross that you’ll look at nudes but then have a problem with “your” gf posting them, like it’s only okay as long as they have your permission or something"

This woman put you in an uncomfortable position, sure, but you had every opportunity to bow out politely.  Your wording in this post speaks to a deeper discontentment than you’re letting on. You “informed” her that crying wouldn’t help? There is no sympathy in that statement. At the very least, this woman was having a very fucking bad day, and you responded by giving unsolicited criticism thinly veiled as advice. You responded by *laughing* at her. That’s downright malicious.

She certainly has no right to treat you poorly, but it sounds like she wasn’t treating *you* poorly. It sounds like she was at the end of her rope. I sure as hell would be if I’d lost my glasses on a train. This woman’s “bratty” behavior is more in line with someone who is panicked, frustrated, anxious, or even mentally ill. Yes, it’s a tough situation, but as you yourself stated, you were able to move to a different compartment and find assistance for her at any time, and you should have done that straightaway.

I see you warned him just three weeks ago - did he not drink within this time period? Either way, relapse is incredibly common for the first go around at sobriety. Even the first FEW times. So I do not want to call him an asshole for relapsing just yet. 

I do think you overreacted, and I honestly think you should apologize for the mean things you’ve said. However, I am ALSO not wanting to call you an asshole just yet, as I believe your anger is built up over years of resentment to his drunk behavior. It was an overreaction, but was most likely inevitable. 

So while I think you should apologize, the principle could still apply - you are at your wits end with his drinking and you clearly don’t have the capability of being patient for much longer. Let’s hope this is maybe a wake up call for him. But I encourage you to be supportive of him, in the meantime."

ef0zak,"NAH you are feeling like you should.  What she did was wrong, but coming from a good place.  I'm sure birthdays and such are very difficult for her.  Text your mom and tell her you love her.  Worry about setting boundaries another day, when both sides have cooled.  Make your friends lists private."
ef10vw,"NTA I think it’s ridiculous for people to assume people have to like the gifts they receive. FALSE! You must say THANK YOU for the gift, don’t have to like it. Especially when the giver is obviously thoughtless. 

I just went through a bad white elephant $20 limit adults only no gag gifts, and I opened a brick people toy set. I have no children or family here. It was the only non adult gift and totally inappropriate. I stated as much and loudly asked for someone to steal. Someone did and I ended up with the present I brought. Which I’d  rather have than the shit I was gifted. I will not participate next year. One persons thoughtlessness can ruin the game for multiple people."

ef1c2w,"NTA. I think you’re confusing the issue. Is it really the money he spent on himself, or that he spent zero effort on you? His excuse was the lack of cash. Now you know that’s not true. It simply wasn’t important enough to him to spend resources (time, money, creativity) on you. Ouch."
ef1epr,"I'm going by your comment to the other poster who requested more information.

I'd contact him directly and privately. I completely understand how hurt you are, but revenge may backfire and possibly outing him has consequences you don't want for either or both of you.

Contact him, tell him how he made you feel and ask him what changed his mind. If he's changed, maybe you get an apology and some resolve for yourself.

If he's being dismissive or mean, you can still consider outing him. I wouldn't tell him this beforehand though.

If you're outing him before having a private conversation, YWBTA People have the right to change, even from disgusting behavior like his. I completely understand the bad taste his post leaves in your mouth (always loving Muslims yadda yadda), but do have a private conversation first. Even just for your own peace of mind if you do out him later."
ef1gru,"YTA but only because personally I find it a little entitled to haggle over gifts. Be happy you got anything? Or don't, but don't complain.

If you'd have come here asking if it's cool if you sell the switch on ebay 2 months later I'd have probably given you an nta, but basically requesting a check for christmas and being disappointed by an expensive 'toy' to the point of calling your mom into your room and complaing to her is a bit much for me personally. It's christmas, but nobody owes you anything."

That's not how this works.  Being host doesn't mean bending over backwards to do everything the way other people who've hosted in the past did it or want it done.  It means you're host, and if people don't like your plans, they can make other arrangements.  If Dad's so desperate to cook prime rib for Cousin, tell him he can do it at *his* place."

As someone who has been in quite a few filthy houses before (hoarder houses or roach infested ones), I can tell you that it is a terrible feeling and there is nothing wrong with wanting to escape.

(You should definitely get more info next time though)"
ef2xcj,"YTA. So much. You’re an extra-asshole for not realizing that you’re an asshole. 

You talked about “how disgusting she was” and you have to ASK if you’re an asshole? Seriously?

Shaving underarm hair (and legs) is an arbitrary thing, and many cultures don’t do it at all. Plus, she wasn’t going to a formal or accepting the Nobel Prize... she was hanging out with family and it got hot. It’s the winter, and lots of women don’t shave during the winter. 

Even if you thought it was unappealing, you NEVER should have said anything. You owe her and your brother a major apology, and you should hope that they will accept it. If you were my mom and had insulted my wife in this manner and made her feel unwelcome at a family gathering, I’m not sure I would be in a forgiving mood anytime soon."

In order for the punishment to be effective at that age, it has to come directly after the action. If the kid was aware that you knew he had stolen the candy bar and you didn't immediately punish him, the punishment would have been less effective and the message would have been less clear that this is something bad.

In general, you should be making parenting decisions together. But part of being effective parents is trusting your partner to make effective parenting decisions when the other parent isn't around. It doesn't sound like your husband really gets that.

But, on the other hand--and while you're right that ""yelling"" isn't effective after the fact--you shouldn't be preventing your husband from talking to your kid about it. You handled it in the moment, but you both need to handle it from here on out."

I think this is an ESH.  but I don't have strong arguments against N.A.H, Y.T.A, or N.T.A.

to be clear, no one was really asshole-tier here.  but i do find both parties to be marginally wrong, which is what ""you're the ass"" means in this forum.

ef39ts,"NAH - it’s your house, you get to make the rules. 

However, you mention how you don’t want your kids to be exposed to this one day. I think by having such a negative relationship with alcohol, your children will too. Since alcohol is so controlled in America, there is literally a culture built around underage drinking. If you want your kids to have a healthy relationship with alcohol one day, you need to have one, too. Ultimately, once your kids become more independent they will find ways to do whatever they want. So, I would learn to have a healthy relationship with alcohol (which you can have without wanting to partake or to have it in your home), that way when your kids make the decision to drink or not, they also have a healthy relationship with it."

Don't ask her to tidy. Tell her. Say ' We are going to tidy your room now' and just get in with it cheerfully. If she knows it's always a fight this behaviour be will continue. If it's just a fact that you are tidying,there's no conflict, no drama and the job gets done."

ef4dv4,NTA - You have to be who you are going to be and parents should encourage that.
ef4l85,"YTA. I can only imagine how I would have felt in her position. When I trip, I also bring up that I'm tripping a lot. I do it for a few reasons. One, to explain to other people that if whatever I say/do next makes no sense, it's because I'm tripping. Two, because it's sometimes such an overwhelming experience that that's all I can say. And three, to remind myself that I'm just tripping. The latter is particularly important because when you forget that you've taken it, the trip gets particularly rough. Trust me, I've been there. She wasn't trying to brag.  


Obviously you have an issue with her using psychedelics in the first place and you don't care to understand them. I can't make you change that. But screaming at someone can ruin their night even if they're sober. You humiliated her. That's assholeish, and the fact that you disapprove of her using psychedelic drugs doesn't change that."
ef4lk3,NTA. She knew the times you took off ahead of time and planned stuff for you anyway. It is absolutely your right to choose what days you want to take off and what days you want to work. College is expensive and any money can help so go get that dough :)
ef4lxx,Yeah YTA if you bring the new guy without telling your ex that you've moved on. If you don't have any feelings for your ex you're just stringing him along by telling him that there's a possibility you two might get back together.
ef4ml5,YTA. You clearly have firsthand knowledge that would be beneficial for the court to know. You don’t have to “pick a side” and change your story to defend one side. You can go and tell the facts just like you did here. This is a ~soft~ YTA because I know there’s a misconception that you’ll be “showing your support” of who you witness for.

1) it’s such an inconsequential amount of money that it shouldn’t even have been a problem to begin with

3) if you want the stole for graduation in the fall, you should pay the dues for club membership in the fall

4) it’s a college club - not a highly regulated body with a multitude of governing laws and the president was just using their best judgement in the interest of the club

5) the time it took to make this post was longer than it would have taken to sort it out if you had acted like an adult and not nitpicked your clubs policies. 

6) a holder of an MBA should be able to analyze the costs and benefits of an action and determine whether that is an equitable use of their resources. You are not displaying the qualities of a good businessperson. 

7) you spent four years in this club and don’t care enough to give them such an inconsequential amount of money? You could even just consider it a donation. You seem so full of yourself and dismissive of this organization. Clubs aren’t just resume padders, dozens of people dedicate their time and resources to benefiting other students and the community but you’re going to put them on the run because you want to defend your technical high ground way past the point of acceptable limits.

But you disappointed her twice."
ef5rmd,NTA your mother isn’t going to catch the bug again and it sounds like your brother could use the support. You’re an adult and are perfectly capable of making this decision for yourself.
ef5shf,"Uh YTA this is so obvious cmon. There are plenty of ways to deal with this besides telling her she shouldn’t cook for “obvious” reasons. That is a true asshole move. If you have no interest in helping your wife improve what YOU think is bad food, then you will continue to be TA and an unsupportive husband. If you DO wanna be supportive and stop being TA, then give her tips when she cooks on how to make the food more to your liking. She is not your mom, she didn’t grow up cooking for YOU. If you want her to cook food you enjoy just work on that together. Or choose to have a wife who knows you hate her cooking. One of those is most definitely not a good way to continue your relationship. To reiterate though, YTA."
ef5ul5,"NAH.  Your feelings are totally valid.  You feel deceived and this is obviously a big shock to you.  But divorce can be a very complicated issue that significantly varies from marriage to marriage.  It tends to put a lot of strain on the children and I respect that your parents didn't want to involve you in that.  Edited to add:  I think one day you might also come to respect them for not putting you through it.  But until then, just try to adjust to the new normal and deal with your emotions in a healthy way."
ef5uma,NTA. It is incredibly inapproppriate for them to do so and it does people with service animals a huge disservice if the dog acts out.
ef5vct,"Obviously NTA. You didn’t agree to pay for anything more than Hulu. I’m amazed that they even asked you in the first place, are your parents worse off than you are?"
ef5xcx,"So, you're NTA. Wanting some privacy from a younger family member is totally reasonable.

But, you're probably not going to get your wish about your cousin not coming over any more. That question is likely way above your pay grade, while some of the stuff they've done is certainly inappropriate, there's nothing there which most family members are going to view as grounds for cutting him out of your life.

So, what you should do is this. Sit down with your parents at a time when he's not around, and when you're not emotional about it. Explain that it's frustrating when he follows you around all the time and that you need some adults to help make sure that he has other things to do than cling to you the whole day. That might work. 

The other thing to be mindful of: you and Jake are still kids. You're both going to find yourselves changing a lot over the next few years. It's entirely possible that by this time next year, he won't want to spend any time with you. So, if you ask for adults to help manage his behavior, and they tell you to get over it, it's possible it won't be a thing any more."
ef5zw8,"NTA

But throwing a fit isn't going to change anything.

I've got the same situation and nothing I've said has made a damn bit of difference.  

The good news is my kids are now teens and the grandparents are reaping the relationship they've sown.  My kids have only a superficial relationship with the grandparents who chose to prioritize other grandchildren over my kids.  And it's the grandparents who're really missing out.  My kids are nice, smart, and creative.  

Tell your Dad you're not holding off on opening presents or serving food.  If he wants to stop by later on Christmas Dsy, you'll be around, but you aren't altering your plans."
ef62fy,NTA. That's way too much to blow on gifts for two people. I spent $720 on gifts for 10 people.
ef648n,"NAH, you sound on the younger side. It's a tough situation for everyone involved. As much as it would be easier for you to not have her home, she is parents child and they will and should continue to care for her, and you.

Unfortunately in these situations , the child with the biggest problem takes up all the energy of the household. It is not fair to you, but the most vunerable child gets all the resources, I have experienced it from your side. It gets better with time."
ef68i9,"YWBTA - it sucks that your gift wasn’t as thoughtful as others, but hey man, $50 is $50. You’ll find that as you get older, getting a gift at all is a nice surprise. By the time you have your own kids, you’ll be lucky to get any."
ef6bax,NAH. I do have one suggestion. I would move the fuck away from a place where you have to work 80 hours. You may as well be dead.
ef6brs,"YTA. Both for lying to your ex-girlfriend, and for enabling her codependent behavior. 

Listen, you're either with her, or you're not. Rearranging Christmas plans at the last minute to go hang out with her is the action of someone who's with her. Dating someone else is the action of someone who's not.

You should not be rekindling a friendship. Not right now. She's clearly not over you, but you're over her. Allowing her to continue to hang onto hope (and dropping everything to drive a long way to see her is doing just that) only means that you're going to break her heart *again*. Don't do that shit.

You fucked up by cheating. That was an asshole move. You're fucking up further by not ending the relationship, but instead stringing her along. Stop it. Stop spending time with her, stop answering her texts. Let her know that this isn't healthy, that you need to end this relationship, that you're seeing someone else, and that you can't be her emotional support any more. Doing anything else just means that you continue to be the asshole."
ef6dni,"NTA.

I think he blew up because you weren't offering to do everything/host the party. i have found in my time cooking/setting up holiday stuff that everyone loves a holiday party and holiday food, as long as someone else is doing it.

everybody wants sausage pie, but nobody wants to MAKE sausage pie.

ef6fs1,"NTA. Forget dinner, I would be bailing on the whole relationship. That's super weird"
ef6grd,"YTA: you said it yourself

>This means that she often gets different foods from the rest on us, for better or worse.

This time it was better for her and worse for you...stop being a baby about it."
ef6h22,"Well, if she can’t be assuaged about your whereabouts due to her stalking you while shopping, you should cancel that ring buddy. 

NTA"
ef6i0b,"YTA.

Your kids went into her space and destroyed her expensive item. You are responsible for your kids."
ef6o5p,"YTA, or would be one. 

1. You didn’t tell her in advance you’re buying something and expect her to chip in. 

2. The drinks/snacks will be either consumed by everyone at the party, or you’ll keep the leftovers and consume them yourself later. Why would she pay for this?

3. If she’s so flaky and you’re so annoyed with her, stop enabling her. Don’t put her in a position where she can fuck you for money. Don’t lend her your car, ask people to Venmo you cash in advance and don’t buy stuff until you have it. 

This one is totally on you."
ef6rmt,NTA - explain to her she can receive her gift when she chooses to fix her attitude
ef6sou,"NTA, you were asleep! I get that he might have been disappointed and/or annoyed because he had expected something, BUT you had said that you were having a liedown and if he wanted to be sure he could have CALLED. So yeah, NTA."
ef6tym,"NTA. Drunk driving is dangerous and illegal, hell no to covering for him on that. He is putting other lives at risk and that is selfish and careless of him to do. He's a danger to himself and others."
ef6u7i,"NTA

She was rude for no reason to begin with, and then was also racist. She didn’t deserve a tip. I worked a server and now I always tip at least 20%. Sometimes more depending on the day. I loathe people who go into a place 30min to closing and also people who don’t tip lol but you were not in the wrong here."
ef6uo4,"NTA

If I had a $100,000 car I wouldn't let anyone I didn't know drive it either.
He could have rented a car, taken a bus or asked someone else for a ride."
ef6v98,"ESH. 

If they can’t be around each other one of them should bow out.

But girl, they got divorced 2 months ago, have some fucking tact."
ef6vtf,"NAH. If you don’t know the person well enough, no point in wasting money on something they might not use."
ef6yrl,"NTA. You're not obligated to donate blood. It's a really awesome thing to do, but you're not a bad person if you don't.

But if you WANT to donate blood and are just scared, I suggest you try it once just to get over the fear. Red Cross blood drives tend to have nurses who are REALLY good at what they do. And I find that the needle doesn't bother me if I look away while it's happening."
ef6zno,Your SIL flirts with your husband? Wtf? ROLL TIDE?
ef729s,"You should have told your boyfriend immediately that you arent feeling fine and what is up with you. Communication is key, and if you want him to be understanding of you and perhaps trying to help you, you have to be open about it. It all sounds like you really need a shoulder to lean on right now.

He may feel a bit left out if you tell him now, but better now than never. Tell him how you still struggle from the cut with your family and that you are just not ready yet to meet his. 

NAH. But understand if he is maybe a bit upset because you didnt tell him right away. It wouldnt be cool of him, but I guess you can see why that could happen. If you are feeling down/bad, talk to your partner. It can and will prevent a lot of misunderstandings.

I had to learn how to accept help in coping with loss/emotions, I always tried to do it on my own because I said to myself ""gotta keep strong"". But it really wears one down and it is not a weakness to reach out to someone. Just talking about it can be a relief most times, and it feels even better to have someone who hugs you and is there for you."
ef72t5,"Are you TA for having feelings? Oh honey, no. Feeling and dreams and wishes are normal. Your dad and his family are and will (hopefully) regret the consequences of being TA because you limit the exposure of your new family to their negativity"
ef773b,"NAH This is super common!  Girls do this ALL. THE. TIME.  So long as it wasn't a conversation revealing something very personal that you asked to keep private I don't see her sharing the screenshots making her an asshole, but you are also entitled draw your boundary lines where you feel most comfortable."
ef77tl,NTA if you are polite about it and if they are particularly loud - you mention the fact you didn't mind with your previous neighbours. It could be that they have young children who need to be explained not to run indoors; or maybe that there is a time they can play loudly and a time to be quieter.
ef786b,"NTA. You chose to forgo a few thousand dollar purchases and invest it to save up for a Tesla. She doesn’t get to reap the rewards of your investments as she had the opportunity to do the same. This arrangement means that your 5% is yours, not hers."
ef79jm,"NTA, you didn’t ruin your mom’s marriage, he did it himself. I’m a firm believer that if you’re marrying someone, you’re marrying their family as well. If you care about your so enough, you should at least make an effort."
ef7bmx,YTA it doesn't matter if that's your sibling. That's not your home. That is such an invasion of space and privacy.
ef7bsd,"NTA You went and paid her adoption fee, she's yours🤷🏻‍♀️"
ef7cix,"NTA all this is just a big no in a relationship, and a massive red flag. He definitely should not be going to bars until 5am with another woman alone and not tell you."
ef7d2v,"NTA.

It is fair enough to ask your grandmother not to facilitate your aunt being petty towards you and your kids."
ef7fj5,NTA - but just tell them.
ef7goe,"YTA.

Here's the thing. Your account is 5 days old with only 2 posts, both in AITA but with wildly differing stories and backgrounds. You claim to be from Estonia, and your first post tries to support that, with broken English. However, the broken English is VERY selective and is clearly forced. This current post is FILLED with missing information and plot holes, and you refuse to respond to anyone asking for more info except one or two super defensive remarks. This exhibits ALL of the textbook indicators of a troll account. Trolling for goodwill and sympathy on Reddit during Christmas because you know others will be less likely to scrutinize your posts too closely makes you a MAJOR asshole. 

Dont feed the troll, guys. You are all smarter than this. Yeah, its Christmas. And? That makes it even MORE important that we use our heads and dont just fall for every heartfelt plea that we stumble across. People are assholes. They will literally sell their soul for attention on Reddit."
ef7i74,"NTA Your Aunt doesn’t seem to have any compassion for your condition, just take care of yourself."
ef7jn0,NTA. Not immature at all. How hard is it really for them to wait a few extra hours? It’s understandable that they open presents in the morning as a tradition but it might be worth them waiting for their son until the afternoon. The fact that you’ve told them multiple times about how much it would mean to you if they just waited and included you in the celebrations and they still refuse to wait puts them in the wrong. They’re not worth your time if they’re going to act this way. Spend Christmas with people who respect your feelings instead. I hope you have a good holiday season regardless.
ef7khj,NTA heaps of people don't do Santa.
ef7p90,"I would also go with option 1. As shitty as this may sound, his health issues are not your problem at this point. Also, consider that your tenant might have been trying to hide the brain tumor stuff behind other excuses while they desperately scramble the money to pay. Doctors may not be cheap over there. Or they could be lying and is delaying payments because they simply do not have the money together for another reason (unlikely)."
ef7qqy,"NTA. You came back to spend time with her and make her happy, but now she is causing you to be miserable. I don’t think it is unreasonable to leave early when your daughter is prioritising the SIL who works a lot over her Mother who flew back just for her. Go back to your husband and make the most of the rest of the holiday! As a 24 year old who lost her Mother to cancer last year, it hurts to know that there are people who don’t seem to appreciate their parents..."
ef7qw2,"It would be lowering to their level.  Just let this be the last Christmas you invest your time and money into gifts for them. YWBTA, accusing someone of a lousy gift really never goes over well."
ef7sem,"NTA. Your mother is the worst type of Christian who hides behind her religion as an excuse to judge others. If my kid is happy, I’m happy. If your mom can’t do that for you, you don’t owe her your time. Period."
ef7vxu,"NTA , she she has to live with that. not ur problem"
ef7wzy,"NTA

I do the same to my girlfriend whom I taught to drive.  She used to get a bit upset at me about it when it was frequent but now shes a great driver so I rarely, if ever have to.

He needs to grow up and learn how to take constructive criticism.  Especially when it comes to driving, as its extremely dangerous and a very serious matter."
ef80r0,"My main issue is that I am unable to return mine. Otherwise I might be okay with doing that. I'm not gonna lie though, I definitely take a bit of offense to her gifting something that my daughter has REALLY been wanting without checking with me. Maybe that makes me a little bit of an asshole in itself, but I feel I've kind of earned being able to give that to her."

ef81uc,"NTA. People use family as a way to guilt each other into dealing with people who are constantly shitty to them. Not to be crass, but...just bc some people you know took a load and then raised that load to be a rude adult doesn’t mean you have to be around them. The older I get the more I think people like your mom (and a lot of people I know who share her views) are just mad as hell that it never occurred to them that they don’t owe family anything."
ef821a,"NAH, just talk to your sister and ask her if she and her daughter would like to go on the holiday. Or could you ask if you can take Niece with you and your family? It's a tough one because she has chosen to stay with Travis."
ef82es,I don’t think you’re going to spoil his big day seeing as it’s a month or two out depending how far in February it is. NTA
ef83sn,NTA she's abusive and terrible
ef84qg,"NTA- Bye, Ianlicia.  That’s creepy he’s demanding you enable tracking and then he brings up cheating to gas light you into it. Keep location turned off and find a new boyfriend."
ef855e,Info: what does your son want?
ef867s,NTA because you gave him the option to either stay and be grounded or to take his chances out in the world.
ef8dsl,Your brother and SIL think you are being selfish?!!  After not allowing him in their house and only putting one grand when you put up six!  Definitely NTA
ef8en5,"YTA.  The cashier wasn't rude, she just didn't have a poker face.  The frustration you saw on her face was the frustration all the 27 people in line behind you felt.  Your mom may be a sweet lady, but it's beyond exasperating to stand behind someone who is told the total and just then starts to fumble around to get out her money, card or God forbid check book.

Your mom has been to Costco before, right?  She knows the entire time she's standing there while her items are being rung up that she'll need to pay - that is the time to get her payment ready.  Not after it's all done.  If she doesn't get this,  help her.  For the sake of everybody.

Downvote all you want peeps, but from someone who lives in an area with a huge number of retirees who view shopping as their only social outing or seem surprised every single time when they need to pay, I'm just done.  They can all be sweet as pie, but I don't care.  I'm just tired and ready to get my stuff and go."
ef8eys,"Nta

You didnt do anything wrong, it is not her position to deny you more food."
ef8f81,NTA. You told a group of friends the reality of your life. If you can’t tell your friends your gram died who can you tell?
ef8ffn,"YTA

Because the only person your actions impacted is your wife, and she didn’t do anything wrong."
ef8hkt,YTA. An eye for an eye doesn't make your behaviour not asshole behaviour. You stopped to his level and hundreds of innocent people suffered.
ef8i54,"Light YTA. You meant well, but if you both agreed to not get gifts, I can see why that would make him upset."
ef8k59,"YTA. As much as I sympathize with how the situation made you uncomfortable, the whole problem could have been resolved quickly and quietly if you had just communicated with him and let him know that you have issues blending your work and personal lives together. He may have not even known that this was socially unacceptable. From what I’m reading, it doesn’t look like he persisted after you explicitly said no, it seems like you just said “not today” or something else that didn’t specifically address that you aren’t just not interested today, but you’ll never be interested, even if the reason for that isn’t his fault. 

I hope nothing bad happened to him and if I were you I would try to ensure that no one disciplines him for this."
ef8m1c,"ESH you should both sit down and have a serious talk about this - make it clear what drove you to call her that, apologise (and ask for an apology). Talk it out so this doesn't happen again."
ef8mgn,"NTA. GF didn’t respect your clearly defined and previously agreed upon plan of action. Then to ask you to help her with something that doesn’t really require 2 people (doing laundry for 2 people) when you’re trying to make it to the place you agreed to being at at a certain time to see your grandparents who are leaving town. Def NTA


Your GF however seems very selfish and entitled and not caring about your family or your wishes. 

She is def THE A**HOLE"
ef8mm5,NTA - You warned them twice and they still did it. They put you in a really stressful situation. They should know you better and know you wouldn’t be okay with it.
ef8pr0,NTA keep your baby away from your parents. Your mom tried to KILL HERSELF bc she didn’t agree with you. Cut them off. Seriously. They are so dangerous to you and your baby.
ef8qux,NTA sounds like Jim has been getting away with this crap for years
ef8reo,ESH - If you had such specific requirements for your headphones you should’ve told them early. Hell... find headphones you want and ask them for those specific ones. But they should be more understanding of your reasoning
ef8thh,"NTA - you’ve already talked to her about it and she didn’t listen, even if she’s just trying to be protective"
ef8vvw,[deleted]
ef8yfp,"I'm torn between NAH and ESH. Reading your mail is intrusive since you're an adult, but you're acting in ways that are a bit immature so they're treating you like a child. Maybe take all dishes out of room on your own and keep on top of your loans, then (eventually) they'll stay out of your room and treat you more like an adult.    
  
Honestly though, the best way to solve this problem is to move out."
ef8ylp,"NTA - When people approach you with ""she still has feelings for you,"" SHUT. THEM. DOWN. Stand up for your friend and tell them what she would tell them. You are just friends and end it at that. Her moving on isn't on you, it's something she has to do."
ef8zze,"NTA....I repeat NOT THE ASSHOLE.  You are old enough to make your own decisions and you certainly do not have to continue to participate in the farce that is religion.  

To be fair, you are me 10 years ago, so I may be biased.  But own who you are and don't be ashamed of not believing in the man in the sky."
ef92mu,NTA. Your dad needs some training.
ef94c6,"YTA.  If you had an issue, you should have spoke with her mother before saying anything to her."
ef969m,"YTA just because this isn’t going to go good for you. I can’t warn you enough to stop what you’re doing and get rid of this idea like yesterday. 

Delete this post delete the throw away account. Red fucking alert you’re about to commit relationship suicide"
ef96jb,Should you switch people every year for secret santa? It’s not a secret if you have the same people every year
ef97ib,NTA he didn’t even tell you about the wedding you got 2nd hand info from mom.
ef9aok,NTA but you need to move out or find a new roommate.
ef9bar,"I wouldn’t say you’re TA, but it seems like a minor thing to end a friendship over (especially since she paid you back). She probably didn’t realize leaving the door unlocked bothered you as much as it did - from the post it sounds like you just threw in a “Did you find your key?” once in a while.  

This just sounds like a friendship that ran its course and if it hadn’t been the key it would’ve been something else."
ef9cgw,"NTA.  If he wants to see you, he can always visit you for a short period of time and then leave."
ef9ef8,"YTA. If you cannot afford to tip service workers for their services, do not use their services."
ef9g9j,"NTA. Reading the title I thought you would be, but its pretty thoughtless to give someone a luxury they have no desire to use when the same amount of money could have given them a dozen things which will make their day better."
ef9jv2,"NTA. That's weird. 

Also, it may be normal in his extended family, but you're his immediate family now so if it's weird in ""your"" family then it's weird. He needs some boundaries."
ef9kpp,[deleted]
ef9lxi,YWBTA.  He’s 8. A few more years and he’ll barely want to acknowledge your existence. Appreciate the time you have with him. And I say that as a new stepmom of an almost 7 year old who is obsessed with all things Pokémon and Minecraft. Do I wish he would stop talking about them?  Of course I do. But instead I try to be as engaged as possible in the conversations.
ef9r9p,[deleted]
ef9t4h,"NTA at all. Oh my god. If my SO left me alone on Christmas I would be devastated. I’m so sorry that you’ve been having to deal with that, just know you don’t deserve that at all. Your SO is being a huge AH. Happy holidays to you, I hope you’ll still be able to enjoy the season :)"
ef9twr,NTA - In most states that's straight up illegal. Your safety (and others on the road) is paramount.
ef9ud7,"God, are you a family of children? This hurt my brain reading. ESH."
ef9v09,"NTA. But seriously, what's up with mom's obsession with this stuff? Mine is quite similar and will talk about homicides and women drowning babies and other kinda dark stuff she saw on the news."
ef9xmv,[deleted]
ef9y92,"NTA - she was an asshole, said terrible things about others you care about, told you not to come and never apologised. Honestly, why WOULD you go?"
ef9zqk,"NTA. If they didn’t trust you to cook, they shouldn’t have put the responsibility for the meal on you. This is ridiculously patronizing behavior."
efa1wj,"NTA. She's playing power games, OP, and the best way to win is to stop playing. Get your wife to deal with it. It's her mother we're talking about here."
efa2c0,YTA how would you even think that was appropriate? You literally insulted her and then got mad that she got offended. That’s not “potty humor” that’s being and asshole.
efa2zl,"NTA.  the BIGGEST NTA I’ve ever seen. You’d only be the asshole if you DIDN’T say anything.  She sounds awful for so many reasons.  Just a truly difficult and entitled person. I actually got angry reading you post.  Someone has to speak up and not let this awful person come in and dictate how YOUR family should do things. Open presents, eat meat, have fun. Sorry about your situation."
efa3yo,"ESH you're upset because of a game and because he made meatballs wrong? It may be a tradition, which no one likes changing but to say he ruined Xmas eve is a bit harsh"
efa4u4,"NTA.  You were helping them out and doing a favor.  Instead of treating you well for your generosity, she bitched at you.  You were fed up at being treated like this for a long time and tonight was the final straw.  She owes you an apology, but I doubt you get it."
efa77w,Hi i’m rese and if also like to contribute (My name is actually Emma) Snow is fully aware of my feelings towards Green and i am aware that he does not feel the same and i’m fine with that. The issues here is that Snow is hurting Green which is hurting all of us because we do not want to see him hurt. The only person not getting hurt in this situation is Snow. So no i don’t think OP is the Asshole. And the “all i have to do is sit here and like pretty” was a comment made towards me after Green said something to Another friend about liking her. So yes she is fully aware and abusing her “Power” and it’s not okay. Sorry that i’m biased.
efa79y,"NTA - That is a ridiculously aggressive way to inform somebody that you have cake for them.

Man... I never thought I'd write that sentence."
efa7ko,ESH.  The kids were jumping off the roof and this is what you are upset about?
efa9l6,Don't give her anything and kick her out of your house.  Is there an option for not enough of an ah?  NTA
efa9o5,"YTA because you're insecure and unable to be humble, while she is showing patience and helping you grow."
efacwh,NTA.  Move out and enjoy life on your own.  You deserve it!
efafry,"NAH - she’s finding herself at uni and doing all kinds of experimenting, and you’re not. She’s allowed to change and you’re allowed to change your feelings about her."
efajm4,NTA! Your mom should pay for boarding like you have done for your pets.
efakbn,NTA especially because she is playing music on her phone. Anyone who does this is automatically the asshole.
efamdk,No judgement; this is not about the mess..
efao0p,"This sounds like the straw that broke the Camel's back. 

NTA. Sometimes, you are the only one that sees a different side of a person. It was like that with my step-dad and I while I was growing up so I completely understand."
efar69,ESH - Breaking down in the car because you had to leave a party early and leaving your husband mystified as to why you're having an episode the entire ride home is ridiculous. Your husband is being incredibly dramatic by saying you ruined Christmas.
efas93,"You're not just TA, you're a dumbass too for saying that you didn't invite him. You're putting the host Jason on the spot AND making your colleague feel like a damn fool when he can clearly see in the chat that this wasn't cleared with Jason. Grow the fuck up and accept responsibility for your complete stupidity and apologise to EVERYONE, especially Jason and colleague."
efauns,"I’m struggling to see why you didn’t just tell him your cat licked it when he first grabbed it. Both of you need to grow up.

efavmb,"YTA- smile and nod, it’s like the biggest holiday rule."
efavz9,NTA you don’t owe them anything and leaving to go see them would cost you a lot
efawmf,"Yikes.  YTA.  I hope you remember this when you’re old and looking forward to those rare moments when you get to see your beloved family and grandkids at Christmas.  The issue is not whether your parents know how you feel about your grandmother, it’s more like do they realize what a selfish kid they raised?"
efax9o,"YTA- yes, you did VERY MUCH over-react."
efay72,"NAH but you’re probably gonna need to spill the beans if you don’t want them to think you’re an asshole.

Your mental health is more important than making enough money to buy big gifts - your family should know that."
efb212,"A very gentle YTA

i emotionally cheated on my ex and the situation was a LOT like this. None of my friends said anything, some expressed some concern and others straight up acted like it was completely acceptable / validated me

In turn i thought what I was doing was normal & didn’t count as “really cheating”. I had been in the relationship for 16 months before the cheating started. I didn’t understand the extent of what i was going and was trying to rationalize that what i did was acceptable.

Trying to keep this short, i was totally falling in love with this guy and telling myself i wasn’t. The relationship with my ex ended in an ugly way. 
Looking back i wish someone had intervened earlier, and gotten my ex out of our relationship. I regret it all so much. I was such an idiot.

I’m not saying your friend and myself are the same person.

But you will be saving him and his girlfriend a lot more heart ache if you say something now.
Good luck dude."
efb32q,"If they speak English then yeah, it's a little inconsiderate.

They could include you in the conversation, but they don't, that's a choice aside from language."
efb3a4,"NTA, she need to respect that it's your child, and as the parents, you have the right to say no, for whatever reason.  if she cant accept that, then she cannot be with the child.

this has to be a my way or the highway kind of deal."
efb6w0,"NTA. 

Definitely a first world problem, but your feelings are valid. Unfortunately the way the gifts were distributed makes you feel “less than.”"
efb70s,"NTA - If I'm reading this right, you texted 5 times asking for a specific time or if you could come now. Sorry, but expecting you to walk in the rain with an expensive camera and forego all your other plans to do this FOR FREE makes them the assholes in this scenario."
efbbfn,"ESH I'm going against the grain here, but man, did you think much about your gift?

He's well-off Asian - should have tipped you off that it would be much better to buy in regards to his interests, rather than ""what he would find useful"". Did you really think that he needed his own rice cooker? 

Secondly, he likes cooking. A cookbook would have been great. Books in general, are amazing and easy. Not to mention if he's in the friend group, why didn't you cater to any of the easier interests? 

Thirdly, if you don't have the minimum spend to enter into a group secret Santa, don't do it. Or save up a little more beforehand. 

Fourthly, most of the people commenting that a rice cooker is a great gift are not in high school. As someone who lives alone, 10/10 would have loved the rice cooker.

But that's serious crazy on behalf of his parents and his reaction is shitty."

efbejf,"NTA, you are looking out for your brother. You WBTA if you had known and didn't tell him."
efbhoa,"NTA. Who the heck thinks they're entitled to try on someone else's clothes without even asking them anytime, anywhere, for any reason? I wouldn't even go in my *mom's* closet to try on her clothes without asking first (now that we're both adults and live separately - as a teen living at home her closet was fair game). That is rude as hell. Not only that, but she damaged at least one of the items and made a mess by leaving the clothes and the hangers strewn around. ""Support"" does not mean ""Letting someone you barely know have free reign to do whatever the hell they want to do no matter how many boundaries it crosses."""
efbisr,NTA. It sounds like she just misses her family and is sad and was redirecting her frustration on to you.
efbj2q,"You’re not an asshole, just... *weird*"
efbkmn,"NTA if you do this, but I think there might be better ways to approach this issue. Maybe explain that you are upset and what you are upset about directly? A letter strikes me as a bit passive aggressive and like it will cause issues."
efbl5u,"NAH. She was gone for 90 mins and chilled with her friend a little bit- no big deal. If you were waiting on her for something, or if she was gone for 5 hours and didn’t respond to texts, or came home drunk as a skunk, then she’d be TA. 

Each of you deserve to enjoy a little time away from raising triplets. Let her have her hour and a half, and you can have yours too when you want it."
efbm28,NTA and kudos for standing up for your sister.
efbm53,"YTA. And, *Ewww…*"
efbm5o,"NTA - Do what makes you happy, the same as they are obviously doing. Alternatively, you could suggest things you could do as a group that you can all enjoy."
efbmsw,[deleted]
efbyob,NTA. Wisdom teeth removal isn't like getting a shot. It's still surgery and recovery takes way more than a few days.
efbzhs,"NTA.

I’m thinking your wife might be much more sensitive to clutter/mess than you, which is fine. But if she’s truly doing up all the chores before you have a chance to address them, then complaining to family that you don’t do chores, that is absolutely unfair. I’d ask her what she’s expecting from this situation because I would also be confused and hurt if I were you."
efc1t5,"Nta. He shouldn't have even needed to be asked. When you damage something, you pay to repair/replace it. However you can probably solve this by renting a steam cleaner vs getting new furniture."
efc1z1,"NTA. He wants  you to be a SAHM? That is fine, if he can support it with $$$ and if you want to be a SAHM. If he can't or won't get a job that pays enough, it is not a viable idea. You need to protect yourself and your child. Being a SAHM is a major risk as re-entering the job market can be tough."
efc308,"NTA
Very clearly you are not in the wrong. In fact, your mom’s the asshole. I work at a school and I shit you not when I say the janitors are some of the SWEETEST people I’ve ever met."
efc35r,"NTA.

She's right. It's her relationship. But it's all y'alls space.

But you have a right to not be grossed out, and you CERTAINLY have a right to take exception to inappropriate behavior around your son. She's being creepy and weird, and you shouldn't feel bad calling it what it is."
efc3pl,"NTA. I'm half Greek on my dad's side and he does the same thing for my name day. Even worse is that I'm trans and when I changed my name he told me I ""wasn't allowed"" to pick something other than my baptismal name. But your life is your own, and it's your choice whether you want to celebrate your name day or take part in any other traditions. You don't need to compromise your beliefs in order to appease your family. Καλά Χριστούγεννα (if you celebrate it)."
efc40a,Suck it up butter-cup. Merry Christmas!!!
efc4ko,YTA for hating Tex mex
efc5il,"YTA. You're acting like a child. You expect him to wait until you go to bed to put presents under the tree? He's trying to give your kid that magic you had growing up. You've had the experience. It's not your turn to be the kid, it's your turn to be the adult that makes the magic happen for your kids. Just like your parents did for you all those years."
efc5yy,"YTA.  Sort of.  In this situation, it sounds like more of an incompatibility; your standards for cleanliness are higher than theirs. It sounds like they tried to address the issue by hiring a cleaner, but it's not how you want to live. So I would say your options are to be the one who cleans (maybe ask if they would pay you instead of the cleaner?), but forego nagging them, you can give up and give in to their standards, or you can find new roommates whose living conditions are more in line with yours."
efc6fe,NTA and I hope that you find someone who makes you feel more loved and valued than this person does.
efc7nq,"YTA, and if it validates my opinion for you in any way, I am an atheist liberal.

You are unnecessarily being a prick. When someone says ""I'm going to pray for you"", it is a way of saying that they really want you to get better and care about you, and you are going to respond by essentially telling them to fuck off?

People like you are why a large portion of society views liberals as a bunch of assholes up on their high horses"
efc9ut,"YTA. don't act like you're going to be there if you're not, especially 5 years in a fucking row"
efcblg,"YTA, only slightly though. His father didn't want him to do it and he said that. Plus he's not of legal age. Personally I don't think it's a big deal but it's still not the right thing to do."
efcc8u,"Fuck that. Your mom, Sarah, and your sister are all assholes. The NERVE of her, to show up at your mom's house! I'm pissed off just reading this!

I don't understand why your mother is so invested in Sarah. Why would you want to tell her Sarah cheated on you, after how your sister acted? What a fucking mess!

Not gonna lie, you kicking out the screen and taking off through the window is straight savage. Reflexes up on legendary.

NTA

Thank you very much for the awards, kind strangers! My first platinum! And 3 silvers! I'm very grateful! Wow! Thank you!"
efcciw,NTA. This guy sounds insufferable. Civil avoidance seems to be the best tactic you can use here.
efce1m,"
huge red flag, beak up with your sister immediately"
efcgez,"NTA. But, can you let them come for an hour and just visit/not feed them? Or just have light snacks?"
efcmxr,NTA. That was just flat out rude. But maybe something was overlooked. I would ask privately about it or have your mom ask for you.
efcnd5,"INFO

Why does he hate your family so much???"
efcryc,"NTA. Your poor brother! Personally, I would pull her aside and do it privately, to try and be the better person. But you should definitely speak up. And maybe be extra nice to your brother to try and bring his self esteem back up. I have hormonal issues that have caused me to have more acne when I’ve never had problems with it before, and it sucks when people point it out or bug me about it. Like, I know I have acne. I do take care of my skin and use acne medication. But I still have acne. And if someone tried to do that to me, I would let them know it was inappropriate."
efcww3,"> She has well over $2k in the bank that is doing nothing

It's not doing nothing, it's being saved. It's smart to treat savings as non-expendable money.

That said, NTA. Her gift was not thoughtful at all. I do not agree whatsoever with people who say ""just be grateful for whatever you get"" when someone clearly didn't give an ounce of thought to the gift. She got him Rick and Morty PJs and he *doesn't watch Rick and Morty*. Who does that? You gave her a thoughtful gift and the price tag is irrelevant, you actually put time and effort into finding stuff that would be special for her."
efcz9y,NAH. But I think you should really think about what you're gonna say because there are so many different ways this could go wrong if you don't communicate your feelings properly. Your parents will only think you're ungrateful if you don't make them feel really appreciated for trying to get you a gift. I recommend starting with a word on how lucky you are to have them and stuff and then tell them the issue.
efdbcd,NTA it is okay to want to sleep in your own bed in your own house and have access to all your things to get ready for the big day and to socialise when you feel like it. That’s why we get our own apartments so we can do this.
efdcvn,"NTA but have you actually told him to stop sending them?  Be blunt.  They'll him to stop or you are blocking him.  You friends say you need to respect his beliefs...but unless you are trashing Christian morality, then it is he whom is not doing so."
efdem3,"NTA. 

She’s not a close friend. She’s not even a friend. She’s using you.  Why you resumed communication with her is beyond me. You have better things to do."
efdknm,"NTA- but he has a point, you are sexualising a normal habit but she seems ok with it so there is no need to get all righteous about it"
efdlma,"Yikes. I have the same problem. I ended up not making a huge deal out of other people's birthdays because I'm usually disappointed myself when people don't even acknowledge it.

NTA."
efdmb4,"NTA, you are not responsible to give gifts every year for any reason you choose. Although I do think that you should maybe share how you're feeling this way to one of your closet family members and see how they react to you feeling underappreciated."
efdmyj,"So, let's recap.  You lied to your girlfriend about what you want.  Your girlfriend trusted you, and took you at your word.  You are now upset with your girlfriend for believing (I'm kind of with you on this point, she shouldn't believe a word out of your mouth.) what you told her, and acting accordingly.

Survey says, YTA."
efdnkd,"Your aunt and grandmother are right, NTA. 

Sorry to say this but your mom sounds not only insensitive but dense."
efdrwy,"NAH. Sounds like a legit miscommunication! Just make it up to him.

Don't be surprised if you get a wooden letter J for your birthday though ;-)"
efdryq,"NTA I mean you could’ve tried harder to wake her, but your mind was in the right place for your son. Keeping the Christmas magic is important!"
efdt4d,"NTA 


You’re not obligated to listen to anyone. However, by not listening to others you may find you have no one to listen to you."
efe20o,"Esh - he might be a controlling dicktwat but you should've taking this up to her instead of throwing her under the bus by telling him you chilled after he told her not to.

You weren't just insulting him or throwing shade to make him mad (that wouldve been fine), you ratted our your friend while you had no idea about (and didn't even think about) the consequences it could have. This guy (according to you) is major controlling and flames people in her life out of nowhere just for being in it. these are two big red flags and it could've really turned out to your friend having a particularly bad time."
efe3dv,"YTA.

Sounds like you’re reading too much into that based on my limited perspective. Also, don’t air your laundry out/be passive aggressive on social media. That’s middle school behavior."
efe545,"NTA, ""aita for being upset I got a thoughtless present and was bullied all day"" obviously not"
efe766,"Hey bro, NTA. You HAND MADE something for her. Took time and effort to pull off what looks like a solid bag. Red flags should be flying around. I do hope y’all talk about it though. Best of luck."
efeb2k,"Best comment yet. Thanks. But derailing her relationship is not my intent. It bothers me that when I’m asked by friends why GF and I broke up, I’m covering for her behaviour."
efebq0,NTA Tell Uncle Fucker to shut his fucking face.
efedkf,"NAH. The world goes on even when we have special occasions, and if she doesn't want to, she doesn't have to read the article or even check her phone. Don't give it a second thought :)"
efefa8,[deleted]
efeoao,NTA- Id have been heated too. “Hey I’m not buying my granddaughter a gift but you should send your foster-sister a cash gift of $100”. This is SO RUDE and obnoxious.
efevbo,"NAH

I hate the ""where are you from"" question as much as you. I was born here in the USA, but my dad wasn't. I get the question a lot. I always respond ""New York"" and that's all they get out of me before a ""none of your business"" if they prod more."
eff4fl,"NTA - People who leave their personal belongings at the gym equipment are LAME. If they aren't using it, or even around it then they need to do the right thing and move off of it so others can actually use it. If they need to take a power poop, they need to take their shit with them. Same for conversations.. get off the racks / machines and take it to the front.

Coming back 10 minutes later and expecting to just get the rack back is lame. She left the rack, thus, forfeited her right to the rack unless she asks to work in which you can politely decline... especially if she wants to be rude about it."
eff924,NTA. I'm sorry but your mom is selfish and borderline sounds like a narcissistic parent. She had no right to give it away and then act like that.
effksd,"I’d say NTA. I do this with my little sister (8) *sometimes* as well.

If I do let her play, we set ground rules. 

She loves playing Super Smash Bros. So the rules usually are 1. Sit at the table, 2. Don’t be rough with the controllers, 3. No eating and touching it at the same time, and 4. When you are done, either shut it off or tell me. Sometimes I’ll even play with her!

A little bit of “give” with something you care about will really show your brother how much you care that you are letting him use it! He’ll remember it when he grows older. I know I sure remember every time a family member was nice enough to let me play their Gameboy or PSP when I was little. I remember every single time."
effphe,"NTA - Christmas should be a minimal stress time. So you’re not an asshole for wanting that. I don’t think you were rude or inconsiderate really at any point. 

Sounds like your friend is emotionally unstable at the minute, so expect a lot of that kinda attitude."
effq89,"NTA

While it’s fine for your mum to remain on good terms with your sister’s ex, it’s thoughtless of her to do so in such an open manner when it clearly (and understandably) upsets your sister. It’s additionally thoughtless (or perhaps sinister?) for the ex to assist in this."
effroc,"NTA, but I would bring it up to your husband, not your inlaws. And approach it like ""does this seem weird to you?"", not as a confrontational ""why do your parents hate me?!""."
effv9q,"NTA. It’s always hard for parents when the traditions change and I’m sure your mom was just upset that her vision of the day did not go as planned. That’s a bad excuse for treating you poorly, but emotions are high around the holidays."
effxnu,NTA. I think it's something that your mom deserves to know about. If you feel uncomfortable telling her on Christmas you could always wait a day or two.
efg1bh,"NTA. Your mom’s expectations are unreasonable. However, you need to explain what has/has not been done to mom before the cleaning person comes back and there is an argument between them. That’s not fair."
efg1dh,"YTA - your parents probably just wanted something for you to open on Christmas (it’s be sad if you had nothing at all). Sure they buggered up the size, but the thought was there and you crushed them for it."
efgfj9,"YTA for putting less effort in and then getting upset when he decided to Unfriend you. You were basically ignoring him, friendship is a two way streak, both parties need to participate. He was putting in the effort to continue being your friend even after you fell out due to his crush, which I’m pretty sure he’s over now. But you decided to not make an effort and he unfriends you, you can’t expect someone to be friends with you when you don’t make the effort. your acting like a shitty friend."
efggqy,"ESH.

Get a hotel room... Seriously."
efgk47,"ESH - you need to talk to your father and step mother about your grandmother’s actions. If you don’t communicate with them that you’re having issues, nothing is going to be resolved. They might not even know she’s doing this - how can they get her to stop if they don’t know you need her to? Grandma shouldn’t be doing this (it sounds like she’s harsher on your because you’re from your father’s previous marriage, especially if she doesn’t do this to your brother) but you need to step up and take steps to resolve it."
efgm6x,"NTA, and I think you know that too. You have every right to cut them off, adoptive or not."
efgrhw,"NTA- you don't sound like you have a cold, that sounds like the flu! Take care of yourself- and also, no one else wants to get sick, your husband sounds like the AH for wanting you to pass the illness on to others and not take care of yourself."
efgt3z,NTA and you should point out to him gas costs + the price of him getting a cab or uber instead of you driving him adds up to more than your $50 share. You already chipped in.
efgtcm,[deleted]
efgvvo,"YTA because you're the one that floated the idea and got her excited about it. 

I would never want to go on a trip with my parents and understand why you wouldn't want to, but you shouldn't have said anything. Sounds like you already knew your parents were irritating to be around for long periods of time and that you weren't super into the idea to begin with."
efh001,"NTA.

>Last night (Christmas Eve) he mentioned something about me making sure not to get mad at him on Christmas day.

He knows he's in the wrong when you have *explicitly* brought up the need of budgeting this year. Your daughter is working to replace the TV, so I don't necessarily understand why the Switch would all of a sudden ""replace"" last year's gift."
efh3ke,"Oh god. Eye rolls at your mother. 

You’re definitely NOT the AH. Absolutely nothing is wrong with your pride and comfort with who you are. She’s being completely intolerant and unfair and she’s trying to shame you for being your beautiful self. 

Don’t let her give you secondhand shame. Stay comfortable with yourself and don’t use your mother as a judgement stick for what is and isn’t right for you to post on social media. You’re your own man, and it’s none of her business. She should keep her opinions to herself frankly. NTA"
efh7tu,"Absolutely NTA, she got plenty of nice things and you helped pay for the airpods. She doesn't have to get everything you get, especially when you're contributing and she's not. Additionally, airpods are an expensive gift for someone who has a history of not taking care of their headphones."
efh80m,">  But how am I supposed to tell him that I don’t like his present?

I'd try ""Thank you""."
efhbot,"NTA

In these sort of situations I usually go with No Assholes Here but it sounds like she continued making types of jokes that you disliked despite asking her not to around you. The biggest one though is calling you a bad friend because you were *mourning* over the loss of someone and didn't feel okay in going out. That's a totally reasonable response and for her to make it seem as if you're in the wrong for not going totally makes her TA in my book."
efhewk,"NTA, those gifts were for her and even if they were for you, it was never discussed that they were your Christmas presents. I don't think she HAS to get you anything considering the fact that you're an adult now, but if she's gonna do it, she should do it right."
efhldh,NTA - sounds like your mom threw herself a party for your birthday.
efhqv5,"NTA. Posting on social media without someone’s permission is not right. It’s doubly wrong to get upset when someone asks you to take it down. This isn’t a picture hanging in her room, this is on the internet, possibly forever. You have every right to want privacy from this sort of thing"
efhrj4,">Me, smiling and polite because I still don't realize there is something wrong: ""Heavy huh?""

Intentional or not that was some capital shitbaggery you said. YTA, unfortunately"
efht1d,"NTA at all. While Christmas isn’t about the cost of gifts, it is completely normal and understandable to see such disparity from one sibling to another.

Last year my younger brothers each received around £300 in gifts while myself and my older brother received gifts totalling a combined price of £60. We have never received much from my father as we grew up in poverty, but since he has been remarried he has done a little better and completely spoils those kids. It’s frustrating. Not for any materialistic reason, but more as a principle as they have always received more help, love, and attention than us older children."
efhu3p,"NTA - you seem busy. You need a break from parenting. Maybe you need to recharge your own battery after 8 years of children everyday. Take a deep breath. Scream into your pillow. Take a nap. Tell your family you love them and you’ll see them next time. 

Your sanity is more important than a stressed out 45 minute rushed drive to see more kids and you may end up exhausted and tired and crash your car on the way home. I’m not saying any of this is guaranteed to happen nor do I want anything bad to happen to you. Parenting is tiring. Please rest today. Give yourself the gift of self care."
efhu5r,"YTA for overreacting. She didn't do anything malicious, and your brother wasn't unhappy. You're making a bigger deal out of this than it is, and all its doing is creating a bad mood and ruining the holiday for your family. This is the worst part of Christmas. Something is always not perfect enough and someone has to make drama"
efhuki,"NTA those aren't real friends those are people who use the term friend to take advantage of you, beware of those people they care only about themselves."
efhwfj,"NTA. You definitely aren't the asshole for feeling the way you do. He is the asshole for ignoring everyone else's wishes at Christmas. Sure he may want to sleep, but there's plenty of time for that! He should go spend time with family and the people who want to be with him. Hell, he could even sleep on the sofa at their place! 1 day a year isn't a lot to ask for."
efhyml,"YTA. It's a violation of your kids trust. They don't want to eat it and secretly feeding it to them anyway is not okay. Children are deserving of respect, and this is disrespectful of their right to choose what goes in their bodies."
efhzu1,"I won’t pass my judgement because I feel like I’m in a pretty similar boat. Parents asked for a Christmas list, I wrote down like four things, and didn’t really get any of them. Parents asked if they missed anything after I opened my gifts and pushed until I told them, now mother is upset...Christmas!"
efi1nl,Your story sounds fishy. I think your attempting to make a reasonable excuse for being a mooch.
efi2tn,"NAH, but tbh you’re being a overly sensitive. He said “whatever” and walked to his room. He didn’t say anything nasty. He can be a little annoyed that the meal largely caters to your preferences, given he offered to help cook. Honestly there’s no assholes yet, but if either of you try to make a fight out of it whoever does will be TA"
efi58o,"NTA
 your family seems toxic and I personally would not have managed to stay calm... Seriously your grandma sucks trying to play the victim card and telling you that things never happened. Children do understand and do not forget as a grown up. Glad you did it in a calm manner though."
efi9et,"NTA.  She’s the one asking for a favor, so she shouldn’t be a jerk about how it is done."
efiaya,"YTA.  She had a custom necklace made, and you gave an exact one to someone in the same group."
efibdg,"NTA. Deep cleaning and sanitizing a house is a lot of work for an allergy that you’re 99% sure isn’t real. 

Honestly, I would just continue to keep the cat out of the room she’s staying in and just clean that area. That way, you’d be respecting her and avoiding a conflict while also not going super out of your way to appease her. 

If it turns out that she actually does have an allergy, then you’ll know and can act according in the future."
efifax,"NAH - You're not an asshole for not liking a gift someone got you.

However, it all depends on how you act about receiving the gift. If I were you, I'd try to be gracious as your dad spent a lot of money on the gift. Maybe in a few weeks talk to your parents about trying to keep to your wish list as it usually has the most important items on it.

Your dad was trying to be nice, it doesn't sound malicious. It sounds like your parents love you a lot and I'm sure this issue can be solved in the future with some communication."
efigo9,NTA. Give them an ultimatum: respect him or lose me. Then you either get changed behavior or a clear reason to cut ties.
efijir,NTA. A dress with a train is totally inappropriate for someone else’s wedding! She sounds like an absolute narcissist.
efilhj,NTA. The way someone makes you feel is reason enough to reconsider how you approach them.
efioa1,:( NTA. Your family obviously loves him and doesn’t want him to be gone but you have his best interest in mind and you’re in the right here
efisyn,NTA- You and your ex are awesome for being able to give your daughter holidays together. Not all co-parenting goes that smoothly. Dump Chuck. Otherwise you’ll spend all your time worried about him acting like a spoiled brat when he should be happy he’s with someone who cares so much about her daughter. You’re a good mom. Don’t change that because of that asshole.
efivuo,"NTA.

You gave her clear repeated signs you weren't interested. The only thing I would say is you should of covered your butt by going to management sooner. Her behavior is sexual harassment. It's not your fault she peeked at someone else's private message. 

Don't contact her unless you have to. Let this blow over as much as you can."
efiwfb,"NTA 

Parents don’t like ‘my way or the highway’ when kids actually choose the highway. 

I would talk directly to your dad about this and try to resolve the issue."
efiy06,"NAH

It could have been an accidental wrap? But saying a gift isn’t valid is rude. Although I don’t know how not to be rude you could simply let it go or ask what she had in mind."
efizaq,YTA. Buy your own chocolate.
efj1ru,Info: can you alert your SO family to what is going on and step away for a few minutes?
efj1zv,"NAH, borderline you would be. The thing is: you live with your parents and he's your mother's brother. You can't tell who they can and can't invite into their own house.

But, I get you, it's not easy at all and, more than ""I don't want him because he sucks"" try maybe a different approach like ""I know he is your brother and I perfectly understand why you want him to share our stuff but having him every holiday is exhausting for me because we don't have any affinity and he makes me very uncomfortable with what he's talking about and the way he acts, maybe we could invite from time to time but, could we just slow down and enjoy a peaceful holidays while he's doing the same with his friends? "" or something along those lines."
efj2o9,"NTA.  Dude, you're 13."
efj2sq,"NTA: don’t speak for your brother, but tell him he bought you something you literally can’t have, even if that helps him for next year, and it doesn’t change anything for this year."
efj66a,"ESH, you said you knew they were snorers but still roomed with them. Snoring isn’t something you can really help. The gf isn’t obligated to apologize but it would’ve been a nice courtesy. Seems like you want a mini pity party."
efj70w,YTA - she’s old and crippled. Go see your Aunt.
efj7gd,nta. they already called you and your partner all kinds of names so might as well play the part and just stay home and enjoy each other's company's instead.
efja1n,"NAH but can you not just have a bunch of close friends and no 'best friend'? That way you avoid all of this.

Also, is there a reason why you need to tell him he's not your best friend? Like in what kind of conversation does this label even come up?"
efjckd,"NTA I'm often with the 'you're not entitled to gifts' crowd but something about your post makes me say not TA. You didn't get anything?

It's okay to think that it would have been nice to get something in this case. It's totally okay."
efjf7y,NTA - I wouldn’t want to spend time with family I didn’t even know. Yes their time is running out but it probably won’t make them happier to spend time with a grandchild they barely speak to. Maybe try to visit for a few days?
efjgt6,NTA. They will get more use of them then you will.
efjgzn,"NTA. I think this situation emphasizes a classic phrase that always seems to hold true:

""Misery loves company"""
efjj6b,"NAH

I think ur boyfriend is a bit inconsiderate since u 2 made plans together but he's splitting time between u and his friends. He also invites u to come so it seems like he's trying. I get that ur uncomfortable with them and thats fine, just have to accept that he'll make plans with friends"
efjm4t,"NTA. it’s basic respect to ask to eat someone else’s food, especially if it was made for that someone."
efjrj1,NTA. Part of gift giving is actually giving somebody the present you got them. There is no issue of them opening other presents as you said but they should have waited for your gifts.
efjsna,NTA. your mom sounds totally toxic and was way out of line.
efjt3r,YTA- you literally stole her sub-leaser. She’d found a person to sub-lease and you went out of your way to ask them to move in with you. Knowing you were going to a ‘nicer’ part of town and your current area is kinda ‘shitty’.
efjywe,"NAH, just make that clear upfront when you offer the ticket. I would consider that a good deal."
efk1b0,"NTA. Tell mom that you still care about her (if you do) but that you won't be sharing anything personal with her until you can trust her again.  And mom doesn't get to decide how long that will be, if ever."
efk1nc,"Technically NTA, but that’s a supper shitty gift dude."
efk2rp,"NTA. You have every right to ask your sisters for help. They're grown women - they can carry firewood. It's also frankly inconsiderate of your parents to have imposed those duties on you throughout childhood because you were a boy. The real asshole move, however, is giving you the silent treatment for bringing your concerns up. They're adults and they should have the self-awareness to recognize how you, their son, feels."
efk3pb,"ESH but only for going back/following to harass. Making the original statement was sufficient, everything else was revenge."
efk4c3,"NTA

However, mom is free to buy what she wants, especially a gift card.

If you got your boyfriend something in addition to the gift exchange, then that feels pretty low rent.

If you’re going to get married and this is going to be your family for the rest of your life, you might want to pick a different battle. Communicating your disappointment to individuals is healthy, but electing to not participate may come off as sour grapes."
efkacs,"NAH.

Won't exactly make your BF's Christmas that you want to return his present, but I imagine he'll understand. No point you wearing such an expensive pair of shoes if you don't even like then, anyway"
efkaqv,NTA sounds like jack wants to keep stringing her along because it’s nice for him to feel wanted by her. He sounds a bit like a narcissist honestly. You guys did the right thing looking out for her
efkatx,I was ready to call you TA until I realized that you don't live at home with them- they've come up to your house and are trying to drag you into their initiated cleaning projects?! NTA.
efkfcz,"NTA - I mean, your 4yr old son picked it out himself.  It doesn't matter if it's a dog turd under those circumstances it's the best gift ever no matter what."
efkgao,NTA. You expressed your expectations and he didn’t meet them. You’re entitled to your feelings and I don’t think you’re being unreasonable
efkhzq,"NTA sounds like your stepmother has been awful to you and your father has let her. Further, they both clearly don’t respect your views/wishes"
efkizj,"Hell naw you aint the ay-hole, I'm in the same boat as you."
efkjdo,"NTA. Dogs, like people, need exercise to be healthy; it’s a pet owner’s responsibility to ensure exercise is part of a pet’s routine. If your cousin can’t be responsible enough to care properly for her dog, she shouldn’t have one."
efkkfo,"NTA - This is a silly fight, but, she’s clearly in the wrong. While she was drunk, it doesn’t excuse her actions. She needs to suck it up and just apologize. Plus, she’s doubly the asshole for giving you the silent treatment. I absolutely loathe when people do this."
efkkwf,NTA it’s your life and you need to do what makes you happy. It honestly sounds like your brother is struggling to come to terms with your transition and career change but he’s going to need to if he wants to continue to have a real relationship with you
efkmft,"You’re 23?  NTA. You’re an adult, your parents can’t make you go out if you don’t want to, say, no thank you, I have other plans.  Don’t go."
efkndt,NTA. Call CPS.
efkpj9,"YTA 

everyone knows how this works.

You gonna join Tinder to judge people's fashion choices too?"
efks8c,What's the harm in just keeping it and not using it? You could give it away as a present to someone else. Don't create conflict when you don't need to
efksbw,"NTA

Do NOT take your children near people who are running fevers, not even for a few minutes."
efkstc,NTA he icky and your stuff was nice and clean plus that’s totally invading your space so he should’ve asked and left when told
efkyrt,"NTA. Fiancée sounds ungrateful AF and has obviously never learned how to accept a gift graciously. It’s a jerk act to have a bridal shower at all, let alone on Christmas Eve.

Sounds like you need to do something similar to what my family does - we don’t buy each other Christmas presents. We just buy for the kids. Saves a lot of expense, hassle and stress."
efkz6z,"NTA
That's an abuse situation for both the child and the dogs. It's best you called, most people turn a blind eye and move along. Cheers."
efl1se,"NTA. What’s with the lack of presents? They didn’t warn you at all? I’d have been upset for sure, especially with no explanation and cousin getting something. Could they be tricking you to see how you react before they give you something?"
efl39w,"NTA. Is your dad ever actually going to marry this person? She’s been a fiancée for a while now. Anyway, this is 100% their problem, and their loss. If your dad wants to stick with them, let him. They’ll turn on him eventually over something ridiculous and he’ll see exactly what you’re talking about."
efl4fq,"NTA

Take the high road though, and just say that you don't want to leave your partner alone, so you won't be able to come and that's it.  He'll have to deal with the rest of the family if he doesn't let you bring your partner."
efl7ob,"NTA, I understand what you both mean but I think she overreacts. It's not that bad to call you an AH so NTA. You're squared imo."
eflcp3,"ESH. Completely not constructive time or way to bring up the issue. If you wanted her to lose weight, I'm not sure you could have picked a worse way to open that conversation. She needs to listen and engage with your concerns. But she's also not wrong that porn, especially frequent porn use could be part of the problem.

More to the point do you actually want your marriage? Cause all I'm reading here is dislike and resentment. Both of you seem hostile toward each other from what you've written. And neither of you seems to be exercising empathy or compassion during disagreements. Fix that or stop posting and just get a divorce."
eflcxr,"NTA.
You're not going to be friends anymore, but it seems like you have not been treated like a friend for the last two years actually...

efleig,NTA the whole point of SS is to both give & receive a gift. You are justified to be disappointed. I hope someone brings you something in the coming days.
eflf30,"Mom here! NTA- I can somewhat see where your sister is coming from. If it's something minor then yes let the mom address it first. HOWEVER, if someone (living thing) is in danger or hurt than you are well within your right to step in. You didn't berate the child or even ""discipline"" you just calmly stepped in and lectured. It's really not a big deal. Kinda sound alike your sister had her ego bruised or is crazy controlling over the kid. But if it were me and my kid were hurting an animal while I wasn't watching I would want someone to say something..that's how kids learn."
eflfry,"NTA.  People can turn into the worst version of themselves as they decline and grow older, and caregiver fatigue is a thing."

You're not under any obligation to invite anyone to your party you don't want to and frankly A is being kind of a prick for trying to invite someone to a party she's not throwing. 

Especially someone who's going to make the party less fun. Instead of inviting the cop, I'd consider disinviting A tbh. The three of them can go out to the bars or something."
eflhur,A gentle YTA. Getting gifts stolen and maybe ending up with a gift that’s not your first choice is part of white elephant. You should let the game ruin your entire night and it seems like you’re really stewing over this when really it’s just supposed to be a fun game.
eflill,ESH why are you only blaming your husband’s affair partner instead of him? It takes two to tango.
efljw7,"YTA. You're a teenager, if you're capable of writing this post, you're also more than capable of asking a classmate for his or her copy and walking to a copier. The whole ""I don't remember getting it"" doesn't quite help either, as your classmates do have a copy."
eflmld,"NAH, but do you have to tell her?

My thoughts are that *nobody* likes having someone else return their present, even if the logic is sound (as it currently is). If you sneakily return it and she's none the wiser....."

Your friends aren't the only ones being shallow. He spent about 3 GRAND. That's a ton of money! More than I make in almost two months. Having a smaller ring doesn't mean he loves you less. He picked that because he felt it was the right one for you. I'm sure he put a lot of effort into it. Complaining about how it's not big enough or expensive enough just seems ungrateful."
eflpo2,"Nta, she’s knows it’s your birthday and it should be your day, it sounds like she intentionally does it to keep attention on her."
eflqjt,"NTA. I have a childhood friend since I was 3 years old and we were always super close and people would always bother me about it saying we must be a couple. It's always been like siblings between us though, and that makes 23 years now and no change. Thankfully my family listened to me and understood. I'm sorry you're having a hard time with your family not understanding you."
eflrim,"NAH, though you would be an asshole if you acted on this.

You're a grownup now. I realize generosity was a way you saw affection in the past, but you need to realize that your childhood traditions and expectations are going to have to shift with times.

If you use things like your envy for your brother's gifts as a source of friction, you will find that your relationship, so strained this year, will remain strained or broken indefinitely."

efmnj7,"ESH. I get not wanting to feed the ungrateful family and their gaggle of kids when they have never reciprocated. Especially when you're on a budget. It also sucks for your wife to feel like she's in the middle of the situation, and it sucks for you to feel stressed over having to figure out a new budget. I would wait for the hubbub to die down, then discuss finding a middle ground. Maybe instead of doing dinner you can have your own feast together and get together with her siblings for dessert. If your wife makes a killer pie, and they show up with store bakery cookies, smile and take a cookie knowing you got a beautiful meal, and they can smile over the fact that the cookies are as easy to pick up as a bag of chips."
efmpvl,"If this is real I'm going to go with ESH, you should have kept it between yourself and your wife to prove a point that you shouldnt have to go see her family.

In the neighbourhood I used to live during my uni days I would have been scared to eat it if it wasn't dropped off into my own hands. They either would have spit on it or it wouldn't even have made it to me because they ate it 😖

Besides, there wouldn't even be a way to complain and object if you had been delivered the wrong toppings or it was cold or something like that."
efnaai,"ESH, but mostly your mom.

You certainly could have timed it better, but your mother probably needed to hear this from somone. Your father is working himself into an early grave to support her selfish lifestyle. I don't blame you for wanting things to change.

efnbw0,"NTA. I don't really know what to say other than I'm sorry OP, this sounds like a sucky situation. I don't want to assume things about your mom, but all I can say is that I hope the rest of your day gets a little better. Merry Christmas"
efnfiw,"You couldn’t write her a nice card or get her a candle or something? It’s your grandmother. She wasn’t an asshole for privately expressing disappointment. Are you sure she didn’t also say something to your sister in private?

Honestly I have WAY more debt than you and live paycheck to paycheck, but I still manage to get gifts for my parents, siblings and grandparents. Sometimes those gifts don’t cost much at all. It’s the thought that counts. Come on man. Life isn’t all about capitalizing on savings.

Soft YTA or at least NAH. She has every right to be slightly disappointed you did nothing and express that to you."
efnklb,"YTA if you’re asking for money for something you already gave him for free.
It would be very different if this was a prior arrangement, ie, “Pay me back when you can”, but since you already agreed to giving him the computer for free, it’s an asshole move to ask for money."
efnl1s,"These are children, whose parent is lazy or ignorant. I have had similar situations, unfortunately. You have to become the ""parent"" of this situation, by beginning to put some rules in place. It won't help for this Christmas, but you can make it a better situation by next year.  (Just start telling/teaching them what you expect, even using  wording like "" good neighbors call first"" or whatever it is you want them to do.) Then enforce the new rule for a month, and next month add another one. If their parent won't teach them, you have to, or put up with their ignorance."
efnlch,"NTA, $1 gifts can be great and thoughtful. I have given and recieved them to delight all around and often knew the cost. Gifts that were free with a purchase have been given and recieved with delight. 

That is not what happened here. Your sister was thoughtless and rude. Her 'gift' was much more a gesture of dismissal and insulting. I cannot imagine the emotions that you must have felt knowing that she got them intending to give them away to people she was obligated to buy for."
efnmgc,"NTA - BUT why is everyone in your family so passive aggressive? I come from the Deep South and you better believe someone would have told him to get his ass up and let my mother sit down, to hold up and let everyone get served before he had seconds and slapped the damn beer out of his hand when he grabbed it. 
It as much y’alls fault for letting him walk all over you as it is him being an ignorant ape."

efnyvi,"No, you are sweet and wonderful children. Your mother behaved horribly."
efo02s,NTA. You're entitled to feel exactly how you do and to vent to people who are supposed to care about you whenever you want. As a heavy guy I know exactly what you may be feeling. I'm sorry its caused you so much pain. Keep talking to them. If they don't understand or don't want to that's a decision on their part. All you can do is decide who you want to share your feelings with. If they can't be there for you perhaps it's time to look for someone that can.
efo0nk,"NTA, that's not acceptable behavior or an acceptable thought process for someone regardless of their mental status. There is no mental illness that makes you misogynistic , it's a choice. Also, no offense, but I doubt the fact that he is religious is helping the situation. Christianity along with most religions are notoriously misogynistic in many of its interpretations."
efo35e,"NTA. You said Merry Christmas. Are you supposed to jump up and down waving? Also, if you don't know the boyfriend well, what's the point of coming on super friendly when your relationship with your mom is already strained?"
efo54d,"YTA in a massive, massive way. You and your husband have *three* children. Not two plus a leftover from his old family. You made it extremely clear to a *12 year old child* that you don't consider her a full member of your family then you compounded that by showing clear favoritism in the gift giving. I don't blame her at all for not wanting to be part of your family anymore - why would she when *you* clearly don't want her in it either. Destroy all the photos that exclude her but include your other children and tell her you did it because sometimes grown-ups do stupid, hurtful things because they didn't think things through. Assure her she is an absolutely necessary part of your family (she will never believe this as long as the exclusionary photos exist, btw, so don't even think about sneakily keeping any of them) and that you will be very careful to show that in the future. Then see if you can find any resources on how to be a fully inclusive stepmother because, honestly, it sounds like you need them and spend the rest of your life making that sweet little girl feel like a the special, necessary part of your family that she is."
efo804,"NTA- don’t give it if you can’t take it.

Side note, you probably should shave the mustache."
efo998,NTA why should you get so much less just because you have a job? Doesn't seem fair to me.
efoadj,It sounds like she’s upset about a pattern of behavior and this particular incident opened up the flood gates.

> My gf laughed and said she hasn’t been to the gym in forever.

> she burst into tears and told me that I humiliated her in front of my family, she was the fattest person there, my family didn’t like her, she ate too much, “healthy” is code for fat, etc

I'm just some redditor, but based off what you say in this post it sounds like a lot of red flags for a eating disorder."
efoet6,"NTA. Your mom's reaction was over the line. I will say though, as someone who was hospitalized for my ED a few years ago, your mom reacted this way because she's scared for you. Try not to hold it against her."

efog6l,"NAH.

You can't help your feelings, and they can't help theirs. Unfortunately, this is one of those situations where not everyone can be happy. No one's fault, just the way life is sometimes. 

However, you should not act on your feelings in this case. Preventing them from dating won't change their feelings and won't get you a date with Isaac. It won't make you happier, but it will make them less happy.

Sorry you're in this situation."
efoh2m,"YWBTA for telling your cousin to get lost just because you have a 'new life' and your worried of losing it; like really? Your an adult now, not a child.

efoscq,"NTA, although your timing sucks. It sounds like a serious conversation is in order, but it doesn’t absolutely need to be on Christmas. 

Parents/grandparents who play favorites suck. It’s just so wrong and can do long term damage to kids. Any good grandmother has more than enough love for all of her grandchildren... not just the ones born to her needy child. 

I feel for you. Hope it gets better quickly."
efoswi,"Going to say NTA. Yeah it's her house, but it's a ridiculous thing to expect from a grown adult visting her in the first place. Not living with her, visiting. The fact that she not only turned the situation into a melodramatic thing about HER, but also slept in the damn hall to make sure you wouldn't sneak out?

Yeah, no. You're not TA. Good on you for leaving. It's not asshole-ish to expect your parents to treat you like an adult."

efp0fl,"NTA, saw what they were trying to do and you tried to defend your stuff from the sound of it. Part of the issue with big organizations - sometimes you’re forced to be wrong. 

Some people might have issue with the told you so, but I think it’s fine. You did. 

What game is it?"
efp1oy,"NTA. 

You have digestion issues. This is a real, diagnosed condition with serious physical impacts and physical manifestations. 

Because it's an inside issue rather than an outside one, it can be difficult for your family to ""get"" that you are sick, or just how sick. Because this manifests most noticeably through something you'd usually keep private, it can be difficult fro your family to know what s the condition, and hat is something else they fear you having like rejecting them or an eating disorder or something. 

These issues are not unique to you and your family, everyone with digestive health issues goes through the same bs, and there is so much information and support available these days to help your family come to terms with what this condition is and what it means as far as impact on you. Ask your doctor for some resources for them, to help them understand what's going on."
efp24v,NTA. Your parents opted to wait until the last minute to make plans and that didn’t work out for them this year. It’s too bad that they have limited schedules but I don’t see why everyone else should have to shift things around to accommodate them.

Based on the original post you make it seem like they hate you for absolutely no reason."
efp7p3,"NTA- I have a rule now that I live in a small space that anything I didn’t wear or use after a year gets donated, sold, or gifted. Simple as that. Three years is a long time, especially if she knew it didn’t fit and hadn’t hinted that she wanted you to wear it. 

That being said I really don’t think she cares about a stranger’s opinion on the internet. Like you said, I think you should just take it, get her flowers and say that you value her not for the gifts she gives you but the time you spend together. Maybe candy. Maybe a teddy bear. Whatever she likes. Surprise her with it."
efp9ex,"YTA He should be allowed to experiment It’s completley natural. You should knock, had you knocked would you have avoided this. Calling it disturbing makes it worse.

1. Your ex broke up with you over email. Dick move. Do it in person.

efpnxd,"NTA - Yeah, I get that the parents wanted to go on a family trip and everyone's bashing OP because that should have been enough. 23 yo brother got to go and it wasn't his birthday. Other kids got to go and it wasn't their birthday. The parents don't get the benefit of giving OP a paid vacation for her birthday when all of the siblings got the same thing and it wasn't their birthday. I don't care how old you get, gifts for your birthday are nice. And if one sibling gets one then both should. Maybe not the same dollar value but something that would be appreciated. Hell, I'm 36 and my mom still gets me a gift, not a $14 drink. She's paid for vacations for us, etc. Yes, I work. But I just happen to be an only child with a very generous mother which probably skews my views a bit. That said, the parents were jerks about it and OP has every right to feel whatever they feel."

efpqe6,"NAH

Its ok to be disappointed in not getting a gift you were expecting, and its even ok to be irrationally upset when it isn't justified. Emotions are like that and a lot of the time you just can't control how you feel about something. What I wouldn't do is hold it against them. The reality is there could be a million reasons why they didn't get it for you - it seems like maybe they were expecting another family member to get it but that didn't pan out at the last minute, or maybe something else entirely. They obviously feel bad on some level about it, and this isn't the kind of thing where you want to let the bad feelings grow out of proportion. Your parents love you and people make mistakes.

You attacked a completely innocent person to defend yourself against an awful person."
efq3fc,"I feel like you have to be leaving something out here. If it really is the case that your parents randomly decided that they'd spend $200+ on each sibling and then only 35 on you, then maybe NTA, but could it be that they spent a lot on you at other times of the year? Or depending on your age, maybe you are going to college soon and they are going to be at least partially financially supporting you through that?"

efqce0,"YTA ranting at a waiter when you’re actually worked up about a conversation is not appropriate.

Also, this bill was your friend’s to handle. The appropriate time to dispute a bill is before it is paid. It is true that the waiter cannot do much anyway, especially with a paid bill.

It's okay to need breaks; even biological parents get burned out without breaks, but you need to choose the timing of those breaks carefully. ETA: Also look into therapy for her. The level of clinginess you describe is pretty uncommon in middle schoolers, so she might have some lingering abandonment issues from her mom or something that she could benefit from discussing with a therapist."

Here’s the secret: everyone’s bad at buying gifts. Everyone gets gifts that they don’t want or need because your friends and family seldom know what you actually want. But the holidays are about keeping your grievances to yourself and faking a smile to give the illusion of grand holiday joy in order to feel closer to the ones you care about.

You’ve explained repeatedly that you wanted him to pick out the gifts for his side of the family, buy the gifts, wrap the gifts, and he ignored all of it until you were forced to do it. He did this because he knew you eventually would do it for him. You have every right to be mad and not want to go to this party.

I’m not a radical feminist, but I think it’s lazy and too personal. Apologize to me in a meaningful, businesslike way. Don’t appeal to my vagina and think a bouquet of flowers will make me squee with delight and make everything be bygones.

I had a similar situation once. A male colleague didn’t show up to a training meeting involving me and our boss. We waited an hour, which killed my day. I told him I didn’t appreciate him not respecting our time, and to be mindful of that in future. He responded by buying me flowers. I said ‘I don’t need flowers, I need professional courtesy.’

You're boyfriend's behavior is WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE. 

Even if he thinks he's coming from a nice, protective, boyfriend place, here's what he actually did: 

He decided that you were incapable of handling your own problems. He removed your ability to make decisions by taking this situation into his own, presumably violent, hands. -I say presumably violent, because really, what was he gonna do? Speak nicely to whoever? 

He threatened your livelihood. Most states are at will. If I'm your boss and your boyfriend starts calling your job, demanding anything at all, I'm going to think you asked him to, and I'd definitely call the cops and report him for harassment. If his behavior continued, first I'm going to make sure you're OK, but if you can't get it together, I'm firing you. No one needs this bullshit

He made you look weak and unstable. Seriously. His behavior is so far beyond the bounds of social conventions that I have to assume there's something significantly wrong with him mentally or intellectually, and you by association. Again, if I'm your boss, I just lost so much respect for you. It would be my opinion that not only are you incapable of managing your work life, you're incapable of managing your home life as well. 

In short, your boyfriend said he doesn't respect you, your agency, your decision making ability, or your livelihood, and was willing to make you look like shit in order to be ""nice"".

By refusing to cut your son out of your life you are not condoning what you see as sin, but making a choice to love in spite of sin just like Jesus did for us . 

Don’t cut your son out. Work to help your family become closer to your savior 

(Disclaimer: I don’t actually believe being gay is a sin at all- but OP clearly does so debating that is futile )"

This is when you say ""Oh, no! I wish you had called before you made the trip- I have plans I can't change. Maybe in a few months but Jim- you have to call *first.*""    

End of your statement. No further reasons, no negotiations, no nothing. Just that you have other plans. What those plans are is irrelevant- could be eating  cheetos and watching TV.     
If they press just say ""Really- I can't."" and leave that uncomfortable silence hanging there.  
But make it clear that it won't work *and*  that calling before showing up is necessary in the future."
efxz4h,"NAH. They could've stolen it if they wanted it. 

I deliberated about a soft Y-T-A because you seem kind of judgmental and out of sync with what everyone else wants from this gift exchange. But I assume you go along with it because it's your husband's family's tradition, and there's nothing wrong with you *wanting* to end up with something you actually like instead of some silly novelty, so as long as you're not insulting the other participants, I think you're fine."
efxz8x,NTA - Your brother’s mad because you helped clean up his house...?
efy6ib,"Oi vey, I am torn. Keeping her present would be aholeish but it is the reasonable thing to do. She has done nothing in the past long while (it sounds) to indicate that she will appreciate it. Based on all evidence, it would be a waste.

efyizc,NTA sounds like her mother bullied the family into bullying you. Congratulations!

Not trying to be rude when I say this, but it sounds like you are being overly sensitive. Also to be clear my judgment is only based off this situation that you described. You mentioned that you have other reasons for not liking him, but I can only judge based off of what you describe here. 

You already acknowledged the fact that you did not train your dog well, and now for some reason N had to take care of your dog and noticed that it wasn't trained well. Then when he said to you that it was difficult for him because you didn't train it well, you start crying?

You and your gf need to schedule this much better, and you need to plan ahead rather than try make this up on the fly. Your plans should have incorporated you visiting your gf's family multiple times during this week that you're home, on dates known far enough in advance that they will know when you would visit. On the day or days where X-mess actually is celebrated, you and your gf needed to travel back and forth a bit so that both family see both you and your gf for X-mess."

However, they can suck it up for one evening."
eg089m,"NTA. Once you said you weren't comfortable, it was inappropriate of your friend to push. You don't owe anything to her or this stranger who wants to impose on you for six months for free. It's totally fair to use a white lie to stop her from pressuring you, although be aware that there is enormous potential for her to find out you're lying resulting in significant blowback, so you would probably be better off just standing your ground and giving the honest answer that you don't feel comfortable living with a stranger.

I also find it confusing/alarming that this guy needs 3-6 months to find a place to rent. Does he have bad credit or something? Normally, as long as you have an ok credit history and enough income to easily cover rent, it doesn't take that long to find a place."

Best case scenario it takes him extra time to get a job because he’s stressed about potentially being homeless, and worst case scenario you ruin your relationship with your brother because he doesn’t like being manipulated like that.

This is a pretty big red flag to me. Do you regularly do things like changing your mind and making other people redo work? I had an ex who would do that to assert his dominance and This smells like that to me."
eg0w5f,"YTA. ""I refuse to believe she already knows everything to know about dancing on Broadway.""

Regardless of anyone elses opinion"
eg2ekj,"ESH.  The comment your mother made was far from innocent.  She was insulting your aunt and probably knew it would hit your aunt in a vulnerable spot.  Your mom owes your aunt an apology.

He doesn't love me any less and I don't want expensive gifts, but I do feel really good if he puts some effort into it. If he gets me a flower, I melt. If your husband is similar to this, price of the voucher doesn't matter, it's the though behind it and if that's not what you're into, talk about it before giving him huge amount of money, they don't translate to love very well."

eg2rt9,"YTA, hes had plenty of time to infect you, and actually may no longer be contagious.

And the comfort of company.  Plus I have 3 younger siblings, so we were usually fighting for couch space in all reality, and having is both in 1 spot made it easier on mom to care for us, and my dad didnt have to go all the way to the back if the house (a lot of times hed work from home)."
eg2uwo,"NAH, but you have options. Here are a couple:

“Wow, that was a long time ago when I had a lot more free cycles. Now I’ve got a staff and I’ve got to keep everyone fully utilized in order to keep the company going. I can have folks work on your site at no charge when they have free time, but it will probably take at least eighteen months to get the site done. I just simply can’t afford to pull people off paying work to do free work. Alternately, we could discuss some sort of reduced rate that would enable me to get the site done faster.”

“I’m so sorry, but when I made that offer I was in a very different place professionally. Now we’ve got a successful company and are working hard to make it grow. It wouldn’t be fair to my employees to make them work on something that wasn’t helping to move the company forward. As businessmen, I’m sure you understand.”

I’d suggest working this out directly between you and them. It sounds like your wife is not helping things."

Engagements are supposed to be a big deal, if you can afford something nicer than costume jewelry, it is expected that you get it. No reasonable adult wants an engagement ring they can get from a Cracker Jack box. 

Obviously if you can’t afford something more than $200 then it is what it is, but that’s not the case here. Both parties are successful and make decent money. Unless he’s some edgy wanker that’s “trying to prove a point” by getting a pathetically cheap ring, it shows a blatant lack of caring. I dare any woman in here to genuinely say she’d be totally fine with a cheap ass engagement ring and I’ll point out all the liars.

eg39i1,NTA. that shits expensive and it’s extremely disrespectful to use it even after being told that they weren’t allowed.
eg3b3e,Nta she sounds like a shit person to be around
eg3b73,[deleted]
eg3gdl,"NAH, but trust me kid, let this one go. Your mom just wants to do something to make her kids happy, and she doesn't have the money to do it how she wants. Just pretend to like the headphones, it will mean more to her than you can understand right now."
eg3jk3,"NTA, your family doesn't want him reported because they don't want to lose him? You are better off driving the hour to a better doctor anyway."
eg3nr9,"NTA. Based on the gift that your daughter received, I'd say that they treated her badly as well. That family sounds like a bunch of racist assholes to me and a young child shouldn't be in such an environment imo."
eg3ovw,"NAH I get your side. This can be looked at from different angles, and you aren't on the same page.

You're right that you can't really stop him, but in turn he can't stop you from leaving if he did.

Though question, is he truly planning on doing this, or is you being 'controlling' in his eyes what makes him want it more?"
eg3rbn,NTA she’s just a buddy you aren’t trying to hookup and you tried to hook him up it’s his problem not yours
eg3ud3,"NTA. Your family and friends suck for giving you gifts they know you cannot enjoy- that isn't thoughtful at all (and the thought DOES count, so there you go)."
eg3vcb,NTA but do it now so she has time to make other arrangements.
eg3vrt,"Ywbta if you push him farther away with hateful emotions. Wait until your calm and discuss how it hurts you guys and that you love him. He sounds like he's in an abusive relationship with this girl, and hurling a bunch of hurtful things towards is only gonna drive him further away, as well as make it less likely he'll ever be back. Be patient and hope for the best. Don't make things worse by losing your head."
eg3vu1,"NTA

You're just returning his property."
eg3wlz,"NAH. I think that as long as you make it clear that it is pay your own way prior to the event, then no harm no foul. 

YWBTA if you announced it at the dinner table when the bill came."
eg40oa,"ESH. You can’t insist on a plus one. You asked, they said no. However your friend sucks, usually the whole wedding party gets a plus one because they are your closest friends. 

Also I’d doubt how close you really are if they haven’t even met this woman you’ve been dating and don’t seem to care about your request to bring her."
eg4377,"YTA. The child is hers too, you cannot weaponize a child to spite your ex. Consider how this may have an impact on your child, growing up and into adulthood."
eg4458,"NTA. Your mom has no boundaries and makes it really difficult to set them. She has zero respect.

Nothing you can do but really emphasize how much you hate her behavior and maybe stop texting (call instead to respond) and have a actual argument with her to get the point across."
eg44ql,NTA. She had you on the back-burner in case plans with her BF didn’t work out. It’s not fair of her to expect you to wait around when you have a life and friends of your own.
eg44uf,NTA. Plans should be discussed between both parties first. The only exception are surprise trips you KNOW the other has talked about/will enjoy.
eg45o5,"If you wrote in the review about the terrible customer service and the non response from management and that due to the poor service, you didn't eat from there, then you are NTA."
eg45we,"NTA. Make the manual. Also typically most custody agreements have a clause that says if the  PARENT who is getting custody during said time isn't the one actively caring for said child (besides daycare or school) then you have no obligation to hand the kid over. I.e if your ex is out of town you don't have to hand your kid over to his parents for ""his time"" work related reasoning or not. Document each time he doesn't take her or is out of town during his custody time that way if he goes back and tries to fight for more time or if things go sour you have proof of when he took her, when he did not, and when he tried to get his parents to watch her. Personally, I wouldn't let your kid go over there unless he was there and there the entire time, if he goes out of town your kid comes back home. It isn't your fault or problem he has to travel for work and isn't worth the anxiety and stress of wondering how she is being treated by the grandparents/if their doing things the way you want them done."
eg4738,"NTA Your family are AH though! That’s not how you talk to or treat your family! There is at least an apology owed here and a major need to a change in their behavior! 
It makes me sad to see you say you “have to live with looking the way you do” because I’m sure you’re beautiful no matter what you’ve been led to believe!"
eg474i,NTA. Honestly don’t be friends with this chick. She’s just being petty and nasty. She probably says a lot worse behind your back.
eg493b,"NAH- It was a nice, thoughtful gesture that you thought she would appreciate. I’m sure she does, but she is still new in the grieving process and probably misses him terribly. You didn’t do it to be mean as you didn’t know how she would react."
eg4b2p,NTA.  She is being rude and not respecting any boundaries.
eg4hs5,"YTA. Mostly because you have already decided it just isn’t going to happen, and that’s not fair to your partner. This is clearly something that is important to her, she made it clear early on, and now you are acting like it isn’t important or that she doesn’t have “valid” or good enough reasons for wanting to move. 

If I was your wife I would be massively resentful at having my needs dismissed this way."
eg4jmk,NTA. Narcissism is one hell of a drug.
eg4k7a,NTA. That’s insane. Talk to a lawyer in their state ASAP.
eg4kc2,NTA. That’s hilarious and serves her right. Can’t be on a high horse when you have skeletons in your closet.
eg4kkc,YTA. It’s called communication.
eg4odw,NTA. Your mom sounds like a narcissist.
eg4orq,"How you gonna squeeze money out of someone whi won't even give you a cent?

NTA but your mom is right, knowing your neighbour, you probably won't be seeing money OR a mug. Tell your neighbour to bring his own mug when he comes over so he doesn't break another one."
eg4p7g,"NTA, and her reaction is really weird. Seems like she is trying convert you, good luck with that."
eg4qda,Esh. You shouldn't be buying such lavish gifts on your income and your family could have done you better...
eg4sim,"ESH. He obviously sucks for cheating, but if you cared about the cheating you should have brought it up with the gf when you found out. At this point it's just gonna seem spiteful"
eg4w4z,Nta. That store just scammed your nana. Tell her the truth and maybe get the authorities involved since this is a crime. Businesses that do this are a pox on society and need to be burned down like plaque infested blankets. Who knows how many other people this store has scammed.
eg5109,"I will never understand people who expect you to be photographed whenever they feel like.

NTA."
eg528a,"YTA only in that you really didn’t pick the right time or place to raise this issue with mom. My mom used to do the same thing. I am in my 30s, married, and while I have gotten her down to some, she still buys too much. The time to bring this up with her is not when she has already bought all the gifts, but before she puts in the work. Raise this in October, not December."
eg55pe,"YTA.

Jesus dude these are all minor requests. Annoying, but none of them “interrupted your eating.” I am guessing that you probably were sitting there at the meal making zero conversation with your mother since that would interrupt your eating too. For that alone, YTA."
eg55qb,Boss is banging your coworker. And you would not be the asshole if you quit without two weeks notice.
eg58rc,"YTA - Yeah, technically might be E-S-H for him making fun of your GF, but outing him is so disproportionate that's really the only relevant part of the story. You owe your brother a sincere and heartfelt apology after which you stand by him and help him do damage control in whatever way he sees fit."
eg5apa,"Oh Honey, no one wants to read your blog. YTA"
eg5bwb,"Since I'm seeing this so often, I've decided anyone coming here complaining about getting gifts is going to automatically be the asshole unless they have a more valid reason than not getting equal shares of presents.

YTA & ungrateful."
eg5c4x,NTA. He has known for a long time that you had the cats and were a package deal. What exactly does he expect you to do with them? Sounds like he wants a pet free life; is that something you also want?
eg5exr,"NTA. Bodily autonomy is important, and you aren't a doll."
eg5g1i,"NTA- your family is kind of dumpster fire, and I think you need to get the hell away from there ASAP. Move out. Now."
eg5imc,"NTA. You’re absolutely right. A gift is just that, a gift. If it came with strings attached it would be a loan."
eg5lyw,"NTA- just because shitty things happen to shitty people it doesn’t mean they’re not shitty people anymore, and you shouldn’t be forced to interact with people who have been abusive/toxic to you."
eg5mip,"ESH. Your boyfriend's friends sound like assholes, but you shouldn't be putting yourself in the position of making him choose between you and them. You definitely have a bias (again, because they're assholes), but it would be wrong to force him in the middle, unless their abusive behavior continues. He would definitely need to know about it, and if he doesn't care, then you have more information about HIM. Let him decide whether your time is worth it, otherwise it might be time to move on."
eg5nm9,"YTA. It’s ridiculous you interpreted “not much” as “nothing” and you didn’t even clean the kitchen. Your mother is sad because you’re spectacularly thoughtless. It might take her some time to get over it. You can’t buy her forgiveness or goodwill with another gift. Step back bro. You fucked up. Even “misunderstandings” can still hurt. You made yourself seem extremely thoughtless and your intent doesn’t mean shit when you literally don’t get your own mother a present and get one for everyone else. 

Your insistence she take responsibility for your mistake is even worse. You make it all about you -
“Your” back is against the wall. Her feelings aren’t hurt to punish you. They’re just hurt. Leave her be and she’ll forgive you. Knock Christmas outta the park next year."
eg5qzp,Just talk to them about it. Tell them it's great for a quiet space but for your setup it won't really work and you were thinking you might sell it (return it?) and use the money to get something related that would help.
eg5rlw,"NTA. That money is legally yours. 

Would it be great if you were just cool and whatever about the money? fucking yes that would make you an awesome friend.  

However it's not at all required. 

Would it be great if M had been clear about the security of your living situation or given you the deposit money (which he HAD) right away instead of keeping some for himself to float financially completley disregarding your own financial security and that of the other roommate? No. It would be a basic fucking requirement of being a decent person.

Fuck ""rude"". **Rude in this case means ""My brother can't profit off you""** these losers don't know your finances you could be struggling too, do they give two shits? No.  

So fuck them and their bullshit and take the dough."
eg5ur7,NTA... start wrapping up the stuff she has given you in the past and give it back
eg5vkx,NTA - it is completely. Up to you. You *will* hurt your dad's feelings. Whether or not he deserves (for lack of a better word) to have them hurt is up to you. Personally I see where you're coming from.
eg5ylp,Not at all
eg61a1,"NTA

You're a medical professional and you're simply doing your duty of care."
eg61ck,"YTA from what I can tell because this was honestly hard to follow.

Your wording makes it pretty clear you’re horribly judgmental. Your sister may have lots of issues and a long list of mistakes, but there’s a difference between tough love and kicking someone while they’re down.

You didn’t say that to her to help her, you said it because you wanted to feel superior. If she wants to improve her life, you clearly aren’t the person she should rely on."
eg6320,"NTA - If both of you don't want to go, don't go. Enjoy your holidays together."
eg64bg,"NAH. You're trying to honour your brother's wishes and your parents are trying to deal with the lose of their child. This is causing the conflict, not any malice. Both parties need to talk it through and work out a compromise. It's easy for people to fall back to traditions and that might be what your parents are doing but there also might be some things that have a deep meaning to them. And I get it's your brother's funeral so it should be what he wanted but as you mentioned, it is also for the living.

Sit down with your parents and work out the funeral together, work out which bits are important to all of you and go from there."
eg68ca,"YTA. 

It’s not a joke. It’s meant to put her down and you know it."
eg69s8,"NAH - she wasn’t offended at your joke, you weren’t offended at her’s, so it’s all good."
eg6at2,"NTA.

First of all, this isn't kindergarten, and you weren't obligated to bring enough for the class.

Second, you don't just take food out of another person's hand. Even if he didn't know they were yours, even if he thought they were jellybeans that corporate sent in for everyone, it would STILL be inappropriate to just grab the bag out of your hands without asking."
eg6hnt,"Nta. What is it with families expecting everyone to sleep over but not providing guest beds?! If there isn't a comfy place to sleep, you shouldn't be expected to stay. Pregnant or not makes no difference. Not being comfortable should be enough reason. Period."
eg6j35,NTA - she can't take money from you agreeing to pay it back then when you confront her sh pulls the parent card.
eg6kwn,"NTA, watching her not get asked to do people's makeup and her being sad because of that would've been worse."
eg6nvi,NTA! You’re the one that needs to wear the ring and your opinions about it are valid
eg6oe8,NTA because you didn’t have room. All the rest was just petty padding on the cake :)
eg6r0w,YTA. If you are always working 100-120 hours a week you do not really have a marriage/family. And you sound very judgemental. She is running the household and raising the kids. Give her a break.
eg6rv8,"NTA. Him and his wife not planning their food is their own fault. If they didn't want to lose their money they should've prepared. Instead, they didn't think things through and they now want compensation, after everyone had already eaten with no indication that that they were gonna need to pay beforehand. If you can pay the $10, I'd just do it, but I wouldn't think you're an asshole if you didn't."
eg6t3p,"NTA for wanting it, but you may be for forcing it against your husbands wishes unless he likes that sort of assistance from you. You would certainly be within reason to request that he doesn't come over any more. The 'no/yes' thing is weird, as a simple 'no' text seems way harsher to me than 'nope'."
eg6uy5,"NTA, she belongs in choosing beggars frankly. She's getting a car for few days for $65? That's infinitely cheaper than she'd get it renting from somewhere. If she wanted a cheap oil change, she should have taken it early and she chose not to (and also where can you get an oil change for only $35?). The condition of the car borrowing was she should get the change done and pay for it. That's still the condition."
eg6w2b,"NTA and your wife is being a sooky la la.

I love reading the plot to a film before I see it because I enjoy the movie a lot more. I don’t give away the spoilers either.

Your wife asked you if you’d read the spoilers for Avengers - you answered honestly. Her saying that you knowing what was going to happen somehow ruined the film for her is utterly ridiculous and childish."
eg6w5r,NTA He should make time for the two of you and not call you boring.
eg6w7k,NTA  Maybe this would be a good time to block them.  It's crazy that they think you should be the one to take care of them.
eg71qc,[deleted]
eg738y,NTA. You shouldn’t have to be subjected to your mother in laws addiction just because she’s too lazy to go outside and smoke. That’s disgusting.
eg73uj,"YTA. Mind your own business and stop making assumptions.

1. The reason people make lists is so that the other person knows that they'll like what they get. Giving a list makes sure what you get is something you'll like. It's good for both the person buying the gifts as well as the person receiving it. There is nothing wrong with telling people what you want. A list doesn't mean she's a gold digger who expects 500 things for xmas.
2. The doing half the chores has nothing to do with being a gold digger. How do you know that the boyfriend didn't come up with 50/50 himself? Or they're both happy with doing 50/50, because making more money shouldn't necessarily excuse you from housework? Maybe she does more than 50/50, and you either don't know it or you're exaggerating? Or maybe... just maybe... he likes doing some housework and chores?
3. You called your sister a gold digger then told her you ""hope she blows him every night,"" and you're seriously here claiming you didn't ruin Christmas? This was not the time for you to ""stand up"" for her boyfriend, let alone how poor of a job you did. Stay in your lane."
eg75l6,"NTA. Why tf do people think that the price of *any* piece of jewelry, **especially** a wedding band/engagement ring is appropriate to ask?!"
eg75o0,NTA. You have not done anything wrong. Don't be surprised if your post gets deleted as you're clearly NTA.
eg77b8,"Tbh, that sounds like an awful group, sounds way too much like ""incels"". Not sure if your comments came off as an A or not, but I'm leaning definitely to NTA. But leave that group and don't ever look back. It sounds incredibly toxic."
eg77ee,">My gf daughter has been so unreasonable lately (ruining world stuff I have out, silent treatment, and screaming) that I told her she was being petty, ridiculous, and should be thankful for how nice she has it instead of being a brat. 

She's 14. *14*. You just ended her world as far as she's concerned (maybe not for the first time, depending how and when you and your gf got together), because she's at that age where friends and familiarity are paramount, and you, someone she's already disliked intruding upon her family, are taking all that away from her. Your reasoned arguments about science labs mean nothing to her right now.

Whether she (or you) likes it or not, you're her stepfather role now, meaning that you can make big life decisions with your gf and she will have to follow; but it also means the things you said to her were completely unreasonable and cruel, since they came from an ersatz father figure.

She doesn't like you; she's a troubled 14-year-old in a home life she never wanted. You don't like HER: you're almost three times her age and make that dislike well-known, hence the running away. That's not a balanced equation. You have a responsibility to try to be more understanding of this ""brat"" you seem to feel was thrust upon you.

Move where you have to, give her time to adjust, but YTA. You said some truly fucked-up shit to a young teenager acting like a young teenager."
eg79f8,"I’m going against the grain here and say NTA. yes, cleaning isn’t a big deal, but cleaning in front of guests who have *never come to your house before or even met you* definitely sends the wrong message. If I was in basically a strangers home and they started cleaning, I’d assume they no longer wanted to interact with me. Watch out, sounds like your mom could end up on r/justnomil if this continues

eg7flf,NTA but lesson learned. Next time a family member asks for cash just tell them you don’t have any. Family is notorious for not paying back their debts.
eg7gat,"NTA, and coddling her won’t help her self esteem issues."
eg7ixu,"NTA. You said it. If you can't afford the down payment, you can't afford the house. Not knowing the costs and responsibilities upfront can literally drive families to financial ruin. He needs to grow up and realize you're trying to look out for him."
eg7mch,"NTA. It seems to me like this was a conscious choice on your nephew’s part, and he’s chosen the 4 people that mean the most to him. His dad just ain’t it. Whatever conflict exists between him and his dad, it’s not your fault. It sounds like he wants you in that seat."
eg7msv,"NTA your aunt seems to be using you to make her actions seem less awful, and she has no right to do that. 
Depending on what kind of relationship you want to maintain with her, either avoid her and leave every time she brings this up or tell her off."
eg7o2d,"NTA - Abbey went and told Jeff something you told her in confidence and with no guidance from you as to how you wanted him told (aka.. you have no clue whether or not she used ANY tact and compassion or had any consideration for your friendship with Jeff). But more importantly ... and listen up because this is IMPORTANT! You are NOT OBLIGATED  to like ANYONE just because they like you! You do not OWE ANYONE a date. NEVER! Not because Jeff (or any other guy) likes you, and not because Abbey tells you ""you better say yes"". NO! You did exactly what you should. You followed your own heart. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY NO. No to a date. No to a kiss. No to anything else. YOU ARE NOT the asshole. 

Matter of fact, the only asshole here seems to be Abbey. She knew all along what was going down, didn't ask you your feelings about it. When she found out how you felt, she ignored your request to tell not tell him. She really doesn't seem to have your best interest at heart. Give Jeff a bit of time. His ego has been bruised, but if he is as good a friend as you think, he'll get over it."
eg7u7m,NTA - I'd just lie low until you're asked for something and then bring it up. It doesn't seem like you'll get it back :/
eg7umv,"NTA, you’re not wrong for being disappointed and calling him out. from what i can understand, this was an optional gift exchange, so there’s no reason for him to be blaming it on “having to pay rent, etc..”"
eg7uxq,"Better not to contact her, even if I get your good intentions. She may be seeing someone, and she may feel better, but you never know how traumatic that breakup could have been, and you may be a trigger even after 3 years. 
Don’t reach out yourself, but if she reaches out first, then you can apologize."
eg7v9l,"NTA, just explain why you prefer your old phone over a new one. Electronics, cosmetics, clothes as presents should be chosen very carefully, and only if you know the object’s taste."

eg812d,"NTA... if their staying with someone else, why tf are they trying to stay at your place. Also, they asked and you said no. What are they gonna do, get pissed that you won’t let THEM in YOUR house? You did want you needed because they already had somewhere to begin with."
eg82gs,NTA
eg8akm,"NTA - Taking the dog is an act of compassion. It is an animal. It does not deserve to be abused by your father. The fact that your father could be so cruel speaks volumes to who he is as a person.

If your father treats you even 1/10th as bad as he treated the dog, you should cut him out of your life."
eg8b4m,"NTA - you don't need that negativity. the constant ""disapproval"" from her about things that are important to you cannot be good for your mental health. i get where your mom is coming from somewhat, but you don't need to keep engaging with a person who seemingly refuses to be supportive."
eg8d1z,your post started strong enough but the second half was really a rambling mess
eg8e95,YTA. if you get along fine it would be silly to rock the boat over this

eg8ovy,"NAH. do not tell her, it’s not your place to out someone. it sounds like mark is unsure, let him figure things out himself."
eg8pdr,NTA - you explained to Emily and she didn't have an issue. The girl was probably lying about her crying. You have no obligation to anybody but yourself. Don't let people guilt you into abuse. I would email Emily and verify the crying...even though the girl likely lied to make you feel bad and just settle it with Emily. AND BLOCK THOSE GIRLS. They shouldn't be able to contact you if they admittedly don't like you.
eg8r57,"
OP, looks like all information about your dad's side of family came from your mom (which is already unreliable at best). So... 2 things.

1. How old are you? (Are you old enough to try reach out your dad's family side on your own?)

2. you didn't say anything about your father. Are you parents divorced or something?

NTA

Edit: Added judgement."
eg8ufd,"NTA. 

YOu aren't your parents therapist, divorce detective, or anything else. Tell them It's disappointing to know that your parents care more about getting info on each other than they do about a relationship with you, çause they keep going that's what they're gonna lose."
eg8w2v,"Lol. NTA. 

Any hurt he feels is on him. You don't do a marriage proposal even to a long term committed partner unless you know the answer is yes, and you don't come out unless it's safe. 

> Did I lead him on

He'll say you did, but these people lead themselves on. DW about it. So me people will read love/relationship into anything... or say they did in order to manipulate you. 

> to the point he revealed this to his family in such a manner?

Him coming out like *this* to his family is a hell of a choice and it's all on him not on you. 

>  I should've said yes.

A no is 100% ok. You don't need to help someone who fucking blindsides you with a proposal in front of their homophobic family with absolutely no consideration of your feelings or even your safety/perceived safety save face."
eg8xfb,Nta
eg8xjk,"NAH. It's normal to get upset and frustrated when you're working that hard.

Either way, it's still damn important for your future, so give it the best you can. But make sure you get some downtime too- play some video games, do some sports, go outside for a run, go buy candy bars or comic books."
eg8xxw,NTA. He should have helped.
eg8xzf,"NTA, you can’t force people to abandon their dinner for something like this and pretend to be happy about it. 

Also, it sounds like they were *in your house*? Can you clear that up? Doesn’t change my verdict but I‘m confused."
eg8z83,"NTA, it's a joke, it's okay to do so, like you said your brother is okay with it."
eg91n2,"YTA. It was after the movie finished, during the credits, before the extra bits. The movie is technically over, right? I'm assuming some people were leaving the theater in this time (every movie I've been in with extra scenes after the credits had a whole lot of people leaving during the credits). The group might have stopped when the extra scenes started. Their behavior was borderline rude, yours was over the line."
eg933u,NTA. That is just rude. I feel like wedding and reception is a package deal. Guest should be invited to both. Sounds like they just want a  present. I wouldn't go either.
eg95mn,"YTA because you created a toxic environment by setting this up. 

If he had passed the test I doubt he would still want to be with you after this.

You basically created his perfect woman to tempt him and put him in a situation he wouldn't be in otherwise. 

If you thought he might cheat, you should use all that energy and time to grow your relationship instead of set it up to fail."
eg9anb,"NAH but the point is being missed. Your sister should get her own car and stop relying on you guys. If she’s old enough to have a license and presumably be working then she’s old enough to sort herself out with a car, insurance and everything that goes with it"
eg9c9s,"NAH, now is not the time to be sorting out family dynamics. You’ll be unpacking stuff for a long time, it sounds like your grief is still raw- give it a couple of years. Let dust settle."
eg9icv,"NTA.

However, if there’s the option of hanging out with your friend without having to sleepover, I might go with that. I’ve been in the same situation many times with my mom, and it’s not worth the fight and/or backlash from your mom because you go back to college so soon and it would ruin the time you have at home. 

Would her sleeping over at your place be an option?"
eg9kyk,This would likely be better suited for a more relationship focused sub but YWNBTA.
eg9pqe,NTA. It is a very strange situation to my mind. Your father is like begging for the presents like a spoiled child and that\`s disgusting. A grown-up won\`t act this way.
eg9t36,"NTA 

Hell, my own *boyfriend* forgot my birthday because he was very stressed out and out of the loop thanks to work. I forgave him the second he apologised. 

Your dad needs to grow the hell up."

eg9w8g,NTA the son has 2 parents as you quite correctly said. He is not your responsibility
ega8u5,"YTA. Just because you're missing out doesn't mean your boyfriend should too. Join another, make more friends and develop your lives outside of one another."
ega926,“Giving me money was useless” ? I understand your frustration at not getting a thoughtful and personal gift but YTA for that comment.
egadms,"NTA, if your boss specifically told you to come later when he’s not in, then that’s what you should do."
egag3l,"Even when your dad doesn't support you as much as he probably could/should, it's your mom who seems like she thinks she can ""buy"" your time. She gives you more money, therefore you should not even call your dad?

So YTA, but not because you stayed with your mom, but because you didn't even called him. Ghosting him during Christmas is a shitty move, especially when you don't have any other reason than your mom wanting you all for herself. You could have avoided the shit storm by just explaining you're gonna be with mom and spend the next day or the day before with him or go there for an hour.

If he doesn't support you and you don't want him in your life, that's OK, but not by starting to pretend he doesn't exist during holidays when you even have all the gifts for him and his side of the family."

egaoxd,"NTA. Your mother shouldn’t have even asked you to come to church if she knew you didn’t believe. Taking communion is not for non believers, at least as far as my knowledge goes, anyway.

Going to church doesn’t mean you have to take communion. Your wishes should have been respected."
egaqty,"NTA: you did her a huge favor that her parents clearly never did. She learned you can’t say the first things that pop in your head and what you say matters. She clearly has no social awareness of how what she says affects others. This could tank her relationships, career and any decent friendships. One day if she grows up she’ll be thankful.

Edit: over 4K upvotes... wow. Time to update my resume."
egat5c,"YTA - Your six year old doesn't comprehend the value of $10, and a piggy back is certainly not worth $10. You could have re-framed it where your son paid $1 instead so that he learned about commitments and the babysitter learned about earning money and your son wasn't out $10."
egaxan,"YTA. You don't get to make decisions for the group without asking first, and this goes for inviting disabled people or that weird kid no one likes or the school shooter or even just someone you think is cool. Bring it up first, or go sit with them on your own, but don't force people into socializing with someone they don't know or don't want to hang out with. Now your nice gesture is going to lead to you having to hurt this girl by rejecting her friendship, or you splintering from your peer group.

You tried to be nice and that's fine, but next time you get an impulsive idea, bring it up first."
egb9jq,NTA. Your GF wants to have the proverbial cake and eat it too. She cannot change the rules with shared money willy nilly to suit herself.
egbal6,YTA for allowing your insecurity with the situation supersede the pillars of his past. You yourself probably wouldn’t even have him as a fiancée if it weren’t for her. If you honestly trusted their current situation this wouldn’t be an issue honestly.

egbbr1,"YTA. Alexia is maybe confused but she should know better - if she started working for you at 19 and that was 6 years ago, she's 25. Hardly a kid anymore. If she came on to you, that was a really stupid move, especially as you pay her well above the minimum wage, and are also her landlord (unless accommodation is provided for free, which is even a better deal - is she a living nanny?)

Your wife is understandably upset and even though you wouldn't do anything with Alexia, I too wouldn't want someone in my house who has her eyes on my husband and the father of my unborn child. 

Do the right thing, give Alexia 3 months notice for being so unprofessional and trying her luck knowing you're married, expecting a child and providing her accommodation. Write her a good reference and let her go."
egbol6,Yta. You should be working on growing closer with your wife’s family rather then distancing yourself. This will definitely lead towards your marriage ending if you say things like your family doesn’t love her
egbopc,NTA. Don’t even think twice about it.

egbqga,"YTA for not looking at a single option that involves contacting any of your roommates. 

You are currently in the home. You “never see” the roommate who works, but you know her dog is there and the dog is not being starved/dehydrated. What is preventing you from taping a note to that roommate’s door and letting her know what’s going on with the cat?"
egbtf8,"ESH. Your mom's behavior is toxic. But your behavior isn't great, either:

> This sometimes happens when I buy something from the store that I didn't want, or when I get home late or when I refuse to walk the dog when it's cold outside or when I don't call her the day I sleep elsewhere.

Your mom gets upset with you when you act irresponsibly. That's... a normal, healthy thing for her to get on your case about as you are getting older and will be leaving home soon. Spending money on things you don't even want is wasteful. Refusing to care for an animal because it's inconvenient for you is cruel and irresponsible. Not calling to let her know that you aren't dead when you don't come home is selfish and shows that you don't really understand how your behavior affects others. 

These are all *really good things* for your mom to be calling out. Her screaming and insulting you isn't okay, but that doesn't mean that she isn't right. The method is wrong, but the message is correct.

As for whether or not to cut contact - when you enlist, you'll be away from home a lot. Making a decision to cut contact now seems premature at best. The home situation you're in is tough. You are both going to change a lot over the next few years, and your relationship will necessarily change as well. There's no reason you HAVE to maintain a relationship with someone, but I'd recommend waiting and seeing how things evolve. You'll have a better sense of your own boundaries, and likely a better understanding of responsibility as a result of being in the military."

egd6l8,"I’ve been trying to figure out why your comment rubbed me the wrong way, so I’m going to try to articulate.

1. OP might have years of therapy under her belt, and it’s still ok for her to have that boundary of where she sleeps.  In fact, a therapist may have suggested the boundary.  The boundary is harmless as long as she’s paying for the hotel.  

2. Adults do not force other adults to undergo “trust exercises” against their will.  It is unacceptable for OP’s family to pressure her to sleep without a locked door in order to prove that she trusts them, and to treat her badly when she doesn’t comply.  

3. It is very controlling to try to force any kind of sleeping arrangements on another adult.  OP doesn’t need therapy so that she’ll be able to comply with their sleeping arrangement demands."

Some people are going to say we should respect other cultures but I highly disagree, that argument applies equally to all of American history where sexism/racism were more openly practiced. These practices should not be tolerated anywhere, ""but it's the tradition"" is always a bad argument."

If it's literally like 5 curse words per sentence, I'd agree that can be annoying, but there are plenty of people that just naturally use a curse word in 50% or more of the sentences they say. As long as they don't mean it in a particularly vulgar way, I don't think there is anything wrong with this."
egeunc,"YTA for lying to yourself. It is that you don’t trust her. You have obviously not moved on from the fact that she cheated on you.

egew2m,NTA for one simple fact. An average AA meeting is an hour. It may go over a little but not six hours. They are possibly going to a meeting then dinner and a movie and maybe coffee after in that time. Also they don't both have to go to the same meeting every time. They could sometimes but leaving you with a toddler and a behaviorally challenged elementary aged child for six hours every week at only 16 is absurd.

It's also baking cookies, if you can pour stuff into a cup/spoon and can count, you have mastered almost everything necessary to baking. They probably were feeling used, and as such weren't very welcoming after skipping out on all the traditions. Hard to make you feel welcome when you aren't trying to be welcomed. 

There isn't much back story on why they don't like you, so I can't really speak on that."
egf472,"NAH.  You just have to figure what’s more important to you.  And only you can decide that.  Ask yourself: can you see your brother or your boys another night?  Can you and your girl go out like this on a different night?  After those answers (so I may need INFO), figure out who is going to be hurt by your actions and decide whose feelings are justified in that and MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU.  Then make your decision and stand by it.  

  Your brother being a crazy hippy is irrelevant, btw.  Lol"
egf65n,"YTA dont use emotional manipulation to get her to cut her family off

Based on your post

* She was not the most qualified person for the job
* She had less experience over other candidates
* Her demeanor was less enthusiastic
* You know from experience she deems people who do not share her views to be **amoral** which can cause conflicts with workplace relationships and atmosphere.

It sounds like you did the right thing. I recommend you do not reply to her text messages as you risk digging yourself into a really bad legal hole. I do however recommend you bring this up with your boss to cover your bases and have a paper trail \[or at least a discussion\] on why you hired the other candidate over her."

Your dad started it. I wouldn't take issue with him not sitting at the table (my family is very close but casual and we usually don't sit at the table), but if he's going to be ranting about you on your phone(that you're not even on) he's a hypocrite."

egjoz5,"YTA. Not for your story, that's adorable, but for the way you told it. If you said it like you did here, your best day was meeting your ex. You could easily have shifted a few points of emphasis and told a story about how your best day was trying out for an audition, coming out of your shell, gaining confidence and kicking off the rest of your life. Your ex could have been the small bit player in the story of your coming up, but instead it was a story about how you got your first girlfriend."
egjrm0,NTA but this is one time where I suggest lying. Say you have a previous commitment you forgot about so they won’t think it’s personal (even though it is).
egjro4,NTA. He took something that wasn’t his.
egjsha,"ESH.  

He's the asshole for trying to change your diet and his overall demeanor towards you; his comment on your sex life was especially bad even without your miscarriage. He seems like an awful person to be around.

egk1ri,"YTA. If he didn't bring it up, why did you? That's not normal conversation topics, especially because you disagree with him doing it, it was to shame him.

egkarb,"YTA- maybe I’ll get a lot of downvotes for this but you just sound like a narcissistic asshole teenager. And the fact that you used “glow up” annoys me even more. 

Yeah you’re friends are pissed because they clearly thought you guys were friends where as you were just using them. As soon as you found people that you felt were better than them, you moved on. I mean, at the end of the day, that’s life.... you’re still TA to me though."
egkdgm,NTA. Your friends are the assholes.
egkdrc,"NTA, and you shouldn't phrase it as cutting her off because that's not what you're doing. She's continually overspent money that she didn't make (for the most part). It's not uncommon for spouses to have separate accounts at all."
egkf9e,NTA screw these entitled people.
egkljh,"NAH. If your sister is fine with it and sees it as a humorous way to catch herself when she’s splitting it isn’t anyone else’s business. If she didn’t like it or was hurt but it and you kept up you would be. But as long as she’s not you’re good. 

I’m impressed she’s so dedicated to improving herself. I’m also thrilled she’s doing DBT! the outcomes are so good and it helps so many people create positive changes."
egkqhp,"NTA, it sounds like you’ve cut your dad out of your life for understandable reasons. You’re not obligated to see him, even if he’s on his deathbed (which he isn’t).

For your own sake, it may be worth deciding if you want to be completely NC for the rest of his life. Also consider the impact this decision will have on your relationship with other family members. There’s no right or wrong answer here, but thinking through this sort of thing in advance might make things easier for you when he does eventually near the end of his life."
egkx2l,"I'd say NTA. It is your account and you have every right to do with it as you please. He is also clearly expecting you to just let him do whatever with your stuff without asking or even considering your position(s) and effectively being unsupportive of you in the same way.

If you aren't forcing your political beliefs on him what gives him the right to effectively push his on you and get what amounts to a personal endorsement among your friends/contracts?"
egkzs8,NTA.  When she posts a negative review you should post a call response with the details.  Leave the income part out of it though. Just put it was cut to length as requested and couldn’t be resold because of it.

A) you’ve taken every morsel of joy out of giving gifts—demanding prior approval—under the fake guise of “discussion” and “communication”

B) of course she’s deflated and withdraws other surprise gifts 

C) of course she wants to use gift on a non-gift-tyrant! Such s person—aka normal human—would be way more gracious and, honestly, fun"
eglf58,"NTA - this is incredibly weird and entitled. If she needs money, ask your parents for a loan. ""Passing the hat"" as if she's a college student throwing a kegger is bizarre. She chose this route knowing the expense going in. Not to mention, I can't stand this culture of having over-the-top expensively decorated nurseries, spoiler alert:  the babies don't even sleep in the nursery for the first few months nor do they care what it looks like."

eglv7i,NTA - who the fuck thinks it’s ok to just open new things at other people’s houses and use them without asking?
eglvc4,NTA. You’re allowed to be excited about getting new stuff. It seems like your family may be the assholes here for being really unbalanced in their gift-giving.
egly91,"NTA - To start, realize that you're not tasked to do anything. You're not obligated to host Christmas regardless of them being family - especially when they're not respectful of your plans or home. Your home is too small? That's a terrible consumerist mindset that you shouldn't let bother you. If you and your husband are happy with the home, that's all that matters.

Your sister should also focus on improving herself rather than judging others. That level of judgement is typically a reflection of someone's own unhappiness and insecurities. Please do not under any circumstances share/discuss any negative aspects of your relationship with her, it'll only fuel her and justify her position.

You have the right mindset in that marriage takes work. You'll have your ups and downs, your good and bad. Happily ever after and soulmates don't exist - if two people love and respect each other, and are willing to invest in that relationship, that's what matters. 

As far as your sister's expectations, she'll have terrible luck. If she wants the *perfect man*, he doesn't exist. If someone does meet her standards, unfortunately, it's probable that the love (if you want to call it that) won't be reciprocated. 

I love my wife because she stuck with me through the worst. Now I have a successful career, educated and well established, but it wasn't always that way. She was with me when I was dead broke, jobless and out of shape. I'll never take our marriage for granted knowing that. 

Point being - her looking for the perfect 'end product' will likely not end well. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it is unrealistic. She should focus on other, more important qualities instead and accept that no one is perfect."
egm3vq,"NAH. Honestly, you don’t have to tell him. If you’ve told him in the past and he isn’t listening or taking it to heart, you don’t have to wear the clothes or tell him you don’t like them. Try them in and if you really don’t like them, donate them. 

That said, if you are comfortable wearing those clothes, fine. If you’re doing it so other people are comfortable with your body, screw that. And, you don’t have to shave your armpits if you don’t like to. That doesn’t make you lazy. It makes you a human who can make choices for herself. Period."
egm6ed,"NTA. 

Your husband used your pregnancy as a way of making it easier for himself to deal with his sister, in the process betraying your trust. He knew the reason for keeping this to yourselves, he knew he did not have your permission to give out your private medical information, he did it anyways to avoid having to draw a reasonable boundary with his sister. He was a complete asshole."

Is there any chance you could discuss it with her and see if you could exchange it for something you would use?"

Edit: changed N-T-A to NAH"
egmgb5,"NTA you're allowed to have boundaries and if you don't want to receive photos like that, then you're allowed to say you don't want to receive photos like that. 

The fact that she sent them at all and then got mad at your reaction makes me wonder if she likes you? Has she shown signs of liking you before?"
egml1q,"I think you and your mum are overlooking that Cynthia has agency is this situation. She doesn’t want anything to do with your mum. Dealing with chronic depression and other medical issues are very personal forms of help to give, and the problems you describe are not problems that an outsider could directly solve or help with without the person’s explicit consent.

Your mum has some well-founded grievances with Cynthia so it’s understandable that she doesn’t want to reach out. It isn’t your mum’s responsibility to care for Cynthia, so if she decides that it wouldn’t be good for her emotional well-being to reach out, that’s OK. 

I’d encourage both of you to move away from the ‘karma’ way of looking at this - this is a person in need who has done something deeply hurtful in the past. Neither of those facts cancels out the other.

What you can do (and I would encourage you to do) is to support Arnold however you can. You may be able to direct him to charities that can help, offer him any time or resources you have, or simply be there for him when he’s stressing out about the situation with his sister. Those actions are within your control, may indirectly help, and are much less likely to encroach on either Cynthia’s privacy or your mother’s grief.

Too complex for a ruling but I’ll go NAH on the single issue of reaching out or not reaching out"
egmmqh,"NTA. It doesn’t sound like your sister has all that much to be upset about. You’re not obligated to go on a trip with her and her boyfriend. Honestly that just sounds weird. Why would she want you there? Why wouldn’t she want to be alone with him? Just something that confused me a little.

You said yourself that you never told her you wanted to go on a trip with her, and you were honest about your feelings. There’s nothing wrong with that. You are not being mean, you’re being honest and saving yourself a headache.

If your sister cares about you, she should respect your space and understand that you don’t necessarily want to do everything that she thinks you should. 

And definitely messed up that she expects you to pay for it. Honestly that’s probably the real reason she wants you and/or your mom to be there. Kind of a jerk move on her part."
egmn47,NTA. A random dude you don't know telling you you're pretty isn't a compliment -- it's a way for him to get his foot in the door to talk to you. You're not obligated to take time politely responding to every guy who thinks you're hot.
egmnmx,"NAH Frankly I'd have anxiety too if someone said ""I won't lie to you, I'm really upset right now. I don't want to talk about this until the morning."" That makes it sound like you're so angry you can't process it right now. She probably expected you to feel close to the way you said you felt so this would have been a shock to her. She probably laid awake all night wondering how you could be so mad at what happened and fearful of this newly discovered bad temper. They say couples should never go to sleep angry. Maybe that's true for roommates too. Just be careful of how you say things to her in the future."
egmokr,NTA - I can't even imagine the entitlement that someone must have to think they can get shitfaced and puke and just expect their friends to clean it up for them. Your friend should be apologizing to you for subjecting you to having to watch them get drunk and vomit.
egmp8l,"NTA. She should have taken better care of your calculator. You should be direct and tell her what you want, a new calculator. She should replace it."
egmsnq,"Good for you for getting out and doing things on your own. Absolutely NTA. 

He’s been invited. He declined. He’s crazy and sounds selfish to expect you to not enjoy life and experiences because he wants to be a bore. It’s unfortunate he won’t  and doesn’t care to do these things with you. Life is short... sometimes you have to put yourself first and make yourself happy and it sounds like your doing just that."
egmusj,"ESH - Foul called on you for not finding a nicer way to tell your wife you think work should be a priority. Saying she doesn’t deserve a vacation is rude. Unemployment isn’t a long vacation. It’s stressful knowing you are a burden to the ones you love. Anyone would want an escape from that and to celebrate the end of it. 

Foul called on your wife for her “IDGAF” attitude. She needs to ask for the time off. If denied, she needs to put the family finances first and keep her job."
egmusp,"NTA. He sounds deranged. I don't understand what the problem was with the new friend hire at all.

egmylq,"I vote NTA, though I'd think you should discuss it with your partner more than us. Also, if your girl is so young, yeah it's more a trip for you than her, as she'll be too young to remember anything, just something to keep in mind."
egn0hi,"Jeez, NTA and the photographer is a jerk for not consulting you."
egn2ds,"NTA. My friend, depending on the size of this dog, you should maybe consider the damage it can do. The fact that your partner sees nothing wrong with it being violent is somewhat scary. Please don’t ever let this dog be left alone around children."

egnklp,"ESH. Your mom sounds like someone who never grew up, but you were absolutely rude to her. That said, this is a situation where you were kind of an asshole, but also right to stand up for yourself. So it does pain me to say everyone sucks.

That said, while this is not a dating advice page, I do have to say that you're not going to find the perfect guy randomly. I definitely can understand your Mom turning you off to the whole concept of dating around, but dating does tend to lead to long term relationships with good people if you go in with the right intentions."
egnqln,"Dear Lord in Heaven above us. NAH.
Why did she show you?? As a vag owner, I never would have shown my warty hooha to ANYONE but a gyno. Bless you for even looking at it, I definitely would have made a face too.

You’re right, show your support and wait it out. Talk to your girl and emphasize your support. It’s a medical issue that sounds disgusting as all hell, so she can’t expect you to treat it like you’re looking at roses.

Edit: spelling

egnsvd,"This one is tough. I’ll say ESH but VERY gently. 

Your friends obviously shouldn’t have strung you along like that, so that sucks. 

Then you released a tirade on them (fair) but now they’ve tried apologizing multiple times and you aren’t giving them the chance to. People make mistakes OP, let them own it and move on as a group. 

I hope you get to feeling better and have a happy new year!"
egnswq,"So she paid you $200, and $100 was used on gas and the car inspection, leaving you with $100 left.

If you had picked her up you’d “profit” whatever you didn’t spend on gas on the second trip. 

I’d offer a compromise and give her back whatever you spent on gas the first time, it’s not really fair if you took off work (either not getting paid or burning a PTO day) and she basically just paid for the gas + inspection and didn’t compensate for time + labor.

Tbh, she sounds like a crappy roommate and I’d make it clear that if this is the hill she wants to die on then you won’t be driving her anywhere again in the future. She sounds super entitled, so I’m going to go with NTA."
egnt3w,"NTA

He's clearly been indoctrinated into a new Whoop cult. He is past the point of saving. If you value your life, run while you can before they have a chance to tag you with a device which can measure your napping frequency. 

Also, you don't have to be excited for every hobby your SO has, or for any of them to be honest. It also sounds like a pretty tedious conversation to have multiple times. Especially the part(s) where he mentions his fellow cultist's stats.

Maybe a thing to talk about in therapy is why you don't love and respect yourself enough that you stay in a relationship with an emotionally/verbally abusive cheater. Or maybe get a new therapist if he/she is advising you to put yourself through this."

You're growing out if this 'dark humour'/edgelord bullshit, as you understand how hurtful and divisive it can be.

egpy54,"NTA if she'd been planning it for that long, she should have asked your parents first. She's probably trying to guilt you to give it up because she's promised it to her friends, but then realized she forgot to actually ask to have it.

Her irresponsibility is not your responsibility.

I also doubt your parents would want a bunch of high schoolers partying unsupervised..."
egpylh,"YTA. Your friend probably agreed to help before checking the logistics. Who knows their situation maybe they don't have internet banking set up or whatever so it takes longer. Or maybe they've had  pretty tough holiday period so it wasn't top of their priorities. 

You should have cancelled your DDs when you realised you were in financial difficulty so you could manually transfer the fund only after knowing that they were in your account. That would have saved some of the stress.

Yes they seem flaky and that's never nice to deal with, but it's your friend and you definitely don't want money to come between you two, so cut them some slack. I know if might cost you a bit in the short term, but you have a job lined up so this time next year you won't notice the financial inconvenience it causes now. 

By all means remind them about it but do it in a nice way. ""I just wanted to see if it was still cool, because if there's any problems I'd ask my other friend/family instead"""
egpywh,This is an explanation on how much euros are in dollars and not a judgement on anything else the OP wrote
egpzgt,"NTA. ""An attractive girl like you shouldn't smoke. It makes you less attractive."" That line right there. He's an asshole, be glad you smelled like asshole repellant. Fuk that guy

Edit: And I don't care if he didn't say those words exactly, everyone here knows what he meant."
egq1pq,"NTA,

The cheek of lori to indirectly ask you to not go to a holiday for no reason, and then be mad thet you're mad is unbelievable"
egq55e,"Wait, your wife got presents for everyone but you? Is that right? Did you ask her about that?"
egq6rg,"NTA. He's an adult with responsibilities. And it's the child that will suffer. it sounds like he's left you no choice. 

The longer you leave it the harder it will be. If he moves and doesn't tell you tracking him could be a problem. Definitely get it done now."
egq8u4,"NTA Im from the UK here its not illegal but idk for Malaysia

You should complain, they gave you money that they would refuse to accept, it shouldn't be in the till if that's the case."
egq9ve,"Totally NTA. Honestly, I would’ve done the same thing. I lost both of my grandfathers but my paternal grandma is super misogynistic while my maternal grandma is just senile. But, all the relatives who live in India are just so goddamn sucky and misogynistic I just can’t. I feel you."
egqb3p,"Your mom is an asshole, but since it's done I would give your daughter the straight up news that your family is way too busy for caring for the rabbit and if she wants it, the care is all on her and the minute she fucks up the rabbit goes back.  And I'd stick with it."
egqf54,"NTA and I’m glad your husband is supporting you. So many people who have problem with their in laws don’t have husbands that support them.

Maybe try reaching out in a few weeks to see what’s up, but if she’s still toxic then you were right in your first assumption and you don’t need to put up with her."
egqf6u,"NTA. It sucks if your event doesn't have any guidelines on how elaborate the artwork was supposed to be, but spending 16+ hours and in return getting something that isn't even recognizable as your character is definitely a reason to be disappointed. I would try and explain this to one of the admins or the person who got you the piece, see what they have to say about it."
egqhw3,"I’m going to buck the trend and say NTA.

I get how you feel, kids are damn exhausting.  If the situation is as you describe it and you just want a 24-hour stay-cation that’s understandable!

But I think the reason you are getting blasted is because of your wording.  People think you’re laying out an ultimatum, whereas I think you’re maybe dealing with guilt.  I’d suggest asking for this as one more Christmas gift, mommy’s stay-cation, then perhaps it frames it as something everyone can be excited about."
egqojk,"""...she started fighting with my roommate loud, screaming at 3 AM for what went on for an hour or more...""

That's intolerable. And it gives you all every right to refuse to have her in the house again. The rest of it-- utility bills, etc-- doesn't even need to be mentioned after that incident. NTA."
egqq9h,"NTA that was tacky of your mum for just immediately asking to regift it, and shitty of her to then blame you for ruining her mood"
egqrez,"NTA, but talk to her! Be blunt and direct, the dog's health is important."
egqwdk,"You do realize they're not going to care about receiving newsletters? 

Nta but you aren't doing yourself any favors by signing them up for silly newsletters."
egqxsz,"Nope, you are NTA. You don’t owe either sibling your time and service, it’s your choice to help out sometimes, or never. You have explained the reasoning clearly to them but actually quite nicely and kindly (too much for me to handle rather than saying they are mini freakin psychopaths etc.)

If they keep giving you shit for your decision then just tell them you are focusing on something else - study/work/hobbies or whatever and move even further from being used and under appreciated. 

You could extend an olive branch and say you’ll come and hang out with them whilst sis is there, and she will have to warn them to be on best behaviour. If they do well, you may change your mind for a future occasion. If the kids enjoy hanging out or are jealous their cousins get to play with you, it may be the right motivation."
egr1ci,"ESH - your gf is an opportunistic golddigging user, and you are dating someone you know you don't respect."
egr1v9,"30 person meeting and 35 people on conference call? I’m calling shitpost. But just in case it isn’t, NTA."
egr3u3,"ESH

>The next day he replied to my text in a very arrogant way listing all the things that he doesn't like about me (that I don't wash up the blender right after I used it - which he never uses, that I don't drain the water in the bathtub - which he also never uses

I mean you can't complain about his stuff and then not acknowledge your own. If what you truly wanted was for him to start doing better. When he points these things out it makes it very easy for you to just stop these things so he has nothing to gripe about and you would be completely right. What this sounds like is that you both have minor issues to sort through. There isn't anything wrong with what you're saying. But there isn't anything wrong with what he said either. Both of you should do better."
egrhvl,NAH.  I don't think you have any obligation to Liz or to her child beyond offering to share medical history.  And I don't blame Liz for reaching out to you to let you know.
egrivi,"NTA, but contact social services / elder care. Some jurisdictions have laws about neglect of elder family members, so it's best both for them and for you if you make sure that your efforts to assist them are on record and you get a chance both to explore options to sort out their living conditions / get them on the radar of people who can work with them."
egrk54,"Your boyfriend sounds like the asshole,  not you"
egrmta,"NTA. I’m sure he wouldn’t feel the same way about your husband going to a strip club. But the unintended consequence might be that he *prefers* you not speak unless spoken to, in which case, don’t give him the satisfaction."
egrsu0,YTA for the misleading clickbait title.
egrumr,NAH- I understand from your dads point of view because it’s his secret to tell. Your parents are divorced so it’s not like he cheated on her and he has the right to tell your mom when he’s ready. BUT going to Disneyland with your new sister without your mom knowing yet is kinda awkward.  He should probably tell her first if that’s something he wants.
egrw1u,NTA it’s another student telling you this. You should’ve ignored them from the beginning.
egrws9,NTA That's how lottery works. Whether or not it makes sense to teach them to spend money in the lottery is another topic.
egrxqz,"YTA. This wasn't a punishment, this was a public humiliation, and you know it.

>I have treated this child as my own since she was four. I think I have every right to parent her. 

You don't have any right to go over her mother's head and ""take matters into your own hands."""
egs0s1,"NTA

You're NOT ""wasting police resources"", you are doing exactly the opposite of that. I would keep calling. It's sweet that you care so much."
egs12n,"YTA.  There is no such thing as ""playful shaming"".  You're being a jerk by insulting her and a bit of an ass by contriving to fit in a way to talk about your "" skinny girlfriend with fake boobs who’s also an Ivy League graduate and an Instagram model. """
egs1fy,[deleted]
egs2dr,"Try r/ relationshipadvice 

Anyway, NAH, just be honest with her. Nothing else will solve this."
egs2un,"NAH. No point returning the blanket now though, either the damage has been done or you're in the clear."
egs48t,"YTA. Let me get this straight. You ""didn’t believe she had cancer at first,"" and apparently weren't convinced until after her mastectomy. You ""never even helped during her first treatment"" and now you're ""exhausted by the cancer talk."" And even though she's told you ""the chances of it coming back"" are ""high,"" you're more inclined to believe your ""mom’s friend"" who said ""if you take the meds after it is far less likely to return,"" even though you have no reason to assume your mom's friend has the same type/stage/treatment plan/prognosis as your ex. You don't know the name of your special needs son's doctor, and you can't be bothered finding out. You said you'd accompany your wife to an appointment with your son's doctor but then you didn't show. And now you've told her she's ""being dramatic"" and you'll ""answer no further messages containing the word cancer unless she finds out she's actually dying,"" even though she's not asking you to be her ""friend,"" she's asking you to parent your son.

I sincerely hope this is a shitpost, because otherwise you're one of the biggest A's I've ever encountered in this sub.

>I recently talked to my brother who works in the medical profession and he says that she may have had an aggressive cancer but there is no way to know.

If only there was some way to find out. /s"
egs4js,NTA - Starting a restaurant is a great way to go bankrupt and deep in debt. I’m sure there is something that she can do with food as a side business.
egs565,Those dresses you selected  are hideous.  They wouldn’t look good on a 60 year old woman let alone a 16 year old.  What is with all that extra draping on that green velvet monstrosity?   The ivory lace one has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.   Why are you obsessed with covered arms?  Do biceps offend you? This isn’t Little House on the Prarie.  Nobody would feel good about themselves wearing those.
egs5yt,"NTA - you ordered something, we’re kind enough to offer some for them, and they basically ate it all. Inconsiderate and rude of them. 

Buuuuuuut being 13 sucks and there’s not much you can do. Rest assured your morally in the right, but I doubt your mum cares by the sounds of it unfortunately."
egsa1p,"NTA it's your phone and your social life. You should be able to trust your family. Unless your parents have given you other ground rules like being able to check-in on your phone and such, go ahead and change that password."
egsb03,"NTA, it sounds like she either misunderstood or needed to misunderstand to avoid admitting to herself that her drinking and drugs were the problem. 

Now, I CAN sort of see where she might have gotten that idea, since you stopped talking to her around that Time she got a girlfriend ands used euphemisms in your text. It’s also unclear if you ever talked about not liking her drug use so maybe she was blindsided. IMO, you would have been doing her a service in being more clear in the text about why instead of saying “going different directions”. 

But let me emphasize that doesn’t make you the asshole. It just would have made things easier, and at least you’d know you were super clear."
egsbn7,"NTA. You are an adult now and it's only natural to start wanting to spend time with your friends during events like this. 

Go to the party, have a great time and don't feel bad about it."
egseek,"Info:   Why aren’t you using parental leave in January?

It makes sense that you’d want to work in December for the bonus, but what exactly is preventing you from taking the time later on?"
egsgbe,"YTA but gently.

My mantra is “never give money you can’t afford to lose”.   

Your mom needs a service, you need money. Seems like a  pretty reasonable transaction to me. You don’t get to hold over her head that you’ve done for her."
egsgs9,NAH. She already apologized for overreacting. There’s no issue here.
egshaz,"Nta. Just bc someone is family, doesn't mean you should turn a blind eye to their bullshit."
egsm8j,"ESH 

Your boyfriend sucks for being that terrible with money.   When you are broke, you don’t get to do things like go to the gun range and spend a bunch of money on ammo. You spend that money on food. 


However, you suck for enabling him. For bailing him out and helping to create a situation where he doesn’t need to solve his problems because you bail him out. 


Stop doing that.     He was obviously competent enough to get a well paying job in the first place. He can do so again. Or he could get a second job since he isn’t even working full time."
egsmtm,"NAH, they're yours to do with what you like, but I'd consult a jeweler about whether it's the right move. It would be a shame to lose that history."
egsnib,NTA but your mother is a huge AH.  You've got a compromised immune system because of chemo and your mum has this attitude???
egsvx6,"NTA. None of them are friends to you and you should ditch all three of them permanently. It might be different if their group chat was for some shared interest that you aren't involved in (like D&D or something similar), but to just exclude you from a random group deliberately for no stated reason is bullshit and proves they care nothing about you unless it's convenient for them or something you can do for them."
egsxuh,"WTF does her going out with friends have to do with the decorations?

If you’re the one who has to take it all down and this is the time you have to do it, then you’re not TA.

But if you’re doing it as “punishment” which is how your post reads then ESH. Her for being irresponsible, you for being vindictive."
