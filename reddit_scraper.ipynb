To me it seems you were using the part that you did have control over to support your kid in how he wanted to look and who he is, but then your ex subverted that as a passive-aggressive act which is an affront to you (obviously) but I get the sense that you\\'re more upset that he is being bullied by the people who should be giving him unconditional love and support *and* that he basically got forced into changing his hair so that some people around him could feel better.\\n\\nI think that you should consider the issue that is underlying this stuff - who your kid is and how he is being raised. If you turn this somewhat small issue into a huge one then it\\'s going to be a big shitfight that could drag out and affect both kids in a bad way. What you *do* need to do is, in my not-so-humble opinion, is to support your kid as best you can to allow him to be himself (and hopefully in time to be confident enough to say \"No, this is my hair and I don\\'t want it to be cut like that. I will compromise and get it trimmed/neatened-up but you do not get to choose my hairstyle for me\"). He\\'s probably feeling shit about this whole episode, and I doubt he wants it to turn into a tug-of-war that lasts for months where everybody loses, he probably just wants to feel sad about it for a while and then to move on with life. In your shoes I\\'d talk to him about how he feels about his hair and if he wants to talk about it. Be careful here - remember that you\\'re not trying to get him to dish the dirt on your ex. Ask him for permission first if he confides in you and you want to discuss it with your ex. If you go over his head (ha!) on this then he\\'s going to feel even more pushed around and even less empowered than he did after he was forced to get his hair cut.\\n\\nSo, what to do? \\n\\nI\\'d say once you\\'ve cooled off enough that *maybe* you could explain to your ex why you are upset about the haircut episode and that you feel as if he is being forced to act in a way that puts other people\\'s comfort above his happiness and his identity, which isn\\'t good for his self esteem and it\\'s not okay by you.\\n\\nI\\'d ask him if there is something that you could do to make it up to him (even if it means getting a silly wig from the dollar store and spending some time styling that into a crazy haircut or something). I\\'d let him know that you are sad and maybe even a little upset that he was forced to have a haircut in a style that he didn\\'t like but that you aren\\'t angry with him.\\n\\nThe next two things I\\'d suggest are very much based on context and your relationship to him, so be cautious if you do decide to do either or both because it could backfire and cause a stink. You *could* let your son know that you would be happy to dye his hair any color he chooses (you could definitely save that one for 6 months down the track and use the \"well I thought that we weren\\'t consulting one another on hairstyling anymore, and at least he *wanted* this one\" line. But I\\'m a vengeful person at heart - can\\'t you tell? :P) You could also talk to him about ways to deal with bullies - what can you say to people who are making you do something you don\\'t want to, what can you say to people who are teasing you about your interests, that kind of stuff - and maybe even explain how you stood up to someone and the process of it (like how it was scary but you stood your ground and told someone that it\\'s not nice to make someone feel bad about themselves etc.).\\n\\nBut really what you need to do is be the bigger person - tell him that you love him no matter what his hair is like, and you think that he\\'s really brave for being honest about liking my little pony despite being teased about it, and that you will never reject him. Tell him that if you ever accidentally make him feel ashamed about himself or who he is that he should say so immediately because you *never* want to make him feel bad about who he is. And really, this is the long game you\\'re playing here - I can see that you and your ex didn\\'t end things on the best of terms and that communication between you two is not so great. You even have some pretty different ideas about parenting. If you are angry about the stuff between you and your ex then put that energy into showing them up and being the better parent - not the one who talks their ex down to their kids, not the one who lets their kids do anything - but the one who is accepting, nurturing, loving, caring, and non-judgmental; the one your kids can come to with anything. If getting back at your ex means being a better parent than they could ever hope to be at least that means that your kids still win.

So, if the offender does make another comment that the others should agree is abusive, you should immediately speak up, and this will probably demonstrate your value to them as the raiser of standards, and probably get at least two of the partners on your side immediately, making it much easier to convince him that he's wrong, or control him he doesn't immediately come around.

Pizza delivery people have the ability to navigate apartment complexes.\\n\\n It\\'s understandable that the delivery person did not want to give you their personal number. When I delivered pizza, I got so many calls back later in the night from customers, I ended up changing phone numbers. A pizza delivery driver is not going to get a trap phone for delivering pizza.\\n\\nA pizza delivery person also has a very short time limit. When a pizza delivery person is \"on the road,\" their pay is significantly cut. In-store for me was 7.25, while on the road for me was 2 dollars. We had to be back before the computer showed the deliveries \"in the red.\" Otherwise, we would be reprimanded. We were expected to run from the store to the car, run to the house, and then run back to the car, even if we were injured. I got screamed at and cursed out multiple times by managers because I had an injured leg and could not sprint to the car, I could only half limp-jog. \\n\\nFor this reason (time constraints,) a pizza delivery person should not be expected to wait anywhere from 30 seconds to an hour for you to arrive to their vehicle. And yes, a customer has tried to make me wait an hour on more than one occasion. \\n\\nEvery time I have been given a false address, I have been mugged or been almost mugged. Going to a fake address is a very scary experience. You can tell the house is empty and it makes your heart pound to just stand there alone, knocking. \\n\\nIf you want to get a pizza delivered, but do not want to give your address, then schedule a meet-up at one of your local pizzaias meet up locations. The other option is to do a carry out order. \\n\\nThere are many advantages to a carry out order. \\n\\nA pizza, from start to finish, averages ten minutes. That\\'s three on the make table, seven in the oven, and one on the cut table. That means that you can order the pizza and drive to the store and expect it to be ready immediately. Depending on the day. This ensures ensures a hot pie. \\n\\nDuring a carry out order, you can check your order for accuracy. This ensures a pie with no mistakes. \\n\\nDuring a carry out order, there is not a 2.50 delivery fees and 5 dollar tip. This takes 7.50 off of the total of your order. \\n\\n\\nYou\\'re not an asshole, you\\'re just uninformed. Now, you can make an informed decision while ordering pizza. \\n\\n\\nEdit: \\n\\nI seriously doubt that OP called to order because if he had said \"please have them call me upon arrival,\" the CSR Probably would have said \"I\\'m sorry, we can\\'t do that, but we can call at departure.\" If she was a good CSR. If he had said \"I\\'m giving you the wrong address,  so have them call me upon arrival,\" the CSR would most likely say something along the lines of \"I\\'m sorry, I\\'ll need to get the correct address for accuracy/so the mileage can be properly paid for(some companies pay a few cents per mile,) so we don\\'t disturb the owners of the house at the address, etc.\"\\n\\n The other option would be that he ordered online. When ordering online and putting in special requests, it usually limits you to a certain character count. So I assume that OP only put down \"call upon arrival\" instead of \" call when you get here, I put down the wrong address on purpose.\" \\n\\nNow, I disagree with what the driver did in this case. When I stopped using my personal phone for work. I started calling upon departure. I would say something like \"this is princess dolly, I\\'m about to depart from dominos, I will be arriving approximately at 7:46 with your pizza.\" \\n\\nThen, I would run out of the store to the car and drive on over. \\n\\nThe driver did not call upon departure.

It wasn\\'t wrong of her to give you a chance, but if she were more mature, she probably would have realized sooner that it wasn\\'t going anywhere and been honest with you about it.\\n\\nAlso, long distance relationships are generally a pretty bad idea for people your age.

Even if you had talked about being exclusive, you probably should have caught the hint that she wouldn\\'t call you a boyfriend as a sign that she probably didn\\'t want to be in a relationship of that kind. And yes she may have lied to you, but she\\'s trying to sort through some complex emotions right now and it\\'s understandable that she didn\\'t feel like she could be completely honest at first.

I get to the pharmacy counter with  my other, travel-related stuff and provide the guy at the counter my information for my prescription. As he is ringing me up, I explained to him (twice) that the benefits card I have for my HSA (health spending account) only has about $60 dollars left on it for the year and I want to put that towards part of my $116 prescription. I just wanted to avoid swiping that card and having it declined or cause any confusion. He seemed to understand what I was asking and said he just put the partial payment amount in for $60 and to swipe that card. As soon as I did, the amount on the key pad was subtracted, but the credit machine didnt prompt me to sign for it like I usually do. I paid for the rest of my transaction with my regular credit card and went on my business. When I got home, I noticed on the receipt he rang through the stuff that should have been on my HSA as cash- there’s nothing on the receipt that notes my HSA card was used.

If the answer is yes, then you may need to evaluate your expectations and focus on building a support network of people who you trust outside of your family. \\n\\nWhether you are an asshole or not depends on how you react. Keep living the best life for you and remember that compassion is best, but don't allow people to walk all over you. And being proud of your father for giving up his vices should be told to him no matter what.

Meanwhile he’s apologizing to the employee profusely, for the trouble.\\n\\nI felt like this was incredibly humiliating but he told me that I needed to learn how to take a joke and that it was just banter. I was on the verge of crying when this was happening, though he didn’t know that. I ended up being incredibly pissed over it, and called him an asshole, and when he said that I just needed to learn to take a joke and that it was “subjectively funny”, not an objectively asshole thing to do. Things really exploded and it turned into a pretty heated argument.\\n\\nHe still says it was a joke and that I need to get a sense of humor.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This time it seemed much more extreme though, like they weren't just venting and actually needed help. \\n\\nI emailed a guidance counselor at our school. She didn't answer for a while so I emailed a teacher me and the two friends in question all know. He is good with kids and their emotions, and handles stuff like this a lot. \\n\\nI didn't tell my friends before I sent the emails. I was worried and wanted to contact adults asap. When I saw them at school, I told my friends about the emails. They got upset. Later they texted me that they were mad. \\n\\nI went during my lunch and talked to the teacher I emailed. He told me I did the right thing, but I got more texts from my friends later that made me feel worse. \\n\\nThey both are struggling, but now getting help. They were mad at me for talking to other people about it bc they wanted to keep it private. I didn't realize from the texts that they actually planned on getting help.

It's a bit rude of them to keep inviting you to these things, but I'd bet that they're just inviting you to things in general!! Which, as it goes without saying, is awesome.
